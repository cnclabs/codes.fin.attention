credit risk credit risk management is a critical and fully integrated component of our management and growth strategy 
we have developed a risk management structure to manage credit and other risks facing our business 
credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from borrower default when a borrower is unable or unwilling to meet their financial obligations to discover 
our credit risk is generally highly diversified across millions of accounts without significant individual exposures  accordingly  we manage risk on a portfolio basis 
we have a risk committee  the discover financial services risk committee  that is composed of our senior management and is responsible for the establishment of criteria relating to risk management 

table of contents new cardmembers all credit applications are subject to an underwriting process that assesses the creditworthiness of each applicant 
in terms of identifying potential cardmembers  we give consideration to the prospective cardmember s financial stability  as well as ability and willingness to pay 
prospective cardmembers applications are evaluated using credit information provided by the credit bureaus and other sources 
credit scoring systems  both externally developed and proprietary  are used to evaluate cardmember and credit bureau data 
we assign credit lines to our cardmembers on the basis of risk level  income and expected card usage 
we use experienced credit underwriters to supplement our automated decision making processes 
approximately of all applications are subject to manual review that covers the areas of key cardmember data verification  fraud prevention and approval of higher credit lines

portfolio management proactive management of a cardmember s account is a critical part of credit management  and all accounts are subject to ongoing credit assessment 
this assessment reflects information relating to the performance of the individual s discover account as well as information from a credit bureau relating to the cardmember s broader credit performance 
this information is used as an integral part of credit decision making as well as for management reporting purposes 
scoring models statistical evaluation models support the measurement and management of credit risk 
at the individual cardmember level  we use custom risk models together with generic industry models as an integral part of the credit decision making process 
depending on the duration of the cardmember s account  risk profile and other performance metrics  the account may be subject to a range of account management treatments  including eligibility for marketing initiatives  authorization  increases or decreases in retail and cash credit limits  pricing adjustments  and delinquency strategies 
cardmember assistance authorizations 
each transaction is subject to screening and approval through a proprietary point of sale pos decision system 
this system utilizes rules based decision making logic  statistical models and data integrity checks to manage fraud and credit risks 
strategies are subject to regular review and enhancement to enable us to respond quickly to changing credit conditions as well as to protect our cardmembers and the business from emerging fraud activity 
proactive account management 
we use a variety of collection and recovery strategies  with overdue delinquent accounts scored and segmented to tailor the collection approach 
we employ predictive call campaigns  as well as offering payment programs for certain cardmembers to find customized solutions that fit their financial situation 
we employ tools such as payment email reminders  flexible payment plans and a collections website designed to educate and assist cardmembers with their payment needs 
our payment plans are designed to help bring accounts out of delinquency or overlimit exposure 
collections 
all monthly billing statements of accounts with past due amounts include a request for payment of such amounts 
these accounts also receive a written notice of late fee charges  as well as an additional request for payment  after the first monthly statement that reflects a past due amount 
collection personnel generally initiate contact with cardmembers within days after any portion of their balance becomes past due 
the nature and the timing of the initial contact  typically a personal call or letter  are determined by a review of the cardmember s prior account activity and payment habits 
for higher risk accounts  as determined by statistically derived predictive models  telephone contacts may begin as soon as the account becomes past due 
lower risk cardmembers are typically contacted by letter and further collection efforts are determined by behavioral scoring  financial exposure and the lateness of the payment 

table of contents we reevaluate our collection efforts and consider the implementation of other techniques as a cardmember becomes increasingly delinquent 
we limit our exposure to delinquencies through controls within the authorizations system and criteria based account suspension and revocation 
in situations involving a cardmember with financial difficulties  we may enter into arrangements to extend or otherwise change payment schedules 
recovery 
credit card loans are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes days contractually past due 
the only exceptions are bankrupt accounts  deceased customers  accounts on payment hardship or settlement programs  and fraudulent transactions  which are charged off earlier 
we use various recovery techniques and channels that include internal collection activities  use of collections agencies and legal action 
the timing and choice of channel utilized are subject to a recovery optimization strategy that encompasses factors such as cost and duration against expected recovery effectiveness

these data centers support our discover and pulse networks  diners club processing  and provide cardmembers with access to their accounts and manage transaction authorizations  among other functions 
our approach to technology development and management involves both third party and in house resources 
we use third party vendors for basic technology services eg  telecommunications  hardware and operating systems 
each vendor participates in a formal selection process to ensure that we have partners that can provide us with a cost effective and reliable technology platform 
this approach enables us to focus our in house resources on building proprietary systems eg  for cardmember and merchant settlement  authorizations and customer relationship management that we believe enhance our operations  improve cost efficiencies and help distinguish us in the marketplace 
discover card terms and conditions the terms and conditions governing our products vary by product and change over time 
each cardmember enters into an agreement governing the terms and conditions of the cardmember s account 
discover card s terms and conditions are generally uniform from state to state 
the cardmember agreement permits us to change some credit terms  including the annual percentage rates and the fees imposed on accounts  with notice to the cardmember 
the cardmember has the right to opt out of certain changes of terms and pay their balance off under the old terms 
each cardmember agreement provides that the account can be used for purchases  cash advances and balance transfers 
each discover card account is assigned a credit limit when the account is initially opened 
thereafter  individual credit limits may be increased or decreased from time to time  at our discretion  based primarily on our evaluation of the cardmember s creditworthiness 
discover bank offers various features and services with the discover card accounts  including the cashback bonus reward described under marketing rewards cashback bonus 
discover card accounts generally have the same billing and payment structure  though there are some differences between the consumer and business credit cards  as described below 
unless we waive the right to do so  we send a monthly billing statement to each cardmember who has an outstanding debit or credit balance 
cardmembers also can waive their right to receive a physical copy of their bill  in which case they will receive email notifications of the availability of their billing statement online at the discover card account center 
discover card accounts are grouped into multiple billing cycles for operational purposes 
each billing cycle has a separate billing date  on which we process and bill to cardmembers all activity that occurred in the related accounts during the period of approximately to days that ends on that date 
we offer fixed and variable rates of periodic finance charges on accounts 
neither cash advances nor balance transfers are subject to a grace period 
periodic finance charges on purchases are calculated on a daily basis  subject to a grace period that essentially provides that periodic finance changes are not imposed if cardmembers pay their entire balance each month 
certain account balances  such as balance transfers  may accrue periodic finance charges at lower fixed rates for a specified period of time 
variable rates are indexed to the highest prime rate published in the wall street journal on the last business day of the month 
additional consumer card terms 
each cardmember with an outstanding debit balance in his or her consumer discover card account must generally make a minimum payment each month 
if a cardmember exceeds his or her credit limit as of the last day of the billing period  we may include all or a portion of this excess amount in the cardmember s minimum monthly payment 
from time to time  we have offered and may continue to offer eligible cardmembers the opportunity to not make the minimum monthly payment  while continuing to accrue periodic finance charges  without being considered past due 
a cardmember may pay the total amount due at any time 
we also may enter into arrangements with delinquent cardmembers to extend or otherwise change payment schedules  and to waive finance charges  fees and or principal due  including re aging accounts in accordance with regulatory guidance 
income may be reduced during any period in which we offer cardmembers the opportunity to not make the minimum monthly payment or to extend or change payment schedules 

table of contents in addition to periodic finance charges  we may impose other charges and fees on discover card accounts  including cash advance transaction fees  late fees where a cardmember has not made a minimum payment by the required due date  overlimit fees for balances that exceed a cardmember s credit limit as of the close of the cardmember s monthly billing cycle  balance transfer fees  returned payment fees  pay by phone fees  and fees for each time we decline to honor a balance transfer check  cash advance check  or other promotional check due to such reasons as insufficient credit availability  delinquency or default 
we use the two cycle average daily balance method for determining periodic finance charges for some consumer card accounts  which is sometimes referred to as two cycle billing 
we expect to eliminate the two cycle average daily balance method for those accounts in mid the two cycle average daily balance method means that if a cardmember begins a billing cycle with no outstanding balance  makes purchases and then does not pay the balance outstanding at the end of that billing cycle by the payment due date and therefore loses the grace period to avoid finance charges on those purchases  finance charges are imposed on those purchases for both the current billing cycle and the previous billing cycle as of the transaction date 
terms and conditions may vary for other products  such as the discover business card and discover motiva card 
payments and merchant relationships merchant relationships we support our growing base of merchants through a merchant acquiring model that includes direct relationships with the largest merchants in the united states and outsourced arrangements with our merchant acquiring partners for small and mid size merchants 
we have chosen to retain direct relationships with most of our largest merchant accounts because many prefer dealing with us directly  we are able to retain the entire discount revenue from the merchant  and we are able to capitalize on joint marketing programs and opportunities 
competitor networks and credit card issuers typically do not enjoy direct relationships with merchants 
since mid  discover network has worked with merchant acquirers to allow them to begin offering a comprehensive payments processing package for small and mid size merchants that includes consolidated servicing for discover  visa and mastercard transactions 
integrated payments solutions provide these merchants with streamlined statementing and customer service 
in some cases  discover has sold and will continue to sell small and mid size merchant acquiring portfolios to third party acquirers to facilitate integrated servicing and reduced costs 
in addition to our us based merchant acceptance locations  discover network cards also are accepted through relationships with in country banks and processors at many locations in canada  mexico and the caribbean 
also  over the past three years we have signed reciprocal network agreements with china unionpay and jcb that enable our cardmembers to use their discover network cards in china and  expected in  in japan 
networks and merchant operations account governance  regulations and specifications 
the terms of our direct merchant relationships are governed by a merchant services agreement msa 
these msas also are accompanied by additional program documents that further define our network functionality and requirements  including operating regulations  technical specifications and dispute rules 
to enable ongoing improvements in our network s functionality and in accordance with industry convention  we publish updates to our program documents on a semi annual basis 
in a growing number of cases  particularly with small and mid size merchants  the merchants enter into agreements directly with a merchant acquirer  and not with discover 
new accounts 
merchants can now apply to accept all discover network cards utilizing the same process used to accept all other card brands 
to facilitate this process  discover network has partnered with all of the top acquirers in the industry 
these acquirer partners perform credit evaluations and screen applications against unacceptable business types and the office of foreign asset control specifically designated nationals list 
once approved  the acquirer transmits an electronic file to discover network registering the new merchants enabling transaction acceptance

our systems evaluate incoming merchant sales activity to identify abnormalities that require investigation prior to the initiation of settlement 
risk management personnel are responsible for validating compliance with our operating regulations and law  including enforcing our data security standards and our prohibitions against internet gambling and other illegal or otherwise unacceptable activities 
discover network is a founding and current member of the payment card industry pci security standards council  llc  and requires merchants and service providers to comply with the pci data security standard 
competition we compete with other card issuers and networks on the basis of a number of factors  including merchant acceptance  products and services  incentives and reward programs  brand  network  reputation and pricing 
many of our competitors are well established and financially strong  have greater financial resources than we do  are larger than we are and or have lower capital  funding and operating costs than we have and expect to have 
as a credit card issuer  we compete for accounts and utilization with cards issued by other financial institutions including american express  bank of america  capital one  chase and citigroup  as well as third party issuers on the discover network and  to a lesser extent  businesses that issue their own private label cards or otherwise extend credit to their customers 
there has been a trend toward consolidation among credit card issuers  leading to greater concentration of resources 
credit card industry participants have increasingly used advertising  targeted marketing  account acquisitions and pricing competition in interest rates  annual fees  reward programs and low priced balance transfer programs to attract and retain cardholders and increase card usage 
in addition  because most domestically issued credit cards  other than those issued on the american express network  are issued on the visa and mastercard networks  most other card issuers benefit from the dominant position and marketing and pricing power of visa and mastercard

risk factors we face competition from other credit card issuers  and we may not be able to compete effectively  which could result in fewer customers and lower account balances and could materially adversely affect our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations and item a 
risk factors we incur considerable expenses in competing with other credit card issuers  and many of our competitors have greater scale  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
in our third party payments business  we compete with other networks for volume and to attract third party issuers to issue credit  debit and prepaid cards on the discover and pulse networks 
diners club and discover network s primary competitors are visa  mastercard and american express  and pulse network s competitors include visa s interlink  star  nyce and maestro 
the former exclusionary rules of visa and mastercard limited our ability to attract merchants and credit and debit card issuers 
in addition  visa and mastercard have entered into long term arrangements with many financial institutions that may have the effect of preventing them from issuing credit or debit cards on the discover or pulse networks 
see item a 
risk factors we face competition from other operators of payment networks  and we may not be able to compete effectively  which could result in reduced transaction volume  limited merchant acceptance of our cards  limited issuance of cards on our network by third parties and materially reduced earnings 
in our deposits business  we compete with other deposit taking organizations  which include banks  credit unions and money market mutual funds 
many financial services firms are increasing their use of deposit funding  including newly formed bank holding companies  and as such we expect increased competition in the deposit markets 
we compete in the deposit markets on the basis of pricing  brand and marketing 
we face challenges in competing with banks with branch locations and those that are expanding their electronic and 
table of contents internet delivery channels 
we cannot predict how any increased competition will affect deposit renewal rates  costs or availability 
see item a 
risk factors an inability to accept or maintain deposits or obtain other sources of funding in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business 
intellectual property we use a variety of methods  such as trademarks  patents  copyrights and trade secrets  to protect our intellectual property 
we also place appropriate restrictions on our proprietary information to control access and prevent unauthorized disclosures 
our discover  pulse and diners club brands are important assets  and we take steps to protect the value of these assets 
however  we may not be able to always successfully protect our intellectual property or proprietary information from misappropriation  infringement or unauthorized disclosure 
in addition  our competitors may obtain intellectual property rights on innovations in our industry 
as a result of these actions  our business could be adversely affected

risk factors the impact on us of recently enacted legislation and government programs to stabilize the financial markets cannot be predicted at this time and item a 
risk factors our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by new regulations to which we are or will become subject as a result of becoming a bank holding company 
permissible activities for a bank holding company include those activities that are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto such as consumer lending and other activities that have been approved by the federal reserve by regulation or order 
certain servicing activities are also permissible for a bank holding company if conducted for or on behalf of the bank holding company or any of its affiliates 
impermissible activities for bank holding companies include activities that are related to commerce such as retail sales of nonfinancial products 
discover has elected to become a financial holding company under glba once it becomes a bank holding company 
the glba removed many of the restrictions on the activities of bank holding companies that become financial holding companies 
a financial holding company  and the non bank companies under its control  are permitted to engage in activities considered financial in nature  incidental to financial activities  or complementary to financial activities if the federal reserve determines that they pose no risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general 
discover s election to become a financial holding company under the glba certifies that the depository institutions discover controls meet certain criteria  including capital  management and community reinvestment act requirements 
if discover were to fail to continue to meet the criteria for financial holding company status  it could  depending on which requirements it failed to meet  face restrictions on new financial activities or acquisitions and or be required to discontinue existing activities that are not generally permissible for bank holding companies 

table of contents federal reserve regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank 
this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations 
banking subsidiaries discover operates two banking subsidiaries in the united states

discover currently is not regulated by the federal reserve as a bank holding company pursuant to a grandfather provision that limits federal reserve oversight of certain companies that meet specific statutory criteria 
discover s grandfathered status would be forfeited and discover would be required to register as a bank holding company if  among other things  discover bank engages in commercial lending at the same time that it accepts demand deposits  or is subject to a change in control under federal banking law or if discover acquires more than five percent of the shares or assets of another bank or savings association  other than in certain limited circumstances 
bank of new castle is a limited purpose credit card bank  chartered and regulated by the delaware commissioner and the fdic  which also insures its deposits 
ownership of bank of new castle does not subject discover to ongoing holding company regulation by the delaware commissioner  and discover is not regulated by the federal reserve as a bank holding company  as long as the activities of bank of new castle are limited to credit card operations

dividends dividends to discover from its subsidiary  discover bank  represent a major source of funds for discover to pay dividends on its stock  make payments on corporate debt securities and meet its other obligations 
there are various federal and state law limitations on the extent to which discover bank can finance or otherwise supply funds to discover through dividends  loans or otherwise 
these limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements  federal and state banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus  and general federal and state regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices 
in general  federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit  without first obtaining regulatory approval  insured depository institutions  such as discover bank  from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards

table of contents fdia the federal deposit insurance act the fdia imposes various requirements on insured depository institutions 
for example  the fdia requires  among other things  the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
the fdia sets forth the following five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation 
at november   discover bank and bank of new castle met all applicable requirements to be deemed well capitalized 
recent regulations proposed by the us bank regulators referred to as the basel ii proposal could alter the capital adequacy framework for participating banking organizations 
discover will continue to closely monitor developments on these matters and assess their impact on discover and its banking subsidiaries 
the fdia also prohibits any depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan 
for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable  among other things  the depository institution s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
each of discover s banking subsidiaries may also be held liable by the fdic for any loss incurred  or reasonably expected to be incurred  due to the default of the other us banking subsidiary and for any assistance provided by the fdic to the other us banking subsidiary that is in danger of default 
the fdia prohibits a bank from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited  unless it is well capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic 
a bank that is adequately capitalized and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market rates 
there are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized 
as of november   discover bank and bank of new castle each met the fdic s definition of a well capitalized institution for purposes of accepting brokered deposits 
an inability to accept brokered deposits in the future could materially adversely impact discover s funding costs and liquidity 
the fdia also affords fdic insured depository institutions  such as discover bank and bank of new castle  the ability to export favorable interest rates permitted under the laws of the state where the bank is located 
discover bank and bank of new castle are both located in delaware and  therefore  charge interest on loans to out of state borrowers at rates permitted under delaware law  regardless of the usury limitations imposed by the state laws of the borrower s residence 
delaware law does not limit the amount of interest that may be charged on loans of the type offered by discover bank or bank of new castle 
this flexibility facilitates the current nationwide lending activities of discover bank and bank of new castle 
investment in discover because discover bank and bank of new castle are each insured depository institutions  certain acquisitions of the voting stock of discover may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under us federal or delaware law 
investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not  directly or indirectly  acquire shares of 
table of contents stock of discover in excess of the amount which can be acquired without regulatory approval under the change in bank control act  the bhca and the delaware change in bank control provisions  which prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of discover without  in most cases  the prior written approval of each of the fdic  the federal reserve and the delaware commissioner 
us credit card regulation the relationship between discover and its us customers is regulated extensively under federal and state consumer protection laws 
federal laws include the truth in lending act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair credit reporting act and the gramm leach bliley act 
moreover  our us banking subsidiaries are subject to the servicemembers civil relief act  which protects persons called to active military service and their dependents from undue hardship resulting from their military service 
the servicemembers civil relief act applies to all debts incurred prior to the commencement of active duty including credit card and other open end debt and limits the amount of interest  including service and renewal charges and any other fees or charges other than bona fide insurance that is related to the obligation or liability 
these and other federal laws  among other things  require disclosures of the cost of credit  provide substantive consumer rights  prohibit discrimination in credit transactions  regulate the use of credit report information  provide financial privacy protections  require safe and sound banking operations and prohibit unfair and deceptive trade practices 
state  and in some cases local  laws also may regulate in these areas as well as provide additional consumer protections 
violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability in litigation by customers  including civil money penalties  actual damages  restitution and attorneys fees 
federal banking regulators  as well as state attorneys general and other state and local consumer protection agencies  also may seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies 
in december  the federal reserve board promulgated final rules amending regulation aa unfair or deceptive acts or practices and regulation z truth in lending act that limit or modify certain credit card practices and require increased disclosures to consumers 
these rules become effective july  we anticipate implementing some of the changes required by the rules prior to the effective date 
the credit card practices addressed by the rules include  but are not limited to  restrictions on the application of rate increases to existing and new balances  payment allocation  default pricing and two cycle billing 
see item a 
risk factors the federal reserve board s amendments to certain rules will significantly impact our business practices and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the th congress  which convened in january  is also expected to consider legislation addressing practices in the credit card industry 
for example  legislation has been introduced to accelerate the effective date of the federal reserve rules described above  and additional requirements could be imposed 
it is not clear at this time whether new limitations on credit card practices or new required disclosures will be adopted by congress or at the state level and  if adopted  what impact any new limitations would have on discover 
see item a 
risk factors changes in laws and regulations  or the application thereof  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
anti money laundering our anti money laundering aml program is coordinated and implemented on an enterprise wide basis 
in the united states  for example  the usa patriot act of imposes significant obligations to deter money laundering and terrorist financing activity  identify customers  report suspicious activity to appropriate authorities  adopt an aml program that includes policies  procedures and internal controls  provide employees with aml training  designate an aml compliance officer and undergo an annual  independent audit to assess the effectiveness of its aml program 
outside the united states  designated types of financial institutions are subject to similar aml requirements 
we have established policies  procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with these aml requirements 

table of contents electronic funds networks we operate the discover and pulse networks  which deliver switching and settlement services to financial institutions and other program participants for a variety of atm  pos and other electronic banking transactions 
these operations are regulated by certain state and federal banking  privacy and data security laws 
moreover  the discover and pulse networks are subject to examination under the oversight of the federal financial institutions examination council  an interagency body composed of the federal bank and thrift regulators  and the national credit union association 
in addition  as our payments business has expanded globally through diners club  we are subject to government regulation in countries in which our networks operate or our cards are used  either directly or indirectly through regulation affecting diners club network licensees 
changes in existing federal  state or international regulation could increase the cost or risk of providing network services  change the competitive environment  or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations 
the legal environment regarding privacy and data security is particularly dynamic  and any disclosure of confidential customer information could have a material adverse impact on our business  including loss of consumer confidence 
us treasury office of foreign assets control we are subject to regulations imposed by the us treasury office of foreign assets control ofac 
ofac restricts financial dealings with identified nations including cuba  iran  myanmar and sudan  as well as financial dealings with certain restricted third parties  such as suspected terrorists or narcotics traffickers 
we have programs in place to minimize the risks of engaging in any prohibited dealings or of our payments networks being used in connection with any prohibited transactions

table of contents item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider each of the following risks described below and all of the other information in this annual report on form k in evaluating us 
our business  financial condition  cash flows and or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
this annual report on form k also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
risks related to the current environment and recent developments the continued economic downturn  recent financial market events and other conditions beyond our control have and could continue to materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition  access to funding and the trading price of our common stock 
the continued economic downturn  recent financial market events and other conditions beyond our control have adversely affected unemployment rates  consumer spending  consumer indebtedness  availability of consumer credit  asset values  investments and liquidity  which in turn adversely affected the ability and willingness of cardmembers to pay amounts owed to us 
this resulted in increased delinquencies and charge offs 
the economic downturn may continue  unemployment may continue to rise  the housing market may continue to be depressed and consumer credit availability may continue to decrease 
the ability and willingness of cardmembers to pay amounts owed to us could continue to be adversely affected  which would increase delinquencies and charge offs and materially adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  with the deterioration in economic conditions  the number of transactions and average purchase amount of transactions on our cards may be reduced  which would reduce transaction fees and interest income and thereby adversely affect profitability 
deterioration in the global capital markets has caused financial institutions to seek additional capital  merge with larger financial institutions and  in some cases  fail 
these conditions have led to concerns by market participants about the stability of financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  resulting in a contraction of available credit  even for the most credit worthy borrowers 
due to recent market events  the securitization markets  historically an important source of funding for us  have not been available to us  and we have shifted to deposits as our primary ongoing funding source 
it is uncertain when  if ever  these markets will return as a source of funding at acceptable rates 
see an inability to accept or maintain deposits or obtain other sources of funding in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business 
recently  the us government has taken certain actions to support the financial markets  including investing in financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets pursuant to the capital purchase program the capital purchase program or the cpp of the us department of the treasury the us treasury  the impact of which we cannot estimate at this time 
in addition  the federal reserve announced the introduction of the term asset backed securities loan facility the talf in an effort to facilitate the issuance of asset backed securities and improve the market conditions for asset backed securities generally 
it is unclear at this time what impact the talf program will have on returning the securitization market to historical capacity and pricing levels 
continued deterioration of the financial markets and continued disruption in the capital markets could materially adversely affect our capital  funding and liquidity position as well as our overall financial condition 
the impact on us of recently enacted legislation and government programs to stabilize the financial markets cannot be predicted at this time 
on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
under eesa  the us treasury has the authority to  among other things  invest in financial institutions for the 
table of contents purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
pursuant to this authority  the us treasury announced its capital purchase program  under which it is purchasing preferred stock and warrants in eligible institutions to increase the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and to support the economy 
on january   we received preliminary approval from the us treasury to participate in the cpp  subject to standard closing conditions 
we expect to issue and sell to the us treasury shares of senior preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the cpp for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion 
there can be no assurance  however  that the us treasury will grant final approval of our application or  if approved  what the size of any investment by the us treasury ultimately will be 
although participation in the cpp would strengthen our capital position  it also would subject us to specific restrictions under the terms of the cpp and increased oversight by the us treasury  regulators and congress under eesa 
participation in the cpp would restrict our ability to increase dividends on our common stock or to repurchase our common stock 
the cpp would also subject us to restrictions on executive compensation practices 
with regard to increased oversight  the us treasury would have the power to unilaterally amend the terms of the purchase agreement to the extent required to comply with changes in applicable federal law and to inspect our corporate books and records through our federal banking regulator 
in addition  the us treasury would have the right to appoint two directors to our board if we miss dividend payments for six dividend periods  whether or not consecutive  on the preferred stock 
congress has held hearings on implementation of the cpp and the use of funds and may adopt further legislation impacting financial institutions that obtain funding under the cpp or changing lending practices that legislators believe led to the current economic situation 
on january   the us house of representatives approved legislation amending the tarp provisions of eesa to include quarterly reporting requirements with respect to lending activities  examinations by an institution s primary federal regulator of use of funds and compliance with program requirements  restrictions on acquisitions by depository institutions receiving tarp funds  and authorization for us treasury to have an observer at board meetings of recipient institutions  among other things 
although it is unclear whether this legislation will be enacted into law  its provisions  or similar ones  may be imposed administratively by the us treasury 
such provisions could restrict our lending or increase governmental oversight of our businesses and our corporate governance practices 
the participation of several of our banking competitors in the cpp and other government programs subjects us to more intense competition 
such competitors are large financial institutions that have received multi billion dollar infusions of capital from the us treasury or other support from federal programs  which has strengthened their balance sheets and increased their ability to withstand the uncertainty of the current economic environment 
the costs of participating or not participating in any such government programs  and the effect on our results of operations  cannot reliably be determined at this time 
in addition  there can be no assurance as to the actual impact that eesa and its implementing regulations  or any other governmental program  will have on the financial markets generally  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced 
the failure of the financial markets to stabilize and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition  access to funding and the trading price of our common stock 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by new regulations to which we are and will become subject as a result of becoming a bank holding company 
on december   we obtained approval from the federal reserve to become a bank holding company 
we will become a bank holding company in connection with participating in the us treasury s capital purchase program  which would require us to meet certain risk based capital and leverage ratio requirements and submit financial and other reports to the federal reserve 
further  we would be subject to organization wide oversight and examination by the federal reserve  including scrutiny of our risk management program  business strategy  earnings  capital and cash flow  anti money laundering program  and examination of our non bank subsidiaries  including discover network  pulse and diners club  and their relationships with 
table of contents our banking subsidiaries 
finally  our business activities would be restricted to those permitted by the federal reserve 
if we fail to satisfy new regulatory requirements applicable to bank holding companies  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the federal reserve board s amendments to certain rules will significantly impact our business practices and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the federal reserve board has adopted amendments to regulation aa unfair or deceptive acts or practices and regulation z truth in lending that place new limitations on certain credit card practices and mandate increased disclosures to consumers including  but not limited to  the following applying rate increases to existing balances 
the amendments prohibit interest rate increases on outstanding balances except under limited circumstances 
applying rate increases to new balances 
the amendments prohibit interest rate increases on new balances during the first year an account is opened except under limited circumstances 
payment allocation 
for accounts with different annual percentage rates aprs on different balances  the amendments require allocation of payments in excess of the required minimum payment either to the higher apr balances first or on a pro rata basis based on the balances 
default pricing 
the amendments restrict imposition of a default apr on existing balances unless an account is days past due 
notice period 
if a rate increase is permitted  the amendments generally require days advance notice be provided to customers prior to imposing the higher rate 
two cycle average daily balance method 
the amendments prohibit the use of the two cycle average daily balance method of calculating interest 
the amendments become effective july  and will impact many of our business practices 
for example  we currently have the ability to increase rates on existing balances to respond to market conditions and consumer behavior 
the amendments will restrict our ability to manage market and credit risk in this manner 
while we anticipate making changes to our pricing  credit and marketing practices that are designed to lessen the impact of these changes  there is no assurance that we will be successful 
if we are not able to lessen the impact of these changes  they will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
risks related to our business we face competition from other credit card issuers  and we may not be able to compete effectively  which could result in fewer customers and lower account balances and could materially adversely affect our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the credit card issuing business is highly competitive 
we compete with other credit card issuers on the basis of a number of factors  including merchant acceptance  products and services  incentives and reward programs  brand  network  reputation and pricing 
this competition affects our ability to obtain applicants for our credit cards  encourage cardmembers to use our credit cards  maximize the revenue generated by card usage and generate cardmember loyalty and satisfaction so as to minimize the number of cardmembers switching to other credit card brands 
competition is also increasingly based on the value provided to the cardholder by rewards programs 
many credit card issuers have instituted rewards programs that are similar to ours  and issuers may in the future institute rewards programs that are more attractive to cardmembers than our programs 
in addition  because most domestically issued credit cards  other than those issued by american express  are issued on the visa and mastercard networks  most other card issuers benefit from the dominant position and marketing and pricing power of visa and mastercard 
if we are unable to compete successfully  or if competing successfully requires us to take aggressive actions in response to competitors actions  our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we incur considerable expenses in competing with other credit card issuers  and many of our competitors have greater scale  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
we incur considerable expenses in competing with other credit card issuers to attract and retain cardmembers and increase card usage 
a substantial portion of these expenses relates to marketing expenditures 
because of the highly competitive nature of the credit card issuing business and increasing marketing challenges  a primary method of competition among credit card issuers  including us  has been to offer low introductory interest rates and balance transfer programs that offer a favorable annual percentage rate or other financial incentives for a specified length of time on account balances transferred from another credit card 
this type of competition has adversely affected credit card yields  and cardholders may frequently switch credit cards or transfer their balances to another card 
there can be no assurance that any of the expenses we incur or incentives we offer to attempt to acquire and maintain accounts and increase card usage will be effective 
furthermore  many of our competitors are larger than we are  have greater financial resources than we do and or have lower capital  funding and operating costs than we have and expect to have  and have assets such as branch locations and co brand relationships that may help them compete more effectively 
in addition  there is an increasing trend toward consolidation among credit card issuers  resulting in even greater pooled resources 
we may be at a competitive disadvantage as a result of the greater scale of many of our competitors 
we face competition from other operators of payment networks  and we may not be able to compete effectively  which could result in reduced transaction volume  limited merchant acceptance of our cards  limited issuance of cards on our networks by third parties and materially reduced earnings 
we face substantial and increasingly intense competition in the payments industry 
we compete with other payment networks to attract third party issuers to issue credit and debit cards and other card products on the discover  pulse and diners club networks 
competition with other operators of payment networks is generally based on issuer interchange fees  switch fees  fees paid to networks  merchant acceptance  network functionality and other economic terms 
competition also is based on customer perception of service quality  brand image  reputation and market share 
many of our competitors are well established  larger than we are and or have greater financial resources than we do 
these competitors have provided financial incentives to card issuers  such as large cash signing bonuses for new programs  funding for and sponsorship of marketing programs and other bonuses 
visa and mastercard each have been in existence for more than years and enjoy greater merchant acceptance and broader global brand recognition than we do 
in addition  visa and mastercard have entered into long term arrangements with many financial institutions that may have the effect of discouraging those institutions from issuing credit cards on the discover network or issuing debit cards on the pulse network 
visa and mastercard also may enact new rules or enforce other rules in the future  including rules that could have the effect of limiting the ability of issuing banks to use the pulse network  which may materially adversely affect our ability to compete 
for example  mastercard recently announced that it will require banks that issue mastercard signature debit cards to also participate in mastercard s affiliated pin debit network 
mastercard and visa completed initial public offerings  which provided them with significant capital and may enhance their strategic flexibility 
american express is also a strong competitor  with international acceptance  high transaction fees and an upscale brand image 
internationally  american express competes in the same market segments as diners club 
furthermore  as a result of their dominant market position and considerable marketing and pricing power  visa and mastercard have been able to increase transaction fees charged to merchants in an effort to retain and grow their issuer volume 
if we are unable to remain competitive on issuer interchange and other incentives  we may be unable to offer adequate pricing to third party issuers while maintaining sufficient net revenues 
at the same time  increasing the transaction fees charged to merchants or increasing acquirer interchange could adversely affect our effort to increase merchant acceptance of credit cards issued on the discover network and may cause merchant acceptance to decrease 
this  in turn  could adversely affect our ability to attract third party issuers and our ability to maintain or grow revenues from our proprietary network 
similarly  the pulse 
table of contents network operates in the highly competitive pin debit business with well established and financially strong network competitors particularly visa that have the ability to offer significant incentives and bundled products to financial institutions 
in addition  if we are unable to maintain sufficient network functionality to be competitive with other networks  or if our competitors develop better data security solutions or more innovative products and services than we do  our ability to attract third party issuers and maintain or increase the revenues generated by our proprietary card issuing business may be materially adversely affected 
an inability to compete effectively with other payment networks could result in reduced transaction volume  limited merchant acceptance of our cards  limited issuance of cards on our network by third parties and materially reduced earnings 
in addition  the deterioration in the capital markets has adversely affected some of our issuers  merchant acquirers and licensees  which are financial institutions 
the failures of financial institutions and increased consolidation in the industry decrease our opportunities for new business and may result in the termination of existing business relationships if a business partner is acquired or goes out of business 
in addition  financial institutions may have decreased interest in engaging in new card issuance opportunities or expanding existing card issuance relationships  which would inhibit our ability to grow our third party payments business 
our business depends on our ability to manage our credit risks  and failing to manage these risks successfully may result in high charge off rates  which would slow our growth and materially adversely affect our business  profitability and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to manage our credit risk while attracting new cardmembers with profitable usage patterns 
we select our cardmembers  manage their accounts and establish terms and credit limits using proprietary scoring models and other analytical techniques that are designed to set terms and credit limits to appropriately compensate us for the credit risk we accept  while encouraging cardmembers to use their available credit 
the models and approaches we use may not accurately predict future charge offs due to  among other things  inaccurate assumptions or models 
while we continually seek to improve our assumptions and models  we may make modifications that unintentionally cause them to be less predictive or incorrectly interpret the data produced by these models in setting our credit policies 
our ability to manage credit risk and avoid high charge off rates may be adversely affected by economic conditions that may be difficult to predict  particularly the continuing deterioration in the consumer credit environment  which we believe has been driven by rising unemployment levels  declining housing prices and restricted availability of credit to consumers 
in anticipation of continued challenging economic conditions  we have increased our provision for loan losses as a result of higher charge offs and owned loan growth and in anticipation of higher future charge off rates 
a greater percent of delinquent accounts are flowing into later stages of delinquency and  based on our experience  will eventually be charged off 
we expect the challenges in the consumer credit environment to continue  leading to increasing delinquency trends and higher charge off rates 
there can be no assurance that our underwriting and portfolio management strategies will permit us to avoid high charge off levels  or that our provision for loan losses will be sufficient to cover actual losses 
a cardmember s ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by increases in their payment obligations to other lenders under mortgage  credit card and other consumer loans 
such changes can result from increases in base lending rates or structured increases in payment obligations  and could reduce the ability of our cardmembers to meet their payment obligations to other lenders and to us 
in addition  a cardmember s ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by the restricted availability of credit to consumers generally  including reduced and closed lines of credit 
cardmembers with insufficient cash flow to fund daily living expenses and lack of access to other sources of credit may be more likely to increase their card usage and ultimately default on their payment obligations to us  resulting in higher credit losses in our portfolio 
our collection operations may not compete effectively to secure more of cardmembers diminished cash flow than our competitors 
in addition  we may not identify cardmembers who are likely to default on their payment obligations to us quickly and reduce our exposure by closing credit lines and restricting authorizations which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our ability to manage credit risk also may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as bankruptcy laws  minimum payment regulations and re age guidance  competitors actions and consumer behavior  as well as inadequate collections staffing  techniques  models and vendor performance 
we plan to expand in several card and consumer lending sectors 
for example  we launched personal loan and student lending products in and expanded our marketing of these products in we also continuously refine and test our credit criteria  which results in some instances in approving applications that did not previously meet our underwriting criteria 
we have less experience in these areas as compared to our traditional products and segments  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our credit risk or generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses in these markets 
our failure to manage our credit risks may materially adversely affect our profitability and ability to grow 
the success of our acquisition of diners club depends upon our ability to maintain the full operability of the diners club network and achieve interoperability among our networks 
if we are unsuccessful in doing so  we may be unable to sustain and grow our international network business 
in  we acquired the diners club network  brand  trademarks  employees  and license agreements 
over the next approximately two years  we are targeting achieving interoperability among the diners club network  the discover network and pulse to allow discover network cardholders to use their cards at merchant and atm locations that accept diners club cards around the world and to allow diners club cardholders to use their cards on the discover network in north america and to access cash through the pulse network 
the success of our acquisition of diners club in the immediate term depends upon our ability to maintain the full operability of the diners club network for existing diners club cardholders  network licensees and merchants 
we rely on existing diners club infrastructure to support diners club network operations and the assistance of citigroup inc during a transition period for certain network and operational support services 
if we were to lose the assistance of key diners club personnel or citigroup inc during the transition  we may face difficulty maintaining operations at the same level 
we rely upon numerous network partners in the united states  canada and the caribbean for merchant acceptance for existing diners club cardholders 
we also rely on the diners club network s current availability of cash access locations for its existing cardholders through mastercard s cirrus atm network  which will terminate on june  if we are unable to continue to offer either acceptable north american merchant acceptance or sufficient cash access locations to existing diners club cardholders  we may experience decreased transaction volume  which would reduce our revenues 
the long term success of our acquisition of diners club depends upon achieving interoperability among our networks  which could include higher overall costs or longer timeframes than anticipated 
if we are unable to successfully achieve interoperability among the networks  we may be unable to achieve the synergies we anticipate and grow our business internationally 
if we are unable to securitize our receivables  it may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  cost of funds  reserves and capital requirements 
historically  we have used the securitization of credit card receivables  which involves the transfer of receivables to a trust and the issuance by the trust of beneficial interests to third party investors  as our largest single source of funding 
due to recent market events and continued disruption in the capital markets  the securitization markets have not been available to us 
our last public asset backed securitization transaction was on june   and our last private asset backed conduit securitization transaction closed on august  our response to the disruptions in the securitization markets has been and we anticipate will continue to be throughout increased utilization of deposit funding 
this shift results in higher levels of owned loan receivables with related increases in the allowance for loan losses  which negatively impacts our earnings 
the shift also increases our regulatory capital requirements and reduces the value of the interest only strip receivable 
additional factors affecting our ability to securitize our credit card receivables include the overall credit quality of our receivables  negative credit ratings action affecting our asset backed securities or discover bank  and the legal  regulatory  accounting and tax requirements governing securitization transactions 
a prolonged inability to securitize our receivables may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  cost of funds  reserves and capital requirements 

table of contents an inability to accept or maintain deposits or obtain other sources of funding in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business 
in response to disruptions in the securitization markets  we have increased and plan to continue to increase our deposit funding 
we obtain deposits through third party securities brokers who offer our deposits to their customers brokered deposits and directly from consumers direct to consumer deposits 
many financial services firms are increasing their use of deposit funding  including newly formed bank holding companies  and as such we expect increased competition in the deposit markets 
we cannot predict how this increased competition will affect deposit renewal rates  costs or availability 
if we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits  our funding costs will be adversely impacted 
in addition  our ability to maintain existing or obtain additional deposits may be impacted by factors beyond our control  including perceptions about our financial strength  which could lead to securities brokers not offering our deposit products to their customers or consumers choosing not to make deposits with us 
our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on capital levels of our bank subsidiaries 
the fdia prohibits a bank  including our subsidiaries discover bank and bank of new castle  from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited  unless it is well capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic 
a bank that is adequately capitalized and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit  including direct to consumer deposits  in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market rates 
there are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized 
while discover bank and bank of new castle each met the fdic s definition of well capitalized as of november   there can be no assurance that they will continue to meet this definition 
an inability to attract or maintain brokered and direct to consumer deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business 
the occurrence of events that result in the early amortization of our existing securitization transactions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our existing securitization transactions 
credit card securitizations are normally structured as revolving transactions that do not distribute to securitization investors their share of monthly principal payments on the receivables during the revolving period  and instead use those principal payments to fund the purchase of replacement receivables 
the occurrence of early amortization events may result in termination of the revolving period of our securitization transactions 
early amortization events include  for example  insufficient cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements also known as excess spread  certain breaches of representations  warranties or covenants in the agreements relating to the securitization and bankruptcy or insolvency 
in the event of an early amortization event  receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trust from us would instead continue to be recognized on our consolidated statements of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trust would instead be used to repay investors in the asset backed securities 
adding these receivables to our balance sheet would require us to record higher reserves for loan losses  which would negatively impact our earnings  increase our regulatory capital requirements  and require us to rely on alternative funding sources  which may or may not be available at the time 
changes to the accounting treatment of securitization transactions could materially adversely affect our financial condition  reserve requirements  capital requirements  liquidity  cost of funds and operations 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued proposed amendments to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  as amended statement no 
and fasb interpretation no 
r  
table of contents consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
exposure drafts for both proposed amendments were issued on september  and each was subject to a day public comment period 
in december  the fasb resumed deliberating the proposed revisions to these two standards and was planning to issue final standards at the end of the first calendar quarter of based on comments it has received and other considerations  the fasb may revise the amendments before issuing final guidance 
currently under statement no 
 the transfers of our credit card receivables in securitization transactions qualify for sale accounting treatment 
the trusts used in our securitizations are not consolidated with the company for financial reporting purposes because the trusts are qualifying special purpose entities qspes under statement no 
because the transfers qualify as sales and the trusts are not subject to consolidation  the assets and liabilities of the trusts are not reported on our balance sheet under gaap 
under the proposed amendment to statement no 
 the concept of a qspe will be eliminated 
qspes will have to be evaluated under fin r for potential consolidation 
if adopted as proposed  the changes to fin r are expected to result in our consolidation of the trusts 
consolidation of the trusts would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for example  if applied as of november   it would require us to add approximately billion of securitized receivables to our assets and add the related debt issued to third party investors to our liabilities 
as a result of the addition of the securitized receivables to our balance sheet  under existing regulatory capital requirements  we would be required to increase capital for discover bank to satisfy regulatory capital requirements 
if discover bank was to fail to meet its regulatory capital requirements  it would become subject to restrictions that could materially adversely affect our ability to conduct normal operations  our liquidity and our cost of funds  such as limiting our ability to issue brokered deposits 
see an inability to accept or maintain deposits or obtain other sources of funding in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business 
in addition  changes to the accounting treatment for securitizations may result in an inability to achieve bankruptcy remote status for the securitization trusts and prevent issuance from the trusts of highly rated investor interests 
we cannot at this time predict the final amendments to statement no 
and fin r or the impact of those amendments  including whether  when and in what form any transfers that currently qualify as sales will be recognized on our balance sheet  what effect the recognition of transfers would have on capital  capital requirements  the ability to maintain a sufficient level of receivables in the trust  or our results of operations  the impact of the amendments on the market for asset backed securities  whether the amendments will cause discover bank to execute fewer securitizations  whether the amendments will trigger the breach of any financial covenants in our credit facility  or what effect the amendments will have on our credit ratings or the credit ratings of debt issued by the trust 
a downgrade in the credit ratings of our securities could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
while we  along with discover bank  have continued to maintain investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies  moody s recently changed its outlook for our credit ratings from stable to negative 
we are regularly evaluated by the ratings agencies  and their ratings for our long term debt and other securities  including asset backed securitizations  are based on a number of factors  including our financial strength as well as factors that may not be within our control 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings or that our credit ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn in their entirety 
the failure to maintain our credit ratings for any reason could materially adversely affect our cost of funds  access to capital and funding  and overall financial condition 
declines in the value of  or income earned from  our retained interests in our securitization transactions could materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we retain interests in the assets transferred to or created in our securitization transactions and earn income from these assets 
the value of our retained interests and the amount of income that we earn depend on many factors  including  among others  the revenues  performance and credit risk of the securitized receivables  which 
table of contents are subject to the same risks and uncertainties as receivables that we have not securitized 
the value of our interests may also change because of changes in the assumptions used to estimate their fair value  such as market interest rates and other conditions  increases in bankruptcy or charge off rates  changes in payment rates and changes in the interpretation and application of accounting rules relating to such valuation 
if the income that we earn from our retained interests in securitization transactions were to decrease or the value of our retained interests were to decrease  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we may not be successful in managing our liquidity and investments  which would adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we must effectively manage liquidity risk to which we are exposed 
liquidity risk is defined as the inability to access cash and cash equivalents needed to meet business requirements and satisfy our obligations 
if we are unsuccessful in managing our liquidity risk  we may maintain too much liquidity  which can be costly and limit financial flexibility  or we may be too illiquid  which could result in financial distress during a liquidity event 
in disorderly financial markets  it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate some of our investments to meet our liquidity needs 
we manage the investments of our liquidity reserve  which had a balance of approximately billion as of november  our investments may be adversely affected by market fluctuations including changes in interest rates  prices  credit risk premiums and overall market liquidity 
also  investments backed by collateral could be adversely impacted by changes in the value of the underlying collateral 
our fixed income investments are subject to market valuation risks from changes in the general level of interest rates 
increases in credit risk premiums can negatively impact the value of our securities 
certain markets have been experiencing disruptions in market liquidity  and the lack of a secondary market may adversely affect the valuation of certain of our investments 
in addition  deteriorating economic conditions may cause certain of the obligors  counterparties and underlying collateral on our investments to incur losses of their own  thereby increasing our credit risk exposure to these investments 
these risks could result in a decrease in the value of our investments  which could negatively impact our financial condition 
for example  for the year ended november   we recorded additional losses on an investment in certain asset backed commercial paper notes purchased in a prior period 
changes in the level of interest rates could materially adversely affect our earnings 
changes in interest rates cause our interest expense to increase or decrease  as certain of our debt instruments carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks 
if we are unable to pass any higher cost of funds to our customers  the increase in interest expense could materially reduce earnings 
some of our managed receivables bear interest at a fixed rate or do not earn interest  and we may not be able to increase the rate on those loans to mitigate any higher cost of funds 
at the same time  our variable rate managed receivables  which are based on a market benchmark  may not change at the same rate as our floating rate borrowings or may be subject to a cap 
for example  during october  the london interbank offered rate libor  which we use as the benchmark for many of our off balance sheet borrowings  increased much more significantly than the prime rate  which we use to determine interest rates on our credit cards that pay variables rates of interest 
consequently  the increased interest expense that we incurred as a result of the increased libor was not met with a similar increase to interest income  thereby resulting in a significant decrease in securitization income during that period 
interest rates may also adversely impact our delinquency and charge off rates 
many consumer lending products bear interest rates that fluctuate with certain base lending rates published in the market  such as the prime rate and libor 
as a result  higher interest rates often lead to higher payment requirements by consumers under obligations to us and other lenders  which may reduce their ability to remain current on their obligations to us and thereby lead to loan delinquencies and additions to our loan loss provision  which could materially adversely affect our earnings 

table of contents we have entered into a credit facility that could restrict our operations 
during  we entered into a multi year unsecured committed credit facility that currently has billion available and contains restrictions  covenants and events of default 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
although we currently have no outstanding balances due under the facility  the terms of the facility impose certain restrictions and future indebtedness may impose various additional restrictions and covenants on us such as tangible net worth requirements that could have adverse consequences  including limiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders  increasing our vulnerability to changing economic  regulatory and industry conditions  limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  limiting our ability to borrow additional funds  and requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other purposes 
we may be unable to increase or sustain discover card usage  which could impair growth in  or lead to diminishing  average balances and total revenue 
a key element of our strategy is to increase the usage of the discover card by our cardmembers  including making it their primary card  and thereby increase our revenue from transaction and service fees and our managed receivables 
however  our cardmembers use and payment patterns may change because of social  legal and economic factors  and cardmembers may decide not to increase card usage or may decide to pay the balances within the grace period to avoid finance charges 
we face challenges from competing credit card products in our attempts to increase credit card usage by our existing cardmembers 
our ability to increase cardmember usage also is dependent on cardmember satisfaction  which may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control  including competitors actions 
as part of our strategy to increase usage  we have been increasing the number of merchants who accept cards issued on the discover network 
if we are unable to continue increasing merchant acceptance of our cards  our ability to grow usage of discover cards may be hampered 
as a result of these factors  we may be unable to increase or sustain credit card usage  which could impair growth in  or lead to diminishing  average balances and total revenue 
we may be unable to grow earnings if we do not attract new cardmembers  or if we attract cardmembers with unfavorable spending and payment habits 
we seek to attract new cardmembers who will use their discover cards  meet their monthly payment obligations and maintain balances that generate interest and fee income for us 
we are subject to substantial competition from other credit card issuers for these new cardmembers 
we may not have adequate financial resources to permit us to incur all of the marketing costs that may be necessary to maintain or grow our managed receivables or to attract new accounts 
the spending and payment habits of these new cardmembers may not be sufficient to make their accounts as profitable as we expect 
in addition  our risk models may not accurately predict the credit risk for these new cardmembers  which could result in unanticipated losses in future periods 
to the extent that the spending and payment habits of new cardmembers do not meet our expectations  our earnings and growth may be negatively affected 
our transaction volume is concentrated among large merchants  and a reduction in the number of  or rates paid by  large merchants that accept cards on the discover network or pulse network could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
discover card transaction volume was concentrated among our top merchants in these merchants may pressure us to reduce our rates by continuing to participate in the discover network only on the condition that we change the terms of their economic participation 
at the same time  we are subject to increasing pricing pressure from third party issuers as a result of the continued consolidation in the banking industry  which results in fewer large issuers that  in turn  generally have a greater ability to negotiate higher interchange fees 
in addition  some of our merchants  primarily our small and mid size merchants  are not contractually committed to us for any period of time and may cease to participate in the discover network at any time on short notice 

table of contents actual and perceived limitations on acceptance of credit cards issued on the discover network could adversely affect the use of the discover card by existing cardmembers and the attractiveness of the discover card to prospective new cardmembers 
we may have difficulty attracting and retaining third party issuers if we are unable to add and retain acquirers or merchants who accept cards issued on the discover or pulse networks 
as a result of these factors  a reduction in the number of  or rates paid by  our merchants could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may be unable to grow earnings if we are unable to increase or maintain the number of small and mid size merchants that participate in the discover network 
since  in order to expand our merchant acceptance among small and mid size merchants  we have been entering into agreements with and have been using third party acquirers and processors to add merchants to the discover network and accept and process payments for these merchants on an integrated basis with visa and mastercard payments 
this strategy could have unanticipated results  such as decreased revenues  higher expenses  degraded service and signage placement levels and retaliatory responses from competitors 
there can be no assurance that the use of third party acquirers and processors will continue to increase merchant acceptance among small or mid size merchants  or that such third party acquirers will continue to participate with us if more attractive opportunities arise 
if we are unable to continue to increase or maintain small and mid size merchant acceptance  our competitive position and our ability to grow earnings could be adversely affected 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the increasing focus of merchants on the fees charged by credit card networks 
merchant acceptance and fees are critical to the success of both our card issuing and payment processing businesses 
merchants are concerned with the fees charged by credit card companies 
they seek to negotiate better pricing or other financial incentives as a condition to continued participation in the discover network 
during the past few years  merchants and their trade groups have filed numerous lawsuits against visa  mastercard  american express and their card issuing banks  claiming that their practices toward merchants  including interchange fees  violate federal antitrust laws 
there can be no assurance that they will not in the future bring legal proceedings against other credit card issuers and networks  including us 
merchants also may promote forms of payment with lower fees  such as pin debit  or seek to impose surcharges at the point of sale for use of credit cards 
the heightened focus by merchants on the fees charged by credit card networks could lead to reduced merchant acceptance of discover network cards or reduced fees  either of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to maintain relationships with the network licensees that issue diners club cards and that maintain a merchant acceptance network  we may be unable to sustain and grow our international network business 
the success of diners club depends upon the cooperation and support of the network licensees that issue diners club cards and that maintain a merchant acceptance network including citigroup  which currently owns and operates network licensees generating over of the diners club network sales volume 
unlike the discover network  we have only a small number of direct merchant relationships in the diners club network 
instead  we rely on network licensees located outside the united states to help us sustain and grow our international business 
as a result of a number of factors  including any difficulties in achieving interoperability among our networks  network licensees may choose not to renew the license agreements with us when their terms expire 
in addition  the increasingly competitive marketplace for cross border issuance and acceptance of credit cards may result in lower participation fees for the diners club network 
in addition  many of the merchants in the acceptance network  primarily small and mid size merchants  may not be contractually committed to the network licensees for any period of time and may cease to participate in the diners club network at any time on short notice 
if we are unable to continue our relationships with network licensees or if the network licensees are unable to continue their relationships with merchants  our ability to maintain or increase revenues and to remain competitive would be adversely affected 

table of contents visa and mastercard may impose additional restrictions on issuing banks  merchants or merchant acquirers that materially adversely affect our networks  or the discover card issuing business 
visa and mastercard aggressively seek to protect their networks from competition and have used their rules and policies to do so 
for example  in the past they enacted and enforced rules that prohibited their member banks from issuing cards on competing payment networks such as discover 
these rules were ultimately found to violate the antitrust laws 
they have adversely affected our business in the past  and they may have lingering effects going forward 
visa and mastercard also may enact new rules or enforce other rules in the future  including limiting the ability of issuing banks to use the pulse network  which may materially adversely affect our ability to compete 
for example  mastercard has recently mandated requiring its signature debit issuing banks also utilize mastercard s affiliated pin debit network 
if fraudulent activity associated with our cards or our networks increases  our brands could suffer reputational damage  the use of our cards could decrease and our fraud losses could be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with merchants  cardmembers and other third parties handling cardmember information 
credit and debit card fraud  identity theft and related crimes are prevalent and perpetrators are growing ever more sophisticated 
our financial condition  the level of our fraud charge offs and other results of operations could be materially adversely affected if fraudulent activity were to significantly increase 
in addition  significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention such as mandatory card reissuance and reputational and financial damage to our brands  which could negatively impact the use of our cards and networks and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business 
fraudulent activity may result in lower license fee revenue from our diners club licensees 
if our security systems  or those of merchants  merchant acquirers or other third parties containing information about cardholders  are compromised  we may be subject to liability and damage to our reputation 
our security protection measures or the security protections of third parties participating in the discover or pulse networks may not be sufficient to protect the confidentiality of information relating to cardholders or transactions processed on the discover or pulse networks 
cardholder data also may be stored on systems of third party service providers and merchants that may have inadequate security systems 
third party carriers regularly transport cardholder data  and may lose sensitive cardholder information 
unauthorized access to the discover or pulse networks or any other discover information systems potentially could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems or transmitted by our cardmembers or others 
if our security systems or those of merchants  processors or other third party service providers are compromised such that this confidential information is disclosed to unauthorized parties  we may be subject to liability 
the preventive measures we take to address these factors are costly  and may become more costly in the future 
moreover  these measures may not protect us from liability  which may not be adequately covered by insurance  or from damage to our reputation 
the financial services and payment services industries are rapidly evolving  and we may be unsuccessful in introducing new products or services in response to this evolution 
the financial services and payment services industries experience constant and significant technological changes  such as continuing development of technologies in the areas of smart cards  radio frequency and proximity payment devices  electronic commerce and mobile commerce  among others 
the effect of technological changes on our business is unpredictable 
we depend  in part  on third parties for the development of and access to new technologies 
we expect that new services and technologies relating to the payments business will continue to appear in the market  and these new services and technologies may be superior to  or render obsolete  the technologies that we currently use in our card products and services 
as a result  our future success may be dependent on our ability to identify and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards and to provide payment solutions for our cardmembers  merchants and financial institution customers 

table of contents difficulties or delays in the development  production  testing and marketing of new products or services may be caused by a number of factors including  among other things  operational  capital and regulatory constraints 
the occurrence of such difficulties may affect the success of our products or services  and developing unsuccessful products and services could result in financial losses  as well as decreased capital availability 
in addition  the new products and services offered may not be attractive to our cardmembers and merchant and financial institution customers 
if key technology platforms such as our transaction authorization and settlement systems become obsolete  or if we encounter difficulties processing transactions efficiently or at all  our revenue or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we have a large technology staff utilizing current technology 
there is no assurance that we may be able to sustain our investment in new technology to avoid obsolescence of critical systems and applications 
further  our transaction authorization and settlement systems  and our clearing system for transactions between diners club network licensees  may encounter service interruptions due to system or software failure  fire  natural disasters  power loss  disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access  terrorism or accident 
some of our transaction processing systems are operated at a single facility and could be subject to service interruptions in the event of failure 
our services could be disrupted by a natural disaster or other problem at any of our primary or back up facilities or our other owned or leased facilities 
we also depend on third party service providers for the timely transmission of information across our data transportation network and for other telecommunications and technology related services  including ancillary transaction processing services for the pulse network and clearing services for the diners club network 
regardless of whether as a result of natural disaster  operational disruption  terrorism  termination of its relationship with us  or any other reason  if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or deliver services that we require or expect  the failure could interrupt our services and operations and hamper our ability to process cardholders transactions in a timely and accurate manner or to maintain thorough and accurate records of those transactions 
such a failure could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our networks and the quality of our brands  and could materially adversely affect our revenues or results of operations 
merchant defaults may adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
as an issuer and merchant acquirer in the united states on the discover network  and as a holder of certain merchant agreements internationally for the diners club network  we may be contingently liable for certain disputed credit card sales transactions that arise between cardholders and merchants 
if a dispute is resolved in the cardholder s favor  we will cause a credit or refund of the amount to be issued to the cardholder and charge back the transaction to the merchant or merchant acquirer 
if we are unable to collect this amount from the merchant or a merchant acquirer  we will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder 
where the purchased product or service is not provided until some later date following the purchase  such as an airline ticket  the likelihood of potential liability increases 
our success is dependent  in part  upon our executive officers and other key personnel  and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 
our success depends  in part  on our executive officers and other key personnel 
our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace 
our senior management team is relatively small and we believe we are in a critical period of competition in the financial services and payments industry 
the market for qualified individuals is highly competitive  and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel 
the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

table of contents we may be unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property  including our brands 
the discover  pulse and diners club brands are very important assets  and our success is dependent on our ability to protect these and our other intellectual property 
we may not be able to successfully protect our intellectual property 
if others misappropriate  use or otherwise diminish the value of our intellectual property  our business could be adversely affected 
usage by consumers of credit sources such as home equity loans and mortgage refinancings instead of credit card borrowings could adversely affect our business 
home equity loans  mortgage refinancings and other options for consumer credit compete with our card products as alternative sources for consumer borrowing  as consumers may finance expenditures or refinance account balances with these alternative sources of credit 
increased usage by consumers of such alternative sources of credit could adversely affect our businesses 
acquisitions that we pursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 
we may consider or undertake strategic acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
if we do so  we may not be able to successfully finance or integrate any such businesses  products or technologies 
in addition  the integration of any acquisition may divert management s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations 
we may allocate resources  such as time and money  on projects that do not increase our earnings 
to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash  it would reduce our cash balances  similarly  if the purchase price is paid with our stock  it could be dilutive to our stockholders 
we are subject to regulation by a number of different regulatory agencies  which have broad discretion to require us to alter our operations in ways that could adversely affect our business or subject us to penalties for noncompliance 
we must comply with an array of banking and consumer lending laws and regulations in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are subject to regulation and regular examinations by the fdic and the delaware bank commissioner 
if we become a bank holding company  we will be subject to oversight  regulation and examination by the federal reserve 
in addition  we are subject to regulation by the federal trade commission  state banking regulators and the doj  as well as the sec and new york stock exchange nyse in our capacity as a public company 
in addition  as our payments business has expanded globally through the acquisition of diners club  we are subject to government regulation in countries in which our networks operate or our cards are used  either directly or indirectly through regulation affecting diners club network licensees 
from time to time  these regulations and regulatory agencies have required us to alter certain of our operating practices  and may require us to do the same in the future 
our ability to introduce new products or introduce new pricing may be impaired or delayed as a result of regulatory review or failure to obtain required regulatory approvals 
we conduct our business primarily through our banks  and various federal and state regulators have broad discretion to impose restrictions on our operations 
us federal and state consumer protection laws and rules  and laws and rules of foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business limit the manner and terms on which we may offer and extend credit 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to adverse consequences such as financial  structural  reputational and operational penalties  including receivership  litigation exposure and fines 
in addition  efforts to abide by these laws and regulations may increase our costs of operations or limit our ability to engage in certain business activities  including affecting our ability to generate or collect receivables from cardmembers 
changes in laws and regulations  or the application thereof  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the financial services industry  in general  is heavily regulated 
proposals for legislation further regulating the financial services industry are continually being introduced in the united states congress and in state legislatures 
congress is expected to consider legislation in to restructure the regulation of financial services providers 
president obama has included legislative proposals affecting credit card lending in his administration s legislative 
table of contents agenda 
the agencies regulating the financial services industry also periodically adopt changes to their regulations 
in light of current conditions in the us financial markets and economy  regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry 
we are unable to predict whether any of these proposals will be implemented or in what form  or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations  including the interpretation or implementation thereof  will occur in the future 
any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see the impact on us of recently enacted legislation and government programs to stabilize the financial markets cannot be predicted at this time 
the credit card industry is also becoming more heavily regulated 
the federal reserve board has adopted amendments to regulation aa unfair or deceptive acts or practices and regulation z truth in lending that place new limitations on certain credit card practices and mandate increased disclosures to consumers 
see the federal reserve board s amendments to certain rules will significantly impact our business practices and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in  congress is expected to consider legislation to restrict certain practices in the credit card industry  including those relating to grace periods  the two cycle balance computation method  risk based and default based interest rate changes  the allocation of payments  use of arbitration agreements and fees 
it is not clear at this time whether new limitations on credit card practices will be adopted by congress or at the state level and  if adopted  what impact such new limitations would have on us 
in addition  the laws governing bankruptcy  debtor relief and debt collection in the united states could also change  making it more expensive or more difficult for us to collect from our cardmembers 
for example  there is considerable support in congress for authorizing bankruptcy judges to modify the terms of first mortgages  and some interest in repealing provisions of the bankruptcy reform law that have been perceived as making it more difficult for debtors to obtain chapter debt discharges 
such changes could increase the attractiveness of bankruptcy relief and increase bankruptcy related losses 
this year  congress is expected to consider legislation to regulate the assessment of interchange fees by dominant credit card networks  which would  at least indirectly  impact our ability to set these fees 
furthermore  various federal and state agencies and standard setting bodies may  from time to time  enact new or amend existing accounting rules or standards that could impact our business practices or funding transactions 
regulation of the payments industry  including regulation applicable to discover card  merchant acquirers and our other business partners and customers  has expanded significantly in recent years 
for instance  financial institutions  including us  were required to implement an enhanced anti money laundering program in pursuant to the usa patriot act 
various us federal and state regulatory agencies and state legislatures are considering new legislation or regulations relating to credit card pricing and repricing  use of consumer reports  credit card disclosures  patent reform  identity theft  privacy  data security and marketing that could have a direct effect on us and our merchant and financial institution customers 
in addition  the payments industry is the subject of increasing global regulatory focus  which may result in costly new compliance burdens being imposed on us and our cardholders and lead to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues 
we  our diners club licensees and diners club cardholders are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in many countries in which our cards are used 
current and proposed regulation addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could inhibit the number of payment cards issued and increase our costs 
regulatory pronouncements relating to consumer privacy  data use and security affect our business 
in the united states  we are subject to the federal trade commission s and the banking regulators information safeguard rules under the gramm leach bliley act 
the rules require that financial institutions including us develop  implement and maintain a written  comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution s size and complexity  the nature and scope of the financial institution s activities  and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue 
the united states has experienced a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security  including requiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach 
in the united states  there are a number of bills pending in congress 
table of contents and in individual states  and there have been numerous legislative hearings focusing on these issues 
in addition  most states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of certain types of security breaches  and several other states are considering similar legislation 
regulation of privacy  data use and security may cause an increase in the costs to issue payment cards and or may decrease the number of our cards that we or third parties issue 
new regulations in these areas may also increase our costs to comply with such regulations  which could materially adversely affect our earnings 
in addition  failure to comply with the privacy and data use and security laws and regulations to which we are subject  including by reason of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information  could result in fines  sanctions  penalties or other adverse consequences and loss of consumer confidence  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  overall business and reputation 
legislation or regulation could be enacted requiring us to hold higher levels of capital  which we may not be able to obtain and which would reduce our return on capital 
we are subject to capital  funding and liquidity requirements prescribed by statutes  regulations and orders 
new legislation or regulations could increase the levels of regulatory capital that are required 
regulators already have broad discretion to impose additional capital and other requirements on us  including imposing restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends 
our ability to obtain additional capital would be dependent upon  among other things  general economic conditions  our financial performance and prospects 
if we were required to increase capital levels for discover financial services  it would have the effect of reducing our return on capital 
in addition  if discover bank and bank of new castle were to fail to meet these regulatory capital requirements  they would become subject to restrictions that could materially adversely affect our ability to conduct normal operations 
litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines  penalties and or requirements resulting in increased expenses 
businesses in the credit card industry have historically been subject to significant legal actions  including class action lawsuits and patent claims 
many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages 
while we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with cardmembers to limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future 
in addition  we may be involved in various actions or proceedings brought by governmental regulatory agencies in the event of noncompliance with laws or regulations  which could subject us to significant fines  penalties or other requirements resulting in increased expenses 
risks related to our spin off certain of our historical financial results are as a business segment of morgan stanley and therefore may not be representative of our results as a separate  stand alone company 
certain historical financial information we have included in this filing has been derived from morgan stanley s consolidated financial statements and does not necessarily reflect what our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows would have been had we operated as a separate  stand alone company during the periods presented 
for example  our funding costs increased after our separation from morgan stanley 
in addition  certain historical costs and expenses reflected in our audited consolidated and combined financial statements include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by morgan stanley  including general corporate expenses  employee benefits and incentives 
these allocations were based on what we and morgan stanley considered to be reasonable reflections of the historical utilization levels of these services required in support of our business 
this historical information does not necessarily indicate what our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows or costs and expenses would have been had we operated as a separate  stand alone entity  nor is it indicative of what our results will be in the future 

table of contents we must abide by certain restrictions to preserve the tax treatment of the distribution of our common stock by morgan stanley and we must indemnify morgan stanley for taxes resulting from certain actions we take that cause the distribution to fail to qualify as a tax free transaction 
morgan stanley has received a ruling from the internal revenue service that  based on certain representations and qualifications  the distribution of our common stock by morgan stanley was tax free to morgan stanley stockholders for us federal income tax purposes 
these representations include satisfaction of certain requirements that must be met in order for the distribution to qualify for tax free treatment under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  and state law 
if any of the representations and assumptions upon which the ruling is based is untrue or incomplete in any material respect  morgan stanley may not be able to rely upon the ruling 
if the distribution were not to qualify for tax free treatment under sections  and related provisions of the code  morgan stanley would recognize taxable gain equal to the excess of the fair market value of our stock over morgan stanley s tax basis in our stock 
under certain circumstances  we would be required under the us tax sharing agreement entered into between morgan stanley and us to indemnify morgan stanley for all or a portion of this liability 
in addition  each holder who received our common stock in the distribution would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock received 
even if the distribution initially qualifies as a tax free distribution under the code  current tax law generally creates a presumption that the distribution would be taxable to morgan stanley but not to its stockholders if we engage in  or enter into an agreement to engage in  a transaction that would result in a or greater change  by vote or by value  in our stock ownership during the four year period beginning on the date that begins two years before the distribution date  unless it is established that the transaction is not pursuant to a plan or series of transactions related to the distribution 
under the us tax sharing agreement entered into between morgan stanley and us  for a period of two years following the distribution  we may not take certain actions unless morgan stanley provides us with prior written consent for such action  or we provide morgan stanley with a tax ruling or rulings  or an unqualified opinion of counsel  in each case acceptable to morgan stanley  to the effect that the action will not affect the tax free nature of the separation and distribution 
these restrictions may prevent us from entering into strategic or other transactions which might be advantageous to us or to our stockholders  such as issuing equity securities to satisfy our financing needs  acquiring businesses or assets by issuing equity securities  or mergers or other business combinations

item properties our principal properties are located throughout seven states in the united states 
as of january   we owned five principal properties  which included our corporate headquarters  two call centers and two processing centers  and we leased three principal properties  which included two call centers and our pulse headquarters 
the call centers and processing centers largely support the us card segment  the pulse headquarters is used by our third party payments segment and our corporate headquarters is used by both our u

all of our call centers and processing centers are operating at and being utilized to a reasonable capacity

item legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we have been named  from time to time  as a defendant in various legal actions  including arbitrations  class actions  and other litigation  arising in connection with our activities 
certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages 
we have historically relied on the arbitration clause in our cardmember agreements  which has limited the costs of  and our exposure to  litigation 
we are also involved  from time to time  in other reviews  investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental agencies regarding our business  including  among other matters  accounting and operational matters  some of which may result in adverse judgments  settlements  fines  penalties  injunctions  or other relief 
litigation and regulatory actions could also adversely affect our reputation 
we contest liability and or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter 
in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters  particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages  we cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss  if any  related to such matters  how such matters will be resolved  when they will ultimately be resolved  or what the eventual settlement  fine  penalty or other relief  if any  might be 
subject to the foregoing  we believe  based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel  that the outcome of the pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  although the outcome of such matters could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular future period  depending on  among other things  our level of income for such period 

table of contents we filed a lawsuit captioned discover financial services  inc v 
visa usa inc  mastercard inc 
et al 
in the us district court for the southern district of new york on october  through this lawsuit we sought to recover substantial damages and other appropriate relief in connection with visa s and mastercard s illegal anticompetitive practices that  among other things  foreclosed us from the credit and debit network services markets 
the lawsuit followed the us supreme court s october denial of visa s and mastercard s petition for review of the decision of the us court of appeals affirming a lower court decision in a case brought by the us department of justice in which the court found that visa s and mastercard s exclusionary rules violated the antitrust laws and harmed competition and consumers by foreclosing us from offering credit and debit network services to banks 
during the third quarter of  the court issued rulings on the parties motions for summary judgment 
among other things  the court s rulings precluded visa and mastercard from relitigating elements of our core claim that were already decided in the us department of justice lawsuit and otherwise limited the remaining issues for trial  which was scheduled for october  we reached an agreement in principle to settle the lawsuit with mastercard and visa on october   and executed a settlement agreement on october  the agreement became effective on november  upon receipt of the approval of visa s class b shareholders 
under the settlement  visa and mastercard agreed to pay us up to billion in exchange for our agreement to dismiss the lawsuit and release all claims 
mastercard agreed to pay us a lump sum in the amount of million  which we received in the fourth quarter 
visa agreed to pay us up to an aggregate amount of approximately billion  in four installments of up to million each on december   march   june  and september   plus interest 
the payments from visa are contingent on the company achieving certain financial performance measures 
for each of the first three fiscal quarters in  visa agreed to pay us an amount equal to of each quarter s total combined transaction sales volume for company payment cards  including payment cards issued by the company and payment cards issued by third parties on the discover  pulse and diners club networks  up to the maximum amount for each quarter stated above 
for the fourth payment  which covers a three week period in the fourth fiscal quarter of  visa agreed to pay us an amount equal to of the period s total combined transaction sales volume  up to the maximum quarterly payment amount stated above 
the settlement agreement provides for adjustments to the maximum amounts and for other adjustments based on whether we achieve the financial performance measures 
on december   we received a quarterly payment from visa in the amount of million 
at the time of our spin off from morgan stanley  we entered into an agreement with morgan stanley regarding the manner in which the antitrust case against visa and mastercard was to be pursued and settled and how proceeds of the litigation were to be shared the special dividend agreement 
as previously disclosed  the agreement provided that  upon resolution of the litigation  after expenses  we would be required to pay morgan stanley the first million of value of cash or non cash proceeds increased at the rate of per annum until paid in full the minimum proceeds  plus of any proceeds in excess of billion  subject to certain limitations and a maximum potential payment to morgan stanley of billion 
all payments by us to morgan stanley would be net of taxes payable by us with respect to such proceeds 
on october   morgan stanley filed a lawsuit against us in new york supreme court for new york county seeking a declaration that morgan stanley did not breach the special dividend agreement  did not interfere with any of our existing or prospective agreements for resolution of the antitrust case against visa and mastercard and that morgan stanley is entitled to receive a portion of the settlement proceeds as set forth in the special dividend agreement 
on november   we filed our response to morgan stanley s lawsuit  which includes counterclaims against morgan stanley for interference with our efforts to resolve the antitrust lawsuit against visa and mastercard and willful and material breach of the special dividend agreement  which expressly provided that we would have sole control over the investigation  prosecution and resolution of the antitrust lawsuit 
through our counterclaims we seek a ruling that because of morgan stanley s willful  material breach of the special dividend agreement it has no right to any of the proceeds from the settlement 
we have also requested damages in an amount to be proven at trial 

table of contents other matters on october   the antitrust division of the united states department of justice the division issued a civil investigative demand cid to the company seeking information regarding an investigation related to potential violations of section of the sherman act  usc the cid seeks documents  data and narrative responses to several interrogatories and document requests  which focus on certain payment card network rules relating to merchant acceptance practices  including those that apply to merchants ability to steer customers to payment forms preferred by merchants 
a cid is a request for information in the course of a civil investigation and does not constitute the commencement of legal proceedings 
the division is permitted by statute to issue a cid to anyone whom it believes may have information relevant to an investigation 
the receipt of a cid does not presuppose that there is probable cause to believe that a violation of the antitrust laws has occurred or that a formal complaint ultimately will be filed 
we are cooperating with the division in connection with the cid

some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis constitutes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k particularly under special note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 
unless otherwise specified  references to notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements are to the notes to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements as of november  and and for the three year period ended november  introduction and overview discover financial services is a leading credit card issuer and electronic payment services company 
we offer credit cards as well as other financial products and services to qualified customers 
we are also a leader in payment processing and related services for merchants and financial institutions 
our fiscal year ends on november of each year 
our primary revenues come from interest income earned on loan receivables  securitization income derived from the transfer of credit card loan receivables to securitization trusts and subsequent issuance of beneficial interests through securitization transactions  and fees earned from cardmembers  merchants and issuers 
the primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs interest expense  loan loss provision  cardmember rewards  and expenses incurred to grow  manage and service our loan receivables 
our business activities are funded primarily through the process of asset securitization  the raising of consumer deposits  and both secured and unsecured debt 
in a credit card securitization  loan receivables are first transferred to the securitization trust  from which beneficial interests are issued to investors 
we continue to own and service the accounts that generate the securitized loans 
the trusts utilized by us to facilitate asset securitization transactions are not our subsidiaries 
these trusts are excluded from our consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
because our securitization activities qualify as sales under gaap and accordingly are not treated as secured financing transactions  we remove credit card loan receivables equal to the amount of the investor interests in securitized loans from our consolidated statements of financial condition 
as a result  asset securitizations have a significant effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements in that the portions of interest income  provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our consolidated and combined statements of income  however  they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions 
see accounting treatment for off balance sheet securitizations below for information regarding proposed amendments to the accounting standards applicable to asset securitizations and see outlook below for a discussion of the current state of the securitization markets 
our senior management evaluates business performance and allocates resources using financial data that is presented on a managed basis 
managed loans consist of our on balance sheet loan portfolio  loans held for sale and loan receivables that have been securitized and against which beneficial interests have been issued

table of contents highlights the consumer credit environment continues to be challenging 
for the year ended november   the managed charge off rate was compared to for the year ended november  and as of november   the managed over days delinquency rate was  up from as of november  as a result  we have increased our reserve rate to as of november  compared to as of november  during  there were significant disruptions in the capital markets 
throughout the year  issuance capacity in the credit card securitization markets became increasingly constrained and was unavailable in the fourth quarter 
as a result  our on balance sheet credit card loans have grown during the period and we have recorded a reserve for loan losses on those loans 
in order to finance these additional receivables  we have increased our deposit funding 
additionally  in response to the disruptions in the capital markets  we have increased our contingent liquidity reserve to billion at november   up from billion at november  market interest rates were highly volatile  but generally declined during the year 
as a result  we had a lower cost of funds which positively impacted pretax income as maturing deposits were replaced with new deposits issued at lower interest rates 
in addition  our securitization income was favorably impacted by lower interest expense on outstanding securitizations 
while the declining interest rate environment also adversely impacted interest income earned on our floating rate assets  we sought to mitigate this impact by reducing new promotional rate balance transfer activity and offering new loans at fixed rates 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and through much of  the relationship between the federal funds rate which impacts the prime rate  the rate to which our floating rate credit card receivables are benchmarked and the london interbank offered rate libor  the rate to which our securitization borrowings are benchmarked widened in response to disruptions in the capital markets with libor often remaining significantly higher than the federal funds rate 
as a result  at various times in  our securitization income was negatively impacted by a higher libor 
also in  asset backed commercial paper rates rose 
in  we settled our antitrust litigation with visa and mastercard for billion 
in the fourth quarter  we received an million payment from mastercard as payment in full of its portion of the settlement  which we recorded in other income in the us card segment 
in  we expect to earn the remaining amount in four quarterly payments of up to million each from visa 
we entered into an agreement with morgan stanley at the time of our spin off to give us sole control over the prosecution and settlement of the litigation and to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared 
we have notified morgan stanley that it breached the agreement and the amount due to morgan stanley  if any  is a matter of dispute 
the dispute is a subject of litigation between the parties 
see item legal proceedings 
on june   we acquired diners club international diners club for million 
the diners club network has network licensees that issue diners club cards and that maintain an acceptance network in countries and territories 
results of the diners club business since the acquisition are reflected in our third party payments segment 
during the year  we had strong transaction volume in our third party payments segment in comparison to transaction volume in this segment increased over the prior year to billion  including a billion volume contribution from diners club 
we sold our uk credit card business goldfish to barclays bank plc on march  this business represented substantially all of our international card segment  which is presented in discontinued operations in this report 

table of contents and highlights on june   we spun off from morgan stanley through the distribution of shares of our common stock to holders of morgan stanley common stock the distribution 
our results of operations for the year ended november  include costs incurred as a result of the distribution of approximately million  including costs that were allocated to the international card segment  reported as discontinued operations in this report 
in  market interest rates trended upward and remained stable throughout most of and the relationship between the federal funds rate and libor also remained stable during most of the period 
however  during the fourth quarter of  the relationship between the federal funds rate and libor changed materially  with libor often remaining significantly higher than the federal funds rate 
leading up to october  when new us bankruptcy legislation became effective  we experienced a surge in bankruptcy receipts  with receipts peaking in october in  we experienced a dramatic decline in bankruptcy receipts  which benefited our financial results 
bankruptcy levels rose from the level in and outlook our financial results continue to be adversely impacted by the challenging economic environment 
we believe that rising unemployment levels  declining housing prices and restricted availability of credit to consumers have contributed to higher overall industry delinquency and charge off rates 
we expect to continue to operate in a difficult environment in we recorded higher provision for loan losses this year as a result of higher charge offs and owned loan growth and in anticipation of higher future charge offs 
we have been experiencing a trend of a greater percent of delinquent accounts flowing into later stages of delinquency and eventually into charge off 
our underwriting and portfolio management strategies and geographic diversification are designed to manage exposure to credit losses 
however  the continued challenges in the consumer credit environment are likely to lead to increasingly higher charge off rates in disruptions in the capital markets  which have caused financial institutions to seek additional capital  merge with larger financial institutions and  in some cases  fail  have caused market participants to be concerned about the stability of financial markets generally  the strength of counterparties and extending credit 
due to these disruptions  we did not enter into an asset backed securitization transaction in the fourth quarter of our last public asset backed securitization transaction was on june   and our last private asset backed conduit securitization transaction closed on august  it is difficult to predict if or when securitization markets will return to historical capacity and pricing levels 
in november  the federal reserve announced the introduction of the term asset backed securities loan facility the talf in an effort to facilitate the issuance of asset backed securities and improve the market conditions for asset backed securities 
it is unclear at this time what impact the talf program will have on returning the credit card securitization market to historical capacity and pricing levels 
we have approximately billion in asset backed securities maturing during  of which billion will mature in the first quarter of  and billion in asset backed securities maturing during as the downturn in execution levels in the capital markets is expected to continue  we anticipate that all of the maturities will be funded with deposits  as was done in the fourth quarter of this shift will result in higher levels of owned loan receivables with related increases in the allowance for loan losses and a reduction in the size of the interest only strip receivable 
we obtain deposits through the brokered deposit market  in which third party securities brokers offer our certificates of deposit to their customers  and through the direct to consumer deposit market  in which we offer our deposit products directly to consumers 
as of november   we had total deposits of billion 
in 
table of contents  we expect to increase our direct to consumer deposit business significantly 
although we believe that we can meet all of our funding needs in with deposits  competition in deposit markets may increase due to the current disruption in the capital markets 
we cannot predict how an increase in competition will affect deposit renewal rates  costs or availability 
our priorities in include continuing to grow merchant acceptance in the united states and enhancing our global payments business 
our payments business grew its transaction volume this year  which we expect to continue throughout  as this business continues to benefit from new and existing relationships with financial institutions 
we will seek to accelerate our growth in third party network volume through signing additional third party issuers and through marketing programs with both our domestic third party issuers and global diners club network licensees 
over approximately the next two years  we expect to achieve interoperability between the diners club network and the discover network  which will allow discover network cardholders to use their cards at merchant and atm locations that accept diners club cards around the world  and diners club cardholders to use their cards on the discover network in north america 
we also expect to achieve interoperability between the diners club network and the pulse network to allow diners club cardholders to access cash through the pulse network 
in  we anticipate receiving significant benefits from the remaining payments from the settlement of our antitrust litigation with visa and mastercard  expected to be million per quarter 
we expect the proceeds will strengthen our capital base during this period of economic uncertainty and intend to use a portion of the settlement proceeds to invest in growing our business 
us treasury capital purchase program on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
under eesa  the us department of the treasury the us treasury has the authority to  among other things  invest in financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
pursuant to this authority  the us treasury announced its troubled asset relief program tarp capital purchase program cpp  under which it is purchasing senior preferred stock and warrants in eligible institutions to increase the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and to support the economy 
we are seeking to participate in the cpp for additional capital to support our consumer lending operations and other businesses 
on january   we received preliminary approval from the us treasury to participate in the cpp  subject to standard closing conditions 
we expect to issue and sell to the us treasury shares of senior preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the cpp for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion 
there can be no assurance  however  that the u 
s treasury will grant final approval of our application or  if approved  what the size of any investment by the u 
s treasury ultimately will be 
the senior preferred stock would qualify as tier capital and would pay a cumulative dividend rate of five percent per annum for the first five years and a rate of nine percent per annum after year five 
the senior preferred stock would be non voting  other than class voting rights on certain matters that could amend the rights of or adversely affect the stock 
the senior preferred stock would be redeemable after three years with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency 
prior to the end of three years  the senior preferred stock may be redeemed with the proceeds from a qualifying equity offering of any tier perpetual preferred or common stock resulting in proceeds of not less than percent of the issue price of the senior preferred stock 
the us treasury may also transfer the senior preferred stock to a third party at any time 
participation in the cpp would restrict our ability to increase dividends on our common stock or to repurchase our common stock until three years have elapsed  unless i all of the senior preferred stock issued to the u 
s treasury is redeemed  ii all of the senior preferred stock issued to the u 
s treasury has been transferred to third parties  or iii we receive the consent of the us treasury 
in conjunction with the purchase of senior preferred stock  the us treasury would receive warrants to purchase a number of shares of common stock with an aggregate market price equal to percent of the senior preferred investment 
the exercise price on the warrants would be the market price of our common stock  calculated on a trading day trailing average 

table of contents participation in the cpp would also require us to adopt the us treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the us treasury holds equity issued under the cpp 
these standards generally apply to the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  plus the three most highly compensated executive officers 
in addition  we would be required to agree not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of  for each senior executive 
in addition  we expect that participation in the cpp would subject us to increased oversight by the us treasury  regulators and congress 
under the terms of the cpp  the us treasury would have the power to unilaterally amend the terms of the purchase agreement to the extent required to comply with changes in applicable federal law and to inspect our corporate books and records through our federal banking regulator 
in addition  the us treasury would have the right to appoint two directors to our board if we missed dividend payments for six dividend periods  whether or not consecutive  on the preferred stock 
congress has held hearings on implementation of tarp 
on january   the us house of representatives approved legislation amending the tarp provisions of eesa to include quarterly reporting requirements with respect to lending activities  examinations by an institution s primary federal regulator of use of funds and compliance with program requirements  restrictions on acquisitions by depository institutions receiving tarp funds  and authorization for us treasury to have an observer at board meetings of recipient institutions  among other things 
although it is unclear whether this legislation will be enacted into law  its provisions  or similar ones  may be imposed administratively by the us treasury 
in addition  congress may adopt other legislation impacting financial institutions that obtain funding under the cpp or changing lending practices that legislators believe led to the current economic situation 
such provisions could restrict or require changes to our lending or governance practices or increase governmental oversight of our businesses 
see item business supervision and regulation and item a 
risk factors the impact on us of recently enacted legislation and government programs to stabilize the financial markets cannot be predicted at this time 
in connection with participating in the cpp  we would become a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of and a financial holding company under the gramm leach bliley act 
our application to become a bank holding company was approved by the us federal reserve on december  registration as a bank holding company would subject us to new legal and regulatory requirements  including minimum capital requirements  and would subject us to oversight  regulation and examination by the federal reserve

accounting treatment for off balance sheet securitizations the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued proposed amendments to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  as amended statement no 
 and fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
under the proposed amendment to statement no 
 the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe will be eliminated 
qspes are currently exempt from the consolidation provisions of fin r  and as a result  amendments to that standard are being considered as well 
exposure drafts for proposed amendments to each standard were issued on september   and each was subject to a day public comment period 
based on comments it received and other considerations  the fasb may revise the amendments before issuing final guidance 
the changes to these standards  if adopted as proposed  may make it more difficult for us to maintain or establish sale accounting treatment in connection with transfers of financial assets in securitization transactions and could result in consolidation of the securitization entities by us 
this would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for example  the impact of the potential consolidation  if applied as of november   would require us to add approximately billion of securitized receivables to our assets and add the related debt issued to third party investors to our 
table of contents liabilities 
as proposed  each amended standard would become effective for us on december  for a discussion of certain risks to us associated with the proposed amendments  see the discussion under item a 
risk factors changes to the accounting treatment of securitization transactions could materially adversely affect our financial condition  reserve requirements  capital requirements  liquidity  cost of funds and operations 
on september   the federal banking agencies issued a joint press release stating that they are evaluating the potential impact that these proposals could have on banking organizations financial statements  regulatory capital  and other regulatory requirements 
in addition  a new fasb staff position  which requires additional disclosures for securitization activities prior to the effective date of the amendments to statement no 
and fin r  was issued on december  that guidance  fasb staff position fas and fin r  disclosures by public entities enterprises about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities fsp fas and fin r  requires inclusion of the new disclosures beginning with our report for the quarter ending february  legislative and regulatory developments the federal reserve board has adopted significant amendments to regulations that limit or modify certain credit card practices  including  but not limited to  restrictions on applying rate increases to existing and new balances  payment allocation  default pricing  notice periods and two cycle billing 
the amendments become effective july  and will significantly impact many of our business practices 
for example  we currently have the ability to increase rates on existing balances to respond to market conditions and consumer behavior 
the amendments will restrict our ability to manage market and credit risk in this manner 
while we anticipate making changes to our pricing  credit and marketing practices that are designed to lessen the impact of these changes  there is no assurance that we will be successful 
if we are not able to lessen the impact of these changes  they will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
legislation introduced in congress in would accelerate the effective date of certain of these requirements 
see item a

segments we manage our business activities in two segments us card and third party payments 
in compiling the segment results that follow  the us card segment bears all overhead costs that are not specifically associated with a particular segment and all costs associated with discover network marketing  servicing and infrastructure  with the exception of an allocation of direct and incremental costs driven by the third party payments segment 
us card 
the us card segment includes discover card branded credit cards issued to individuals and small businesses on the discover network and other consumer products and services  including personal loans  student loans  prepaid cards and other consumer lending and deposit products offered through our discover bank subsidiary 
third party payments 
the third party payments segment includes the pulse network pulse  an automated teller machine  debit and electronic funds transfer network  diners club  a global payments network  and our third party issuing business  which includes credit  debit and prepaid cards issued on the discover network by third parties

us card our us card segment reported pretax income of billion for the year ended november   up million  or  as compared to november  the increase in pretax income was driven principally by payment from mastercard for its portion of the visa and mastercard antitrust litigation settlement and by higher net interest income  partially offset by higher provision for loan losses 
net interest income increased million  or  as higher average loan receivables and the accretion of balance transfer fees  previously recorded in loan fee income  resulted in higher interest income 
net interest income also benefited from lower interest expense driven by a lower cost of funds  which was partially offset by higher borrowings to fund higher loan receivables  higher interest charge offs and lower investment income 
provision for loan losses increased billion  or  as a result of higher net charge offs and a higher reserve rate  each of which is reflective of current economic conditions and recent delinquency trends  as well as owned loan growth due to maturing securitizations 
other income increased million  or  due to the payment from mastercard for its portion of the visa and mastercard antitrust litigation settlement and an increase in discount and interchange revenue partially offset by a write down of the interest only strip receivable and the inclusion of balance transfer fees in interest income beginning in the third quarter of other expenses decreased million  or  primarily due to a million benefit from our pension curtailment  lower account acquisition and promotional marketing activity  and a decrease in costs related to litigation 
the u 
s card segment reported pretax income of billion for the year ended november   down as compared to november  the decrease in pretax income was driven by an increase in provision for loan losses partially offset by higher net interest income 
provisions for loan losses increased million  or  primarily reflecting an increase in bankruptcy charge offs compared to the unusually low levels in as a result of new bankruptcy legislation enacted in october net interest income increased million  or  due to higher interest income  reflecting higher average receivables  partially offset by an increase in interest expense  reflecting increased funding costs and borrowings 

table of contents the managed loan balance of billion at november  was up from november  this increase in loans is attributable to lower cardmember payments  growth in our installment loans during the year and a slight increase in credit card volume  up in  largely due to higher gasoline prices 
this increase was partially offset by lower balance transfer activity in the weakening economic environment adversely impacted cardmember delinquencies and charge offs 
the managed over days delinquency rate for the segment  including non credit card loans  was  basis points higher than last year  and the managed credit card over days delinquency rate was  up basis points from last year 
for the year ended november   the managed segment and credit card charge off rates were and  up and basis points from the comparable prior year periods  respectively 
our loan growth combined with the deterioration in the credit environment led to a million increase to our reserves over and above our net charge offs for the year 
for the year ended november   managed loans grew  to billion  driven by higher sales volume of billion  up over delinquency rates increased from the prior year reflecting weakening in the us economy 
the managed over days delinquency rate for the segment  including non credit card loans  was  basis points higher than  and the managed credit card over days delinquency rate was  up basis points from for the year ended november   the managed segment and credit card charge off rates were and  both down basis points from the comparable prior year periods  respectively 
third party payments transaction volumes  revenues and pretax income in the third party payments segment grew significantly in from our volumes continue to benefit from new issuers and increased volume from existing issuers 
this increase in volume coupled with higher fee income and the inclusion of diners club results for the last five months of the year drove increases in revenues and pretax income 
our third party payments segment reported pretax income of million for the year ended november   up million as compared to the year ended november  revenue increased as a result of a record billion in segment transaction volume  up from last year  and higher fee revenues 
additionally  diners club contributed billion of transaction volume  million of revenues and million of pretax income 
the third party payments segment reported pretax income of million for the year ended november   up as compared to november  the increase in pretax income was driven by higher revenue from increased volumes that was partially offset by higher marketing and pricing incentives and from higher third party card issuer fees 
third party payments volume was billion for the year ended november   up from gaap to managed data reconciliations our senior management evaluates business performance and allocates resources using financial data that is presented on a managed basis 
securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued to third parties are removed from our gaap statements of financial condition 
instances in which we retain certificated beneficial interests in the securitization transactions result in a reduction to loan receivables of the amount of the retained interest and a corresponding increase in available for sale investment securities 
the portions of interest income  provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our gaap statements of income  however  they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions 
we do not establish an allowance for loan losses on our securitized loans  although a factor for uncollectibility is incorporated into the initial gain on sale of securitized loans 

table of contents the managed basis presentation generally reverses the effects of securitization transactions  however  there are certain assets that arise from securitization transactions that are not reversed 
specifically  these assets are the cash collateral accounts that provide credit enhancement to the investors in the transactions and cardmember payments allocated to the securitized loans  both of which are held at the trusts 
these assets also include the interest only strip receivable  reflecting the estimated fair value of the excess cash flows allocated to securitized loans and retained certificated beneficial interests 
income derived from these assets representing interest earned on accounts at the trusts  changes in the fair value of the interest only strip receivable and interest income on investment securities also are not reversed in a managed presentation 
managed loan data is relevant because we service the securitized and owned loans  and the related accounts  in the same manner without regard to ownership of the loans 
management believes it is useful for investors to consider the credit performance of the entire managed loan portfolio to understand the quality of loan originations and the related credit risks inherent in the owned portfolio and retained interests in securitization 
loan receivables on a gaap or owned basis and related performance measures  including yield  charge offs and delinquencies can vary from those presented on a managed basis 
generally  loan receivables included in the securitization trusts are derived from accounts that are more seasoned  while owned loan receivables represent a greater concentration of newer accounts  occurring as a result of the degree to which receivables from newer accounts are added to the trusts 
the seasoning of an account is measured by the age of the account relationship 
in comparison to more seasoned accounts  loan receivables of newer accounts typically carry lower interest yields resulting from introductory offers to new cardmembers and lower charge offs and delinquencies 
financial measures using managed data are non gaap financial measures 
beginning with earnings summary  the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition is on a gaap basis 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the loan receivables and related statistics that are impacted by asset securitization  and which are shown on a managed basis in this annual report on form k  to the most directly comparable gaap basis financial measure reconciliation of gaap to managed data for the years ended november  dollars in thousands loan receivables total loans gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis average total loans gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis interest yield gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis net principal charge off rate gaap basis securitization adjustment managed basis

for estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity  it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period 
for estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions  significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated and combined financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated and combined financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated and combined results 
table of contents of operations and  in certain cases  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 
management has identified the estimates related to allowance for loan losses  asset securitization transactions  the valuation of certificated retained interests in the discover card execution note trust dcent  the accrual of cardmember rewards cost  the evaluation of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment and the accrual of income taxes as critical accounting estimates 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable net loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management evaluates the allowance quarterly for adequacy 
the allowance is maintained through an adjustment to the provision for loan losses 
in estimating losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio  we use an approach that utilizes a migration analysis of delinquent and current credit card receivables 
a migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a loan receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge off 
the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal  interest and fees reflected in loan receivables 
in determining the proper level of the allowance for loan losses  management also considers factors that may impact loan loss experience  including current economic conditions  recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings  account collection management  policy changes  account seasoning  loan volume and amounts  payment rates and forecasting uncertainties 
if management used different assumptions in estimating probable losses  the impact to the allowance for loan losses could have a material effect on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations 
for example  a change in management s estimate of probable net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately million in the allowance for loan losses at november   with a corresponding change in the provision for loan losses 
see note loan receivables to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further details about the allowance for loan losses 
accounting for asset securitization transactions we account for our securitization transactions in accordance with statement no 
the gain on a securitization transaction depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets transferred and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of the transfer 
the interest only strip receivable represents the contractual right to receive interest and certain loan fee revenues less certain costs  including loan losses on securitized loans and the contractual rate of interest paid to third party investors in the securitization as well as a servicing fee from the trust over the life of the asset sold 
in the absence of observable market prices  the fair value of the interest only strip receivable is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows using management s best estimate of the key assumptions  including forecasted interest yield  loan losses and payment rates  the interest paid to investors and a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
changes in the estimated fair value of the interest only strip receivable  as well as certain other retained interests  are recorded in securitization income 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different financial results 
in addition  estimates are likely to change in the future as components of the interest only strip receivable valuation are sensitive to market and economic conditions 
if management used different assumptions in estimating the value of the interest only strip receivable  the impact could have a material effect on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations 
for example  a change in the excess spread assumption for all securitized loans could have resulted in a change of approximately million in the value of the interest only strip receivable as of november  see note credit card securitization activities to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information about the accounting for securitizations 

table of contents valuation of certificated retained interests in dcent we retain certain subordinated beneficial interests in our securitized assets  most significantly  class b and class c notes issued by dcent 
these certificated interests are classified as available for sale investment securities and are carried on our consolidated statement of financial condition at their estimated fair values 
changes in the fair values of these notes are recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
the fair values of these securities are estimated utilizing discounted cash flow models  where the interest and principal payments are discounted at assumed current market rates for the same or comparable transactions 
in doing these valuations  management makes certain assumptions about the credit spreads that market participants would demand on the same or similar investments given the currently inactive market for credit card asset backed securities 
assumed discount rates are derived from indicative pricing observed in the most recent active market for such instruments  adjusted for changes occurring thereafter in relative credit spreads and liquidity risk premiums 
see note investment securities  note credit card securitization activities and note fair value disclosures to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion about the accounting for our certificated retained interests in dcent 
cardmember rewards cost we offer our cardmembers various reward programs  including the cashback bonus reward program  pursuant to which we offer certain cardmembers a reward equal to a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the cardmember s purchases 
the liability for cardmember rewards is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we compute rewards liability on an individual cardmember basis and it is accumulated as qualified cardmembers make progress toward earning a reward through their ongoing purchase activity 
the liability is adjusted for expected forfeitures of accumulated rewards 
we estimate forfeitures based on historical account closure and charge off experience  actual cardmember purchase activity and the terms of the rewards programs 
we recognize reward costs for both owned loans and securitized loans as a reduction of discount and interchange revenue in the consolidated and combined statements of income 
if management used a different estimate of forfeitures  our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations could have differed significantly 
for example  a basis point decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate as of november   could have resulted in an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately million 
the corresponding increase in rewards cost would have been reflected as a decrease in discount and interchange revenue 
see other income and note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further details about cardmember rewards cost 
goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets we recognize goodwill when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the fair values of the acquired net assets 
in addition  we have recognized certain other nonamortizable intangible assets in our acquisition of the diners club business 
as required by gaap  we test goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually  or more often if indicators of impairment exist 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  management must estimate the fair value of the business unit s to which the goodwill relates 
because market data concerning acquisitions of comparable businesses typically are not readily obtainable  other valuation techniques such as earnings multiples and cash flow models are used in estimating the fair values of these businesses 
similarly  in evaluating the other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment  management estimates their fair values using discounted cash flow models 
in applying these techniques  management considers historical results  business forecasts  market and industry conditions and other factors 
we may also consult independent valuation experts where needed in applying these valuation techniques 
the valuation methodologies we use involve assumptions about business performance  revenue and expense growth  discount rates and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature 

table of contents if the assumptions used by management in these valuations are inappropriate  we may be exposed to an impairment loss that  when realized  could have a material impact on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the jurisdictions where we have business operations  primarily the united states  its states and municipalities 
we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations  and tax reserves are established as appropriate 
changes in the estimate of income taxes can occur due to tax rate changes  interpretations of tax laws  the status and resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities  and newly enacted laws and regulations that impact the relative merits of tax positions taken 
when such changes occur  the effect on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations can be significant

the provision for loan losses increased reflecting higher net charge offs and a higher allowance for loan losses as a result of the weakening economic environment 
other income increased million largely due to the million payment by mastercard of its portion of the visa and mastercard antitrust litigation settlement 
other expenses decreased primarily due to the pension curtailment benefit  lower account acquisition and promotional marketing activity  and a decrease in costs related to litigation 

table of contents income from continuing operations for the year ended november  was million  down compared to the year ended november   driven by higher provision for loan losses and higher income tax expense 
the provision for loan losses increased  reflecting a trend toward higher levels of delinquencies as well as a higher level of loans retained on our balance sheet 
income tax expense increased for the year ended november  primarily due to favorable resolution of tax examination issues for the year ended november  as well as the impact of filing state combined returns exclusive of morgan stanley 
net interest income net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets which we own and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets 
net interest margin represents interest income  net of interest expense  as a percentage of total interest earning assets 
our interest earning assets consist of loan receivables  our liquidity reserve which includes federal funds sold and money market mutual funds  certain retained interests in securitization transactions included in amounts due from asset securitization  and investment securities 
interest earning assets do not include investor interests in securitization transactions that have been transferred to third parties since they are not assets which we own 
accordingly  interest income does not include the interest yield on the related loans 
our interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits 
net interest income is influenced by the following the level and composition of interest earning assets and liabilities  including the percentage of floating rate credit card loan receivables we own and the percentage of floating rate liabilities we owe  changes in the interest rate environment  including the levels of interest rates and the relationship between interest rate indices  credit performance of our loans  particularly with regard to charge offs of finance charges which reduce interest income  the terms of certificates of deposit upon initial offering  including maturity and interest rate  and effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program 
net interest income increased million  or  and net interest margin decreased basis points to during the year ended november   as compared to the year ended november   related to a million increase in interest income partially offset by a million increase in interest expense 
during the year ended november   our net interest income improved largely because the lower cost of funds more than offset the increased levels of borrowings to support higher average interest earning assets  including a higher average liquidity reserve which generally earns a lower rate of interest than our other interest earning assets 
interest income increased due to the growth in our credit card and installment loan receivables  the inclusion of million of balance transfer fee amortization in interest income beginning in the third quarter of  previously reported in loan fee income  and a higher average liquidity reserve 
these increases were partially offset by higher finance charge charge offs in addition to the impact of a lower interest rate environment on our floating rate assets  specifically our liquidity reserve  amounts due from securitization and loan receivables  even though of our loan receivables earned interest at floating rates for the year ended november  as compared to in the increase in interest expense was largely due to our higher average funding levels in  partially offset by a basis point decrease to in our cost of funds for the year ended november  as a result of the lower interest rate environment  and the repayment of short term borrowings due to our former parent company prior to our distribution 

table of contents net interest income decreased million  or  and net interest margin decreased basis points to during the year ended november   as compared to the year ended november   related to a million increase in interest expense partially offset by a million increase in interest income 
during the year ended november   our net interest income declined slightly because of higher average interest bearing liabilities and a higher cost of funds  which also negatively impacted our net interest margin  largely offset by higher average interest earning assets 
the level of our average interest bearing liabilities  specifically deposits  during was higher than the previous year  reflecting the financing of the establishment of our liquidity reserve and growth in loan receivables 
the increased levels of floating rate interest bearing liabilities coupled with the higher interest rate environment in as compared to  adversely impacted interest expense 
in addition  the higher interest rate environment in had a negative effect on the cost of issuing new fixed rate certificates of deposit to replace maturing certificates of deposit issued at lower  historical rates 
interest income increased due to a higher level of federal funds sold  which was significantly greater in comparison to the prior year as a result of the establishment of our liquidity reserve  as well as growth in average credit card loan receivables 
the interest yield for the year ended november   was adversely impacted by a higher mix of lower yielding federal funds sold  offset in part by the favorable impact of a higher comparative interest rate environment on floating rate credit card loans and amounts due from asset securitization

loan quality provision for loan losses provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb the estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each period end date 
factors that influence the provision for loan losses include the level and direction of loan delinquencies and charge offs  changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors  bankruptcy trends  regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance  the seasoning of our loan portfolio  interest rate movements and their impact on consumer behavior  and changes in our loan portfolio  including the overall mix of accounts  products and loan balances within the portfolio 
we also consider the credit quality of the loan portfolio in determining the allowance for loan losses 
credit quality at any time reflects  among other factors  our credit granting practices and effectiveness of collection efforts  the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer  and the seasoning of the loans 
see critical accounting estimates and note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion of our policies and net charge offs and delinquencies and non performing loans below for further discussion of credit quality 
for the year ended november   the provision for loan losses increased million  or  compared to the year ended november   reflecting an increase in the level of allowance for loan losses and higher net charge offs 
in the year ended november   we added million to the allowance for loan losses to bring the total allowance to billion  an increase of over november  this 
table of contents increase in the allowance reflects an increase in the loan loss reserve rate due to rising delinquency and charge off rates and loan growth  particularly in the fourth quarter of as we retained more loan receivables from maturing securitizations on our balance sheet in response to the inability to re securitize the receivables as a result of the disruption in the securitization markets 
for the year ended november   the provision for loan losses increased million  or  as compared to the year ended november   reflecting a higher loan portfolio and an increase in delinquencies in the fourth quarter of accordingly  the allowance for loan losses rose to million at november   an increase of million  or  as compared to november  allowance for loan losses the following table provides a summary of the composition of the allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands for the years ended november  balance at beginning of year additions provision for loan losses deductions charge offs recoveries net charge offs translation adjustments and other balance at end of year net charge offs our net charge offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude charged off interest and fees  recoveries of interest and fees and fraud losses 
charged off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest and loan fee income for loan receivables and in securitization income for securitized loans while fraud losses are recorded in other expense 
credit card loans are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes days contractually past due  except in the case of cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts 
cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the day contractual time frame 
the net charge off rate is calculated by dividing net charge offs for the period by the average loan receivables for the period 
the following table presents amounts and rates of net charge offs of loan receivables dollars in thousands for the years ended november  net charge offs the net charge off rate on our loan receivables increased basis points for the year ended november  compared to november  the higher net charge off rate was due to higher delinquencies beginning in the fourth quarter of  reflecting the weakening economic environment as a result of rising unemployment  declining housing prices and the decrease in the availability of consumer credit  as well as an increase in bankruptcy related charge offs 

table of contents the net charge off rate on loan receivables declined basis points for the year ended november  as compared to the year ended november  this decline reflected a continued lower level of bankruptcy related charge offs following the october effective date of the new us bankruptcy legislation  offset in part by a higher level of contractual charge offs 
the bankruptcy legislation  which made it more difficult for individuals to declare bankruptcy  resulted in a surge in bankruptcy receipts and related charge offs in and early accordingly  the year ended november  was adversely impacted by an elevated level of charge offs in the first quarter 
delinquencies and non performing loans delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at any point in time 
loan balances are considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become days past due 
loan receivables are placed on non accrual status upon receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death of a cardmember  as part of certain collection management processes  and other instances in which management feels collectibility is not assured 
the following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of loan receivables over days past due  loan receivables over days delinquent and accruing interest and loan receivables that are not accruing interest  regardless of delinquency dollars in thousands at november  loans over days delinquent loans over days delinquent and accruing interest loans not accruing interest the delinquency rates of loans over days delinquent and loans over days delinquent and accruing interest increased basis points and basis points  respectively  at november   as compared to november  this increase in both measures reflected the impact of the weaker economic environment on our cardmembers ability to pay their loan balances 
delinquency rates normally rise as charge offs rise  however  in  we experienced a pattern of charge offs rising faster than delinquencies due to greater percentage of delinquent accounts flowing into the later stages of delinquency and eventually into charge off and due to an increase in consumer bankruptcy filings 
loan receivables not accruing interest at november  increased basis points to  as compared to november   as a result of an increase in bankruptcy notifications 
the delinquency rate of our loans over days delinquent and loans over days delinquent and accruing interest increased basis points and basis points  respectively  at november   as compared to november   as a result of a weakening us economy 
loan receivables not accruing interest at november  decreased basis points to  as compared to november   as a result of lower bankruptcies 
maturities and sensitivities of loan receivables to changes in interest rates our loan receivables had the following maturity distribution at november  dollars in thousands due one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years total credit card other loan receivables because of the uncertainty regarding loan repayment patterns  which historically have been higher than contractually required minimum payments  this amount may not necessarily be indicative of our actual loan repayments 

table of contents at november   of our loan receivables due after one year  approximately billion had interest rates tied to an index and approximately billion were fixed rate loans 
other income the principal component of other income is securitization income

other income total other income net of rewards  including cashback bonus rewards  of million  million and million for the years ended november   and  respectively 
total other income increased million  or  for the year ended november   as compared to the year ended november   primarily as a result of an million payment from mastercard for its portion of the visa and mastercard antitrust litigation settlement and higher securitization income  partially offset by a decline in loan fee income as balance transfer fees were reported in interest income beginning in the third quarter total other income was relatively flat for the year ended november  as compared to the year ended november   as higher securitization income and other income were largely offset by lower discount and interchange revenue 
for securitization transactions completed on or after november   in accordance with governing securitization documents  we allocate portions of our discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions 
within other income  this change to allocating discount and interchange revenue has the effect of decreasing discount and interchange revenue and increasing securitization income 
the amount of discount and interchange revenue allocated to securitization transactions has increased since this change was made in and is expected to continue increasing as new transactions which include such allocations are completed and or securitizations transactions that did not receive allocations mature 
for the years ended november   and  there were  and  respectively  of average securitized loans to which discount and interchange revenue was allocated 
to broaden merchant acceptance of discover network cards  we began outsourcing our acquisition and servicing of small and mid sized merchants to merchant acquiring organizations in late in addition  we have sold small and mid size merchant portfolios to third party acquirers to facilitate integrated servicing and reduce costs 
as the outsourcing continues  merchant discount has been replaced by acquirer interchange and assessments  which reduces the percentage of income per transaction and  over time  operating expenses as we no longer incur costs to acquire and service small and mid sized merchants 
the lower cost per transaction is generally expected to be offset by increased volume due to broader acceptance 
gains on the sale of merchant acquiring portfolios are reflected in other income as earned 

table of contents securitization income securitization income is a significant source of our income and is derived through the securitization and continued servicing of a portion of the credit card receivables we originated 
the issuance of asset backed securities to investors has the effect of removing the owned loan receivables from the consolidated statements of financial condition 
also  portions of interest income  provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer reported in our statements of income  however  they remain significant factors in determining securitization income we receive on our residual interests in those transactions 
investors in securitizations are allocated the cash flows derived from interest and loan fee revenue earned on securitized loans 
in addition  for securitization transactions completed on or after november   in accordance with governing securitization documents  we allocate portions of our discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions 
these cash flows are used to pay investors in the transactions a contractual fixed or floating rate of return on their investment  to reimburse investors for losses of principal resulting from charged off loans  net of recoveries  and to pay us a contractual fee for servicing the securitized loans 
any excess cash flows remaining are paid to us 
both servicing fees and excess spread are recorded in securitization income 
securitization income also includes the net revaluation of the interest only strip receivable and certain other retained interests  reflecting adjustments to the fair values of the retained interests that result from changes in the level of securitized loans and assumptions used to value the retained interests 
securitization income is significantly influenced by the level of average securitized loans 
for the years ended november   and  the average securitized loans were billion  billion and billion  respectively

for the year ended november   excess spread on securitized loans increased million  or  as compared to the year ended november  the increase was attributable to higher net interest income and higher other fee revenue on securitized loans offset in part by higher net charge offs 
the increase in net interest income related largely to a decrease in interest paid to investors reflective of the impact of a lower average libor on floating rate investor interests  offset in part by higher premiums paid to investors on new transactions 
higher other fee revenue was attributable to the higher level of outstanding securitized loans receiving discount and interchange revenue 
the higher net charge offs were reflective of the weakening economic and credit environment 
for the year ended november   excess spread on securitized loans increased million  or  as compared to the year ended november   due primarily to a higher level of average securitized loans and other fee revenue on securitized loans resulting from the higher level of outstanding securitized loans receiving discount and interchange revenue 
although net interest income increased as a result of the higher level of average securitized loans  the net interest spread for the year ended november  was lower due to a higher rate of return paid on floating rate investor interest due to higher average libor 
servicing fees on securitized loans 
we are paid a servicing fee from the cash flows generated by the securitized loans 
servicing fees are paid to the company for servicing the transferred loan receivables in accordance with contractual requirements 
these cash flows include interest income and loan fee income as well as discount and interchange revenue for certain securitized loans 
for the year ended november   servicing fees increased million  or  from the prior year due to a higher level of securitized loans

the unfavorable revaluation of retained interests of million for the year ended november  largely related to unfavorable changes in assumptions used to value the interest only strip receivable as compared to the previous period end  including lower projected excess spread 
the lower projected excess spread reflected higher projected charge offs  higher interest rate projections and widening spreads on new securitizations as a result of the current trends in the securitization markets 
the net revaluation of retained interests for the year ended november  decreased million as compared to the year ended november  the unfavorable net revaluation of retained interests of million for the year ended november  was primarily attributable to net gain amortization related to the maturity of securitization transactions 
this was offset in part by higher projected excess spread at november   reflecting the lower absolute interest rate environment as compared to that assumed at the prior year end 
the year ended november  also reflected a higher initial gain as a result of a higher level of new securitization transactions as compared to the year ended november  loan fee income loan fee income consists primarily of fees on credit card loans and includes late  overlimit  cash advance and other miscellaneous fees 
loan fee income decreased million  or  for the year ended november   as compared to november   respectively  as a result of deferrals of balance transfer fees beginning in the second quarter of historically accounted for in loan fee income

we offer our cardmembers various reward programs  including the cashback bonus reward program  pursuant to which we pay certain cardmembers a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the cardmember s purchases 
reward costs are recorded as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue 
for securitization transactions completed on or after november   in accordance with governing securitization documents  we allocate portions of discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions  which results in a decrease in discount and interchange revenue and an increase in securitization income 
however  cardmember rewards costs associated with the securitized loans are not allocated to investor interests  and as such  do not impact securitization income 
discount and interchange revenue decreased million  or for the year ended november   compared to november   due to higher allocations to securitized loans  partially offset by lower cardholder rewards costs related to revised forfeiture assumptions and higher discount and interchange revenue 
the increase in allocations to securitized loans was due to a higher level of average outstanding securitized loans receiving such allocations in the current year than in discount and interchange revenue decreased million  or  for the year ended november  as compared to the year ended november   due to higher allocations to securitized loans and higher cardmember rewards  partially offset by an increase in discount and interchange revenue earned related to increased sales volume

liquidity risk is assessed by several measures including our maturity profile  which measures funding in various maturity tranches 
the maturities of the various funding instruments are reviewed during the funding planning and execution process to ensure the maturities are appropriately staggered 
the mix of funding sources and the composition of our investor base are also reviewed during the funding process to assess whether there is appropriate diversification 
our primary funding sources include deposits sourced directly or through brokers  term asset backed securitizations  asset backed commercial paper conduit financing and short term borrowings

the senior preferred stock would be non voting  other than class voting rights on certain matters that could amend the rights of or adversely affect the stock 
the senior preferred stock would be redeemable after three years with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency 
prior to the end of three years  the senior preferred stock may be redeemed with the proceeds from a qualifying equity offering of any tier perpetual preferred or common stock resulting in proceeds of not less than percent of the issue price of the senior preferred stock 
the us treasury may also transfer the senior preferred stock to a third party at any time 
participation in the cpp would restrict our ability to increase dividends on our common stock or to repurchase our common stock until three years have elapsed  unless i all of the senior preferred stock issued to the u 
s treasury is redeemed  ii all of the senior preferred stock issued to the u 
s treasury has been transferred to third parties  or iii we receive the consent of the us treasury

table of contents funding sources securitization financing 
historically  we have used the securitization of credit card receivables as our largest single source of funding  including both the public securitization market and the privately placed asset backed commercial paper conduit financing market 
due to recent market events and continued disruption in the capital markets  the securitization markets have not been available at volumes and pricing levels that would be attractive to us 
our last public securitization transaction closed on june   and our last private asset backed commercial paper conduit transaction closed on august  it is difficult to predict if or when the securitization markets will return to historical capacity and pricing levels  but we currently do not expect to be able to access these markets during in november  the federal reserve announced the introduction of the term asset backed securities loan facility the talf in an effort to facilitate the issuance of asset backed securities and improve the market conditions for asset backed securities generally 
it is unclear at this time what impact the talf program will have on returning the securitization market to historical capacity and pricing levels 
our response to the tightened securitization markets has been  and will continue to be  utilization of deposits 
for more information  see the outlook section at the beginning of this item and deposits below 
we use non consolidated securitization trusts to securitize our credit card loan receivables 
securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are accounted for as sold and  accordingly  are removed from the consolidated statements of financial condition 
we have historically securitized between approximately and of our managed credit card loan receivables

we access the public asset securitization market through the discover card master trust i and  beginning july   dcent  using receivables generated by our us card business 
through the discover card master trust i  we have used a structure utilizing class a  triple a rated certificates and class b  single a rated certificates held by third parties  with credit enhancement provided by the subordinated class b certificates and a cash collateral account 
dcent includes three classes of securities sold to investors  the most senior class generally receiving a triple a rating 
in this structure  in order to issue senior  higher rated classes of notes  it is necessary to obtain the appropriate amount of credit enhancement  generally through the issuance of junior  lower rated classes of notes 
as of november   we had triple a rated note issuance capacity of billion in dcent  subject to market availability 
in order to maintain this level of triple a rated note issuance capacity  we have purchased billion principal amount of subordinated notes issued by dcent  which are classified as available for sale investment securities for accounting purposes

the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of the cash collateral accounts at november  dollars in thousands total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years after five years scheduled maturities of cash collateral accounts the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors that could result in earlier than expected repayment of the underlying securities  accelerating the need for alternative funding 
the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities 
we refer to this as economic early amortization 
in the event of an economic early amortization which would occur if the excess spread the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period  including interest collections  fees and interchange  exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period  including interest expense  servicing fees and charged off receivables falls below for a contractually specified period  generally a three month rolling average  the receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trust from us would instead continue to be recognized on our consolidated statement of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trust would instead be used to repay investors in the asset backed securities 
as of november   no economic early amortization events have occurred

deposits 
we utilize deposits to diversify funding sources and to reduce our reliance on short term credit sensitive funding sources  thus enhancing our liquidity position 
our response to the disruptions in the securitization market has been  and we anticipate will continue to be  increased utilization of deposits 
we obtain our deposits through two channels agency arrangements with securities brokerage firms  which place deposits with their customers  and  increasingly  products offered directly to consumers through direct mail  internet origination and affinity relationships  including certificates of deposit and money market accounts 
we currently utilize six of the largest securities brokerage firms to obtain deposit funding through distribution of our certificates of deposit to their customers 
four of these six brokerage firms have external selling group capability  which allows them to distribute deposits through other brokerage firms which can exceed a group of brokers 
we have elected to use the selling group capabilities of these brokerage firms to extend deposit gathering capabilities for cost effectiveness 

table of contents our certificates of deposit have maturities ranging from one month to fifteen years  and had a weighted average maturity of months at november   which is up from months at november  as a result of issuances of deposits with longer maturities 
total interest bearing deposits at november  were billion  the remaining maturities of which are summarized in the following table dollars in thousands total three months or less over three months through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months certificates of deposit in amounts less than  certificates of deposit in amounts of  or greater savings deposits  including money market deposit accounts total interest bearing deposits represents the basic insurance amount covered by the fdic 
effective october   the united states congress temporarily increased fdic deposit insurance to  through december  short term borrowings 
short term borrowings consist of borrowings through the federal reserve s term auction facility  term  overnight federal funds purchased and other short term borrowings with original maturities of less than one year 
on november   discover bank borrowed million through the term auction facility at an interest rate of bps for a period of days 
this allowed discover bank to obtain funding at a lower interest rate than alternatives existing at that time

at november   we had million principal amount of floating rate senior notes outstanding which mature in june and million principal amount of fixed rate senior notes outstanding which mature in june additionally  we had million principal amount of bank notes outstanding at november  which mature in february in october  the federal deposit insurance corporation established the temporary liquidity guarantee program the tlgp pursuant to which the fdic will guarantee the timely payment of interest and principal on certain newly issued senior unsecured debt of eligible entities issued on or before june  discover bank has opted into the tlgp and is eligible to receive the benefit of the tlgp guarantee in connection with the issuance of senior unsecured debt of up to million 
while it is unclear at this time whether discover bank will be issuing unsecured debt pursuant to the tlgp  our participation in this program may provide us access to an additional source of funding 

table of contents available credit facilities secured committed credit facilities 
the maintenance of revolving committed credit agreements serves to further diversify our funding sources 
in connection with our asset securitization program  we have access to committed undrawn funding capacity through privately placed asset backed commercial paper conduits to support credit card loan receivables funding requirements 
at november   these conduits totaled billion  of which billion was unused 
the original commitments of these facilities range from day renewable agreements to multi year extendable commitments 
unsecured committed credit facilities 
as of november   our unsecured committed credit facility of billion had a remaining life of months 
this facility serves to diversify our funding sources and enhance our liquidity 
this facility became effective at the time of the distribution  is provided by a group of major global banks  and is available to both discover financial services and discover bank discover financial services may borrow up to and discover bank may borrow up to of the total commitment 
we anticipate that the facility will support general liquidity needs and may be drawn to meet short term funding needs from time to time 
at november   we had no outstanding balances due under the facility 
federal reserve 
discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphia s discount window and has participated in the federal reserve s term auction facility 
in december  the federal reserve announced the establishment of a temporary term auction facility 
all depository institutions that are judged to be in generally sound financial condition by their local reserve bank and that are eligible to borrow under the primary credit discount window program are eligible to participate in term auction facility auctions 
discover bank had billion of available capacity through the federal discount window as of november   which was reduced to billion after we borrowed an additional million through the federal reserve s term auction facility in december off balance sheet arrangements see liquidity and capital resources funding sources securitization financing

table of contents contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments 
contractual obligations at november  include deposits  long term borrowings  operating and capital lease obligations and purchase obligations 
our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations as of november  are summarized below dollars in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years more than five years deposits bank notes secured borrowings unsecured borrowings capital lease obligations operating leases interest payments on fixed rate debt purchase obligations total contractual obligations see note deposits to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information concerning our deposits 
the certificates of deposit accrue interest at fixed rates 
all other interest bearing deposits accrue interest at variable rates

such commitments arise primarily from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards  provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement 
these commitments  substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties 
the activities of the subsidiaries covered by any such guarantees are included in our consolidated and combined financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  rates  indices  correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio 
we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates impact interest earning assets  principally managed loan receivables 
changes in interest rates also impact interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets  including asset backed securitizations  deposits  and short term and long term borrowings 
our interest rate risk management policies are designed to measure and manage the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of credit card loan receivables 
to the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively  we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts  such as swap agreements  to achieve our objectives 
interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to floating rate or from floating to fixed rate 
we use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure 
for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical  adverse change in interest rates over the month period from our reporting date  we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period 
the sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously  simultaneously and to the same degree 
our interest rate sensitive assets include certain loan receivables  federal funds sold  certain amounts due from asset securitizations  interest earning deposits and certain investment securities 
portions of our credit card loan receivables have fixed interest rates  although we currently have the right  with notice to cardmembers  to subsequently reprice these receivables to a new interest rate unless the account has been closed or the cardmember opts out of repricing actions 
assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature  or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the month period  are considered to be rate sensitive 
the latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period  such as balance transfers and special promotional programs  after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with our normal market based pricing structure 
for purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans  only the effect of the hypothetical basis point change in the underlying market based indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice 
for assets that have a fixed interest rate at the fiscal period end but which contractually will  or are assumed to  reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next months  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
in addition  for all interest rate sensitive assets  earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses 
interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next month period 
thus  liabilities that vary with changes in a market based index  such as federal funds or libor  which will reset before the end of the month period  or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the fiscal period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the month period  also are considered to be rate sensitive 
for these fixed rate liabilities  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
assuming an immediate basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at november   we estimate that the pretax income of lending and related activities reported on a managed basis over the following month period would be reduced by approximately million 
we estimate the comparable reduction of pretax income for the month period following november  to be approximately million 
a predominate portion of this change can be attributed to changes we made to our market risk model 
we have moved from a static view of future balances towards a more dynamic approach that portrays our business forecast 
the change is also due to having fewer interest rate sensitive liabilities 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as of november   we believe our foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
