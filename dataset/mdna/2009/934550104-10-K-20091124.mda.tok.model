use of oibda we evaluate our operating performance based on several factors  including our primary financial measure of operating income loss before non cash depreciation of tangible assets  non cash amortization of intangible assets and non cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets which we 
table of contents refer to as oibda 
we consider oibda to be an important indicator of the operational strengths and performance of our businesses  including the ability to provide cash flows to service debt 
however  a limitation of the use of oibda as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses 
accordingly  oibda should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  operating income  net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap

use of constant currency as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons  we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve the ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods 
constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period 
we use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance 
we calculate constant currency by calculating prior year results using current year foreign currency exchange rates 
we generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
these results should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  results reported in accordance with us gaap 
results on a constant currency basis  as we present them  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and is not a measure of performance presented in accordance with us gaap 
overview we are one of the world s major music content companies 
we classify our business interests into two fundamental operations recorded music and music publishing 
a brief description of each of those operations is presented below 
recorded music operations our recorded music business primarily consists of the discovery and development of artists and the related marketing  distribution and licensing of recorded music produced by such artists 
we are also diversifying our revenues beyond our traditional businesses by entering into expanded rights deals with recording artists in order to partner with artists in other areas of their careers 
under these agreements  we provide services to and participate in artists activities outside the traditional recorded music business 
we are building artist services capabilities and platforms for exploiting this broader set of music related rights and participating more broadly in the monetization of the artist brands we help create 
in developing our artist services business  we have both built and expanded in house capabilities and expertise and have acquired a number of existing artist services companies involved in artist management  merchandising  strategic marketing and brand management  ticketing  concert promotion  fan club  original programming and video entertainment 
we believe that entering into expanded rights deals and enhancing our artist services capabilities will permit us to diversify revenue streams to better capitalize on the growth areas of the music industry and permit us to build stronger  long term relationships with artists and more effectively connect artists and fans 
in the us  our recorded music operations are conducted principally through our major record labels warner bros 
records and the atlantic records group 
our recorded music operations also include rhino  a division that specializes in marketing our music catalog through compilations and reissuances of previously released music and video titles  as well as in the licensing of recordings to and from third parties for various uses  including film and television soundtracks 
rhino has also become our primary licensing division focused on acquiring broader licensing rights from certain catalog recording artists 
for example  we have an exclusive 
table of contents license with the grateful dead to manage the band s intellectual property and in november we acquired a interest in frank sinatra enterprises  an entity that administers licenses for use of frank sinatra s name and likeness and manages all aspects of his music  film and stage content 
the company also conducts its recorded music operations through a collection of additional record labels  including  among others  asylum  cordless  east west  elektra  nonesuch  reprise  roadrunner  rykodisc  sire and word 
outside the us  our recorded music activities are conducted in more than countries primarily through wmi and its various subsidiaries  affiliates and non affiliated licensees 
wmi engages in the same activities as our us labels discovering and signing artists and distributing  marketing and selling their recorded music 
in most cases  wmi also markets and distributes the records of those artists for whom our domestic record labels have international rights 
in certain smaller countries  wmi licenses to unaffiliated third party record labels the right to distribute its records 
the company s international artist services operations also include a network of concert promoters through which wmi provides resources to coordinate tours 
our recorded music distribution operations include wea corp  which markets and sells music and dvd products to retailers and wholesale distributors in the us  ada  which distributes the products of independent labels to retail and wholesale distributors in the us  various distribution centers and ventures operated internationally  an interest in word entertainment  which specializes in the distribution of music products in the christian retail marketplace  and ada global  which provides distribution services outside of the us through a network of affiliated and non affiliated distributors 
we play an integral role in virtually all aspects of the music value chain from discovering and developing talent to producing albums and promoting artists and their products 
after an artist has entered into a contract with one of the company s record labels  a master recording of the artist s music is created 
the recording is then replicated for sale to consumers primarily in the cd and digital formats 
in the us  wea corp  ada and word market  sell and deliver product  either directly or through sub distributors and wholesalers  to record stores  mass merchants and other retailers 
our recorded music products are also sold in physical form to online physical retailers such as amazon 
com  barnesandnoble 
com and bestbuy 
com and in digital form to online digital retailers like apple s itunes and mobile full track download stores such as those operated by verizon or sprint 
in the case of expanded rights deals where we acquire broader rights in a recording artist s career  we may provide more comprehensive career support and actively develop new opportunities for an artist through touring  fan clubs  merchandising and sponsorships  among other areas 
we believe expanded rights deals create a better partnership with our artists  which allows the company to work together more closely with them to create and sustain artistic and commercial success 
we have integrated the sale of digital content into all aspects of its recorded music and music publishing businesses including a r  marketing  promotion and distribution 
our new media executives work closely with a r departments to make sure that while a record is being made  digital assets are also created with all of our distribution channels in mind  including subscription services  social networking sites  online portals and music centered destinations 
we work side by side with our mobile and online partners to test new concepts 
we believe existing and new digital businesses will be a significant source of growth for the next several years and will provide new opportunities to monetize our assets and create new revenue streams 
as a music based content company  our assets that go beyond our recorded music and music publishing catalogs  such as our music video library  which we have begun to monetize through digital channels 
the proportion of digital revenues attributed to each distribution channel varies by region and since digital music is in the relatively early stages of growth  proportions may change as the roll out of new technologies continues 
as an owner of musical content  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of growth in digital distribution and emerging technologies to maximize the value of our assets 
recorded music revenues are derived from three main sources physical and other the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to sales of physical products such as cds and dvds 
we are also diversifying our revenues beyond sales of physical products and receive other revenues from our artist services business and our participation in expanded rights associated with 
table of contents our artists and other artists  including sponsorship  fan club  websites  merchandising  touring  ticketing and artist and brand management  digital the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to online and mobile downloads  mobile ringtones and online and mobile streaming  and licensing the rightsholder receives royalties or fees for the right to use the sound recording in combination with visual images such as in films or television programs  television commercials and videogames 
the principal costs associated with our recorded music operations are as follows royalty costs and artist and repertoire costs the costs associated with i paying royalties to artists  producers  songwriters  other copyright holders and trade unions  ii signing and developing artists  iii creating master recordings in the studio and iv creating artwork for album covers and liner notes  product costs the costs to manufacture  package and distribute product to wholesale and retail distribution outlets as well as those principal costs related to expanded rights  selling and marketing costs the costs associated with the promotion and marketing of artists and recorded music products  including costs to produce music videos for promotional purposes and artist tour support  and general and administrative costs the costs associated with general overhead and other administrative costs 
music publishing operations where recorded music is focused on exploiting a particular recording of a song  music publishing is an intellectual property business focused on the exploitation of the song itself 
in return for promoting  placing  marketing and administering the creative output of a songwriter  or engaging in those activities for other rightsholders  our music publishing business garners a share of the revenues generated from use of the song 
our music publishing operations include warner chappell  our global music publishing company headquartered in new york with operations in over countries through various subsidiaries  affiliates and non affiliated licensees 
we own or control rights to more than one million musical compositions  including numerous pop hits  american standards  folk songs and motion picture and theatrical compositions 
assembled over decades  our award winning catalog includes over  songwriters and composers and a diverse range of genres including pop  rock  jazz  country  r b  hip hop  rap  reggae  latin  folk  blues  symphonic  soul  broadway  techno  alternative  gospel and other christian music 
warner chappell also administers the music and soundtracks of several third party television and film producers and studios  including lucasfilm  ltd  hallmark entertainment  disney music publishing and hbo 
in  we entered the production music library business with the acquisition of non stop music 
production music is a complementary alternative to licensing standards and contemporary hits for television  film and advertising producers 
publishing revenues are derived from five main sources mechanical the licensor receives royalties with respect to compositions embodied in recordings sold in any physical format or configuration eg  cds and dvds  performance the licensor receives royalties if the composition is performed publicly through broadcast of music on television  radio  cable and satellite  live performance at a concert or other venue eg  arena concerts  nightclubs  online and wireless streaming and performance of music in staged theatrical productions  
table of contents synchronization the licensor receives royalties or fees for the right to use the composition in combination with visual images such as in films or television programs  television commercials and videogames as well as from other uses such as in toys or novelty items and merchandise  digital the licensor receives royalties or fees with respect to internet and mobile downloads  mobile ringtones and online and mobile streaming  and other the licensor receives royalties for use in sheet music 
the principal costs associated with our music publishing operations are as follows artist and repertoire costs the costs associated with i signing and developing songwriters and ii paying royalties to songwriters  co publishers and other copyright holders in connection with income generated from the exploitation of their copyrighted works  and general and administration costs the costs associated with general overhead and other administrative costs 
factors affecting results of operations and financial condition market factors since  the recorded music industry has been unstable and the worldwide market has contracted considerably  which has adversely affected our operating results 
the industry wide decline can be attributed primarily to digital piracy 
other drivers of this decline are the bankruptcies of record retailers and wholesalers  growing competition for consumer discretionary spending and retail shelf space  and the maturation of the cd format  which has slowed the historical growth pattern of recorded music sales 
while cd sales still generate most of the recorded music revenues  cd sales continue to decline industry wide and we expect that trend to continue 
while new formats for selling recorded music product have been created  including the legal downloading of digital music using the internet and the distribution of music on mobile devices  significant revenue streams from these new formats are just beginning to emerge and have not yet reached a level where they offset the declines in cd sales 
the recorded music industry performance may continue to negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  a declining recorded music industry could continue to have an adverse impact on the music publishing business 
this is because our music publishing business generates a significant portion of its revenues from mechanical royalties from the sale of music in cd and other physical recorded music formats 
current uncertainty in global economic conditions poses a risk to the overall economy  which could negatively affect demand for our products and other related matters 
while the music industry has been relatively resilient in prior financial downturns as its products are low priced relative to other entertainment goods  we have been negatively impacted by these global economic conditions  which have resulted in significant recessionary pressures and lower consumer confidence and lower retail sales in general 
the current uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict product demand and other related matters and makes it more likely that our actual results could differ materially from our expectations 
even in the midst of the global economic slowdown  we remain committed to executing on our strategic initiatives and plan to continue our transformation to adapt to the changing music industry in order to maximize cash flow and profitability 
we expect to adapt to the impact of the economic slowdown with a particular focus on cash and liquidity 
we will monitor current events closely and take advantage of our flexible cost structure to minimize any impact 
realignment plan for fiscal year in fiscal  we implemented a realignment plan intended to better align the company s workforce with the changing nature of the music industry 
these changes were part of our continued evolution from a traditional record and songs based business to a music based content company and our ongoing management of our cost structure 
the changes included a continued redeployment of resources to focus on new business initiatives to help us diversify our revenue streams  including digital opportunities 
the realignment plan was also designed to 
table of contents improve the operating effectiveness of our current businesses and to realign our management structure to  among other things  effectively address the continued development of digital distribution channels along with the decline of industry wide cd sales 
the plan consisted of the reorganization of management structures to more adequately and carefully address regional needs and new business requirements  to reduce organizational complexity and to improve leadership channels 
we also continued to shift resources from our physical sales channels to efforts focused on digital distribution and emerging technologies and other new revenue streams 
part of the plan also resulted in the outsourcing of some back office functions as a cost savings measure 
the changes described above were all implemented in fiscal year we incurred substantially all of the costs associated with the realignment plan in fiscal year this included approximately million of restructuring costs and million of implementation costs  primarily all of which were paid in cash 
in connection with the plan  we reduced headcount by approximately employees 
we expect that the majority of any cost savings will be offset by new business initiatives in areas related to digital distribution and video 
there were no charges related to our realignment plan incurred in fiscal year settlements in april  we entered into an agreement with bertelsmann ag bertelsmann related to a settlement of contingent claims held by us relating to bertelsmann s relationship with napster in the settlement covers the resolution of the related legal claims against bertelsmann by our recorded music and music publishing businesses 
as part of the settlement  we have received million  which we have shared with our recording artists and songwriters 
we recorded million of other income in the fiscal year ended september  related to the settlement 
we allocated of the settlement to our recorded music business and of the settlement to our music publishing business 
of such amount  million was recorded as income to recorded music and million was recorded as income to music publishing 
these amounts were recorded net of amounts payable to our recording artists and songwriters 
in september  the major record companies reached a global out of court settlement of copyright litigation against the operators of the kazaa peer to peer network 
under the terms of the settlement  the kazaa defendants agreed to pay compensation to the record companies that brought the action  including us 
we recorded approximately million of other income related to this settlement in the fiscal year ended september  these amounts were recorded net of the estimated amounts payable to our artists in respect of royalties 
the cash related to this settlement was received in the first quarter of fiscal we recorded approximately million of other income in conjunction with a contingent payment related to this settlement in fiscal year mechanical royalties payment in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the us recorded music and music publishing industries reached an agreement for payment of mechanical royalties which were accrued by us record companies in prior years 
in connection with this agreement  our music publishing business recognized a benefit of million in revenue and million in oibda

senior subordinated notes 
the acquisition corp 
senior subordinated notes mature on april  and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum on the million dollar notes and per annum on the million sterling denominated notes 
the indenture governing the acquisition corp 
senior subordinated notes limits our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares  to pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments  to make certain investments  to sell certain assets  to create liens on certain debt without securing the notes  to consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  to enter into certain transactions with affiliates and to designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries

holdings discount notes as of september   holdings had million of debt represented by the holdings discount notes  net of issuance discounts 
the holdings discount notes were issued at a discount and had an initial accreted value of per  principal amount at maturity 
prior to december   no cash interest payments accrue 
however  interest accrues on the holdings discount notes in the form of an increase in the accreted value of such notes such that the accreted value of the holdings discount notes will equal the principal amount at maturity of million on december  thereafter  cash interest on the holdings discount notes is payable semi annually at a fixed rate of per annum with the initial cash interest payment payable on june  the holdings discount notes mature on december  the indenture governing the holdings discount notes limits our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares  to pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of its capital stock or make other restricted payments  to make certain investments  to sell certain assets  to create liens on certain debt without securing the notes  to consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets  to enter into certain transactions with affiliates  and to designate its subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries 
subject to certain exceptions  the indenture governing the notes permits holdings and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  including secured indebtedness  and to make certain restricted payments and investments 
dividends we discontinued our previous policy of paying a regular quarterly dividend during the second quarter of fiscal year we currently intend to retain future earnings to build cash on the balance sheet for other purposes  such as investing in our business  particularly in a r  or assisting with repurchasing or refinancing our indebtedness 
any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on  among other things  our results of operations  cash requirements  financial condition  contractual restrictions and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant 
on february   we declared our final quarterly dividend under the now discontinued policy on our outstanding common stock at a rate of per share 
the final dividend was paid on february  on december   march   june  and september  we declared dividends on our 
table of contents outstanding common stock at a rate of per share 
the dividends were paid on february   april   july  and october   respectively 
covenant compliance the indentures governing the holdings discount notes  the acquisition corp 
senior subordinated notes and the senior secured notes contain certain financial covenants  which limit the ability of our restricted subsidiaries as defined in the indentures governing the notes to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  issue certain preferred shares  pay dividends  make certain investments  sell certain assets  create liens on certain debt  and consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all  or some of  our assets 
in order for acquisition corp 
and holdings to incur additional debt or make certain restricted payments using certain exceptions provided for in the indentures governing the acquisition corp 
senior subordinated notes  the senior secured notes and holdings discount notes  the fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in such indentures  must exceed a to ratio 
fixed charges are defined in such indentures as consolidated interest expense excluding certain non cash interest expense 
the terms of the indentures governing the acquisition corp 
senior subordinated notes  the senior secured notes and holdings discount notes significantly restrict acquisition corp  holdings and other subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to us 
for example  the ability of acquisition corp 
and holdings to make such payments is governed by a formula based on of each of their consolidated net income which  as defined in the indentures governing such notes  excludes goodwill impairment charges and any after tax extraordinary  unusual or nonrecurring gains and losses accruing from july  under the indentures governing the acquisition corp 
senior subordinated notes  the holdings discount notes  and july  under the acquisition corp 
senior secured notes  plus in each case proceeds from equity offerings and capital contributions  among other items 
in addition  as a condition to making such payments to us based on such formula  acquisition corp 
and holdings must each have an adjusted ebitda  as defined in the indenture  to interest expense ratio of at least to after giving effect to any such payments 
notwithstanding such restrictions  the indentures governing the acquisition corp 
senior subordinated notes  the holdings discount notes and the acquisition corp 
senior secured notes permit an aggregate of million  million  and million  respectively  of such payments to be made by acquisition corp 
and holdings pursuant to the indentures  whether or not there is availability under the formula or the conditions to its use are met 
the indenture governing the senior secured notes also permits acquisition corp 
to make restricted payments not to exceed million in any fiscal year 
acquisition corp 
and holdings may make additional restricted payments using certain other exceptions provided for in the indentures governing the acquisition corp 
senior subordinated notes  the senior secured notes and holdings discount notes 
summary management believes that funds generated from our operations will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements  working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
we also have additional borrowing capacity under our indentures 
however  our ability to continue to fund these items and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors  as well as other industry specific factors such as the ability to control music piracy and the continued decline of industry wide cd sales 
we or any of our affiliates may also  from time to time depending on market conditions and prices  contractual restrictions  our financial liquidity and other factors  seek to repurchase our holdings discount notes  our acquisition corp 
senior subordinated notes or our senior secured notes and or common stock in open market purchases  privately negotiated purchases or otherwise 
the amounts involved in any such transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material and may be funded from available cash or from additional borrowings 
in addition  we may from time to time  depending on market conditions and

total firm commitments and outstanding debt the following is a description of our firmly committed contractual obligations at september  outstanding debt obligations consist of the senior secures notes  the acquisition corp 
senior subordinated notes and the holdings discount notes 
these obligations have been presented based on the principal amounts due  current and long term as of september  amounts do not include any fair value adjustments  bond premiums  discounts or interest payments 
the interest obligations do not include interest related to our variable rate debt 
see note to the audited financial statements for a description of our financing arrangements 
holdings discount notes payments include cash interest payments of million for the fiscal year ending september   million for each fiscal year ending september     and million for the fiscal year ending september  as well as principal payments of million in the fiscal year ending september  operating lease obligations primarily relate to the minimum lease rental obligations for our real estate and operating equipment in various locations around the world 
these obligations have been presented with the benefit of million of sublease income expected to be received under non cancelable agreements 
the future minimum payments reflect the amounts owed under our lease arrangements and do not include any fair market value adjustments that may have been recorded as a result of the acquisition 
we enter into long term commitments with artists  songwriters and co publishers for the future delivery of music product 
aggregate firm commitments to such talent approximated million across hundreds of artists  songwriters  publishers  songs and albums at september  such commitments  which are unpaid advances across multiple albums and songs  are payable principally over a ten year period  generally upon delivery of albums from the artists or future musical compositions by songwriters and co publishers 
because the timing of payment  and even whether 
table of contents payment occurs  is dependent upon the timing of delivery of albums and musical compositions from talent  the timing and amount of payment of these commitments as presented in the above summary can vary significantly 
we have minimum funding commitments and other related obligations to support the operations of various investments 
market risk management we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in market rates and prices  including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency risk we have significant transactional exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar due to the global scope of our operations 
for the fiscal year ended september   approximately billion  or  of our revenues were generated outside of the us the top five revenue producing international countries are the uk  japan  france  germany and italy  which use the british pound sterling  japanese yen and euro as currencies  respectively 
see note to our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein for information on our operations in different geographical areas 
historically  we have used and continue to use foreign exchange forward contracts  primarily to hedge the risk that unremitted or future royalties and license fees owed to our domestic companies for the sale  or anticipated sale  of us copyrighted products abroad may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we hedge foreign currency risk associated with financing transactions such as third party and inter company debt 
we focus on managing the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our major currencies  which include the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  canadian dollar  swedish krona and australian dollar 
see note to our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein for additional information 
the company also is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its million principal amount of sterling denominated notes that were issued in april these sterling notes mature on april  as of september   these sterling notes had a carrying value of million 
based on the principal amount of sterling denominated notes outstanding as of september  and assuming that all other market variables are held constant including the level of interest rates  a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar compared to the british pound sterling would not have an impact on the fair value of these sterling notes  since these notes are completely hedged as of september  interest rate risk we have billion debt outstanding at september  based on the level of interest rates prevailing at september   the fair value of this fixed rate debt was approximately billion 
further  based on the amount of our fixed rate debt  a basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million and million  respectively 
this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of fixed rate debt remains constant with an immediate across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no subsequent changes in rates for the remainder of the period 
we monitor our positions with  and the credit quality of  the financial institutions that are party to any of our financial transactions 

table of contents critical accounting policies the sec s financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in our application 
we believe the following list represents the critical accounting policies of us as contemplated by frr for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein 
purchase accounting we account for our business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 business combinations fas 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives and market multiples  among other items 
in addition  reserves have been established on our balance sheet related to acquired liabilities and qualifying restructuring costs based on assumptions made at the time of acquisition 
we evaluate these reserves on a regular basis to determine the adequacy or accuracy of the amounts estimated 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets we account for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets as required by fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
under asc the company no longer amortizes goodwill  including the goodwill included in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and certain other intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life 
asc requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis and when events occur that may suggest that the fair value of such assets cannot support the carrying value 
goodwill impairment is tested using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the impairment test for other intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant 
table of contents impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available and  if deemed necessary  we obtain appraisals from independent valuation firms to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  if any 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows  market comparisons and analysis of recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
we test our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter each fiscal year 
we tested our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter of and noted that no impairment occurred 
as of september   warner music group has recorded goodwill in the amount of billion  primarily related to the acquisition 
see note to our audited financial statements included herein for a further discussion of warner music group s goodwill 
equity method and cost method investments for non publicly traded investments  management s assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows  estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals  as appropriate 
the ability to accurately predict future cash flows  especially in developing and unstable markets  may impact the determination of fair value 
in the event a decline in fair value of an investment occurs  management may be required to determine if the decline in market value is other than temporary 
management s assessments as to the nature of a decline in fair value are based on the valuation methodologies discussed above and our ability and intent to hold the investment 
we consider our equity method investees to be strategic long term investments  therefore  we generally complete our assessments with a long term viewpoint 
if the fair value of any of our equity method or cost method investments is less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying value of the investment to its fair value 
management s assessments of fair value in accordance with these valuation methodologies represent our best estimates as of the time of the impairment review and are consistent with our internal planning 
if different fair values were estimated  this could have a material impact on the financial statements 
revenue and cost recognition sales returns and uncollectible accounts in accordance with practice in the recorded music industry and as customary in many territories  certain products such as cds and dvds are sold to customers with the right to return unsold items 
under fasb asc topic  revenue recognition  revenues from such sales are recognized when the products are shipped based on gross sales less a provision for future estimated returns 
in determining the estimate of product sales that will be returned  management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and commercial acceptance of our products 
based on this information  management reserves a percentage of each dollar of product sales to provide for the estimated customer returns 
similarly  management evaluates accounts receivables to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgments and estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for larger accounts and customers  and a receivables aging analysis that 
table of contents determines the percent that has historically been uncollected by aged category 
based on this information  management provides a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible 
based on management s analysis of sales returns and uncollectible accounts  reserves totaling million and million have been established at september  and september   respectively 
the ratio of our receivable allowances to gross accounts receivables were approximately and at september  and september   respectively 
gross versus net revenue classification in the normal course of business  we act as an intermediary or agent with respect to certain payments received from third parties 
for example  we distribute music product on behalf of third party record labels 
the accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the ultimate customer or on the net amount received from the customer after participation and other royalties paid to third parties 
to the extent revenues are recorded gross in the full amount billed  any participations and royalties paid to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount gross revenues  less expenses flows through operating income 
accordingly  the impact on operating income is the same  whether we record the revenue on a gross basis or net basis less related participations and royalties 
determining whether revenue should be reported gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal in a transaction or acting as an agent in the transaction 
to the extent we are acting as a principal in a transaction  we report as revenue the payments received on a gross basis 
to the extent we are acting as an agent in a transaction  we report as revenue the payments received less participations and royalties paid to third parties  ie  on a net basis 
the determination of whether we are serving as principal or agent in a transaction is judgmental in nature and based on an evaluation of the terms of an arrangement 
in determining whether we serve as principal or agent in these arrangements  we follow the guidance in fasb asc subtopic  principal agent considerations asc 
pursuant to such guidance  we serve as the principal in transactions where we have the substantial risks and rewards of ownership 
the indicators that we have substantial risks and rewards of ownership are as follows we are the supplier of the products or services to the customer  we have latitude in establishing prices  we have the contractual relationship with the ultimate customer  we modify and service the product purchased to meet the ultimate customer specifications  we have discretion in supplier selection  and we have credit risk 
conversely  pursuant to asc  we serve as agent in arrangements where we do not have substantial risks and rewards of ownership 
the indicators that we do not have substantial risks and rewards of ownership are as follows the supplier not warner music group is responsible for providing the product or service to the customer  the supplier not warner music group has latitude in establishing prices  the amount we earn is fixed  
table of contents the supplier not warner music group has credit risk  and the supplier not warner music group has general inventory risk for a product before it is sold 
based on the above criteria and for the more significant transactions that we have evaluated  we record the distribution of product on behalf of third party record labels on a gross basis  subject to the terms of the contract 
however  recorded music compilations distributed by other record companies where we have a right to participate in the profits are recorded on a net basis 
accounting for royalty advances we regularly commit to and pay advance royalties to our artists and songwriters in respect of future sales 
we account for these advance royalty payments under the related guidance in fasb asc topic  entertainment music asc 
under asc  we capitalize as assets certain advance royalty payments that management believes are recoverable from future royalties to be earned by the artist or songwriter 
management s decision to capitalize an advance to an artist or songwriter as an asset requires significant judgment as to the recoverability of these advances 
the recoverability of these assets is assessed upon initial commitment of the advance based upon management s forecast of anticipated revenues from the sale of future and existing music and publishing related products 
in determining whether these amounts are recoverable  management evaluates the current and past popularity of the artist or songwriter  the initial or expected commercial acceptability of the product  the current and past popularity of the genre of music that the product is designed to appeal to  and other relevant factors 
based upon this information  management expenses the portion of such advances that it believes is not recoverable 
in many cases  royalty advance payments to artists or publishers without history of successful commercial acceptability of the product and evidence of current or past popularity will be expensed immediately 
all advances are assessed for recoverability continuously and at minimum on a quarterly basis 
we had million and million of advances on our balance sheet as of september  and  respectively 
we believe such advances are recoverable through future royalties to be earned by the related artists and songwriters 
stock based compensation the company accounts for share based payments in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
asc requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense based on their fair value 
under this fair value recognition provision of asc  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
the company has applied the modified prospective method and expenses deferred stock based compensation on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the stock award 
we estimate the fair value of our grants made using the binomial method  which includes assumptions related to volatility  expected life  dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
we also award or sell restricted shares to our employees 
for restricted shares awarded or sold below market value  the accounting charge is measured at the grant date and amortized ratably as non cash compensation over the vesting term 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes payable in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our 
table of contents consolidated balance sheets 
fasb asc topic  income taxes asc  requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence  establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered 
we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three year period generally represent sufficient negative evidence to consider a valuation allowance under the provisions of asc as a result  we determined that certain of our deferred tax assets required the establishment of a valuation allowance 
the realization of the remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on forecasted future taxable income 
any reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income may require that we record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance has not previously been established 
the valuation allowance that has been established will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
an ongoing pattern of profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence 
our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance 
the establishment and reversal of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on our future earnings 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
predicting the outcome of such tax assessments involves uncertainty  however  we believe that recorded tax liabilities adequately account for our analysis of more likely than not outcomes 
new accounting principles in addition to the critical accounting policies discussed above  we adopted several new accounting policies during the past two years 
none of these new accounting principles had a material affect on our audited financial statements 
see note to our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein for a complete summary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed in note to our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended september   the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in market rates and prices  including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
as of september   other than as described below  there have been no material changes to the company s exposure to market risk since september  we have transactional exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar due to the global scope of our operations 
we use foreign exchange contracts  primarily to hedge the risk that unremitted or future royalties and license fees owed to our domestic companies for the sale  or anticipated sale  of us copyrighted products abroad may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we focus on managing the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our major currencies  which include the british pound sterling  euro  japanese yen  canadian dollar  swedish krona and australian dollar 
during the fiscal year ended september   the company entered into foreign exchange hedge contracts and  as of september   the company has outstanding hedge contracts for the sale of million and the purchase of million of foreign currencies at fixed rates 
subsequent to september   certain of our foreign exchange contracts expired and were renewed with new foreign exchange contracts with similar features 
the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the purpose of assessing the specific risks  we use a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair value of our financial instruments 
for foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at september   assuming a hypothetical depreciation of the u 
s dollar against foreign currencies from prevailing foreign currency exchange rates and assuming no change in interest rates  the fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would have decreased by million 
because our foreign exchange contracts are entered into for hedging purposes  these losses would be largely offset by gains on the underlying transactions 

table of contents we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our million principal amount of sterling denominated notes that were issued in april these sterling notes mature on april  as of september   these sterling notes had a fair value and carrying value of approximately million 
based on the principal amount of sterling denominated notes outstanding as of september  and assuming that all other market variables are held constant including the level of interest rates  a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar compared to the british pound sterling would not have an impact on the fair value of these sterling notes  since these notes are completely hedged as of september
