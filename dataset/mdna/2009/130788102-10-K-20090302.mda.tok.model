seasonal fluctuations our water business is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a material effect on customer usage 
customer demand for water generally is lower during the cooler and rainy  winter months 
demand increases in the spring when warmer weather returns and the rains end  and customers use more water for outdoor purposes  such as landscape irrigation 
warm temperatures during the generally dry summer months result in increased demand 
water usage declines during the fall as temperatures decrease and the rainy season begins 
during years in which precipitation is especially heavy or extends beyond the spring into the early summer  customer demand can decrease from historic normal levels  generally due to reduced outdoor water usage 
likewise  an early start to the rainy season during the fall can cause a decline in customer usage 
when summer temperatures are cooler than normal  water usage is generally lower 
a warmer than normal summer can result in higher customer usage 
in the past  the seasonality of water usage had a significant impact on operating revenues 
table of contents and net income 
in addition  the promotion of water conservation could also affect our operating revenues and net income 
during  cal water  after receiving california public utilities commission approval  changed its method of recognizing revenue and production costs with the adoption of the wram and mcba 
as a result  customer water usage does not have the same impact as in prior years 
this is discussed further in management s discussion and analysis 
drought can have an impact on the business 
when rainfall is below average for consecutive years  drought conditions can develop and certain customers may be required to reduce consumption to preserve available supply 
as an example  from to  california experienced a six year period when rainfall was below historic average 
during that period  some districts issued water rationing requirements to their customers 
in certain districts  penalties were assessed on customers who exceeded monthly allotments  which was approved by the cpuc after local governments enacted ordinances for drought 
during  the governor of california declared a drought emergency in the state and cal water s water wholesalers requested voluntary reduction in water usage 
on january   the california department of water resources indicated that the second snow survey of the winter season indicated that the snow content was percent of normal to date  statewide 
the financial impact of a drought  or of water rationing  has been minimized with the adoption of the wram and mcba 
water rationing will present us with challenges including changing our billing system to accommodate any penalty program  responding to customer requirements  and certain operational issues 
we are in the process of increasing our water conservation programs to promote water savings 
water supply in california  we obtain our water supply from wells  surface runoff or diversion  and by purchase from public agencies and other wholesale suppliers 
our water supply has been adequate to meet customer demand  however  during periods of drought  some districts have experienced mandatory water rationing 
california s rainy season usually begins in november and continues through march with the most rain typically falling in december  january and february 
during winter months  reservoirs and underground aquifers are replenished by rainfall 
snow accumulated in the mountains provides an additional water source when spring and summer temperatures melt the snowpack  producing runoff into streams and reservoirs  and also replenishing underground aquifers 
washington and hawaii receive rain in all seasons with the majority falling during winter months 
washington water and hawaii water draw all their water supply by pumping from wells 
historically  approximately half of cal water s water supply is purchased from wholesale suppliers with the balance pumped from wells 
during  approximately percent of the cal water supply was obtained from wells  percent was purchased from wholesale suppliers and percent was obtained from surface supplies 
well water is generally less expensive and cal water strives to maximize the use of its well sources in districts where there is an option between well or purchased supply sources 
new mexico water s rainfall normally occurs in all seasons  but is heaviest in the summer monsoon season 
new mexico water pumps all of its water supply from wells based on its water rights 
we have six california water treatment plants in the bakersfield  bear gulch  kernville  oroville and redwood valley districts 
water for operation of the bakersfield plants  with a combined capacity of million gallons per day  is drawn from the kern river under a long term contract with the city of bakersfield 
the other four plants have a capacity of million gallons per day 
during  we produced an estimated billion gallons of water for our customers  down from the estimated billion gallons produced in the average daily water production was approximately million gallons 
by comparison  in  the average daily water production was approximately million gallons 

table of contents the following table shows the estimated quantity of water purchased and the percentage of purchased water to total water production in each california operating district that purchased water in other than noted below  all other districts receive of their water supply from wells

in the oroville and redwood valley districts  the water purchased is from a surface supply 
the surface sources are processed through our water treatment plants before being delivered to the distribution system 
in the bakersfield and kern river valley districts  we purchase surface supply then process the water through our treatment plants 
in addition  the bakersfield district purchases treated water as a component of its water supply 
the chico  marysville  dixon  and willows districts in the sacramento valley  the salinas and king city districts in the salinas valley  and the selma and visalia districts in the san joaquin valley obtain their entire supply from wells 
in the salinas district  which solely depends upon ground water  several wells were taken out of service in the last three years  primarily due to poor water quality 
we have installed treatment systems on some of these wells to 
table of contents meet customer demand 
management believes that water supply issues in the salinas district will be adequately resolved in the future by seeking additional sources or additional treatment 
purchases for the los altos  livermore  oroville  redwood valley  stockton  and bakersfield districts are pursuant to long term contracts expiring on various dates after the water supplies purchased for the dominguez  east los angeles  hermosa redondo  palos verdes  and westlake districts  and the hawthorne and commerce systems are provided by public agencies pursuant to a statutory obligation of continued non preferential service to purveyors within the agencies boundaries 
purchases for the south san francisco  mid peninsula  and bear gulch districts are in accordance with long term contracts with the san francisco public utilities commission sfpuc expiring on june   which are in the process of renegotiation 
management anticipates that we will be able to renew each of the water supply contracts as they expire

utility plant construction we have continually extended  enlarged  and replaced our facilities as required to meet increasing demands and to maintain the water systems 
we obtain construction financing using funds from operations  short term bank borrowings  long term financing  advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction that are funded 
table of contents by developers 
advances for construction are cash deposits from developers for construction of water facilities or water facilities deeded from developers 
these advances are generally refundable without interest over a period of years by equal annual payments 
contributions in aid of construction consist of nonrefundable cash deposits or facilities transferred from developers  primarily for fire protection and relocation projects 
we cannot control the amount received from developers 
this amount fluctuates from year to year as the level of construction activity carried on by developers varies 
this activity is impacted by the demand for housing  commercial development  and general business conditions  including interest rates 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for additional information 
sale of surplus real properties when properties are no longer used and useful for public utility purposes  we are no longer allowed to earn a return on our investment in the property in the regulated business 
the surplus property is transferred out of the regulated operations 
from time to time  some properties have been sold or offered for sale 
as these sales are subject to local real estate market conditions and can take several months or years to close  income from the sale of surplus properties may or may not be consistent from year to year 
california energy situation the california energy crisis was well publicized 
there is still uncertainty about the state s ability to avoid future rolling electric blackouts  although we did not experience any major electric blackouts during or we continue to use power efficiently to minimize the power expenses passed on to our customers  and maintain backup power systems to continue water service to our customers if the power companies supplies are interrupted 
many of our well sites are equipped with emergency electric generators designed to produce electricity to keep the wells operating during power outages 
storage tanks also provide customers with water during blackout periods 
security at company facilities due to terrorist and other risks  we have heightened security at our facilities and have taken added precautions to protect our employees and the water delivered to customers 
in  federal legislation was enacted that resulted in new regulations concerning security of water facilities  including submitting vulnerability assessment studies to the federal government 
we have complied with regulations issued by the environmental protection agency epa pursuant to our federal legislation concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the epa as required 
in addition  communication plans have been developed as a component of our procedures 
while we do not make public comments on our security programs  we have been in contact with federal  state  and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve our water delivery systems security 
quality of water supplies our operating practices are designed to produce potable water in accordance with accepted water utility practices 
water entering the distribution systems from surface sources is treated in compliance with federal and state safe drinking water acts sdwa standards 
most well supplies are chlorinated or chloraminated for disinfection 
water samples from each water system are analyzed on a regular  scheduled basis in compliance with regulatory requirements 
we operate a state certified water quality laboratory at the san jose general office that provides testing for most of our california operations 
certain tests in california are contracted with independent certified labs qualified under the environmental laboratory accreditation program 
local independent state certified labs provide water sample testing for the washington  new mexico and hawaii operations 
in recent years  federal and state water quality regulations have continued to increase water testing requirements 
the sdwa continues to be amended to reflect new public health concerns 
we monitor water quality standard changes and upgrade our treatment capabilities to maintain compliance with the various regulations 

table of contents competition and condemnation our principal operations are regulated by the commission of each state 
under state laws  no privately owned public utility may compete within any service territory that we already serve without first obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the applicable commission 
issuance of such a certificate would only be made upon finding that our service is deficient 
to management s knowledge  no application to provide service to an area served by us has been made 
state law provides that whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend a utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility  such an act constitutes the taking of property and requires reimbursement to the utility for its loss 
state statutes allow municipalities  water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems 
these agencies are empowered to condemn properties already operated by privately owned public utilities 
the agencies are also authorized to issue bonds  including revenue bonds  for the purpose of acquiring or constructing water systems 
however  if a public agency were to acquire utility property by eminent domain action  the utility would be entitled to just compensation for its loss 
in washington  annexation was approved in february for property served by us on orcas island  however  we continue to serve the customers in the annexed area and do not expect the annexation to impact our operations 
to management s knowledge  other than the orcas island property  no municipality  water district  or other public agency is contemplating or has any action pending to acquire or condemn any of our systems 
in recent years  consolidation within the water industry has accelerated 
a number of publicly traded water companies have been acquired or merged into larger domestic companies 
several acquisitions of publicly traded companies have also been completed by much larger foreign companies 
we intend to continue the pursuit of opportunities to expand our business in the western united states  which may include expansion through acquisitions or mergers with other companies 
environmental matters our operations are subject to environmental regulation by various governmental authorities 
environmental affairs programs have been designed to provide compliance with water discharge regulations  underground and aboveground fuel storage tank regulations  hazardous materials management plans  hazardous waste regulations  air quality permitting requirements  wastewater discharge limitations and employee safety issues related to hazardous materials 
also  we actively investigate alternative technologies for meeting environmental regulations and continue the traditional practices of meeting environment regulations 
for a description of the material effects that compliance with environmental regulations may have on us  see item a 
risk factors risks related to our regulatory environment 
we expect environmental regulation to increase  resulting in higher operating costs in the future  which may have a material adverse effect on earnings 
employees at year end  we had employees  including at washington water  at new mexico water and at hawaii water 
in california  most non supervisory employees are represented by the utility workers union of america  afl cio  except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the international federation of professional and technical engineers  afl cio 
at december   there were union employees 
in november  we negotiated wage increases with both of our unions of 
the current agreement with the unions is effective through management believes that it maintains good relationships with the unions 
employees at washington water  new mexico water  and hawaii water are not represented by unions

risk factors 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our regulatory environment our business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to recover costs from our customers through rates that must be approved by state public utility commissions 
california water service company  new mexico water service company  washington water service company and hawaii water service company  inc  are regulated public utilities which provide water service to our customers 
the rates that we charge our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate 
these commissions set water rates for each operating district independently because the systems are not interconnected 
the commissions authorize us to charge rates which they consider to be sufficient to recover normal operating expenses  to provide funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure  and to allow us to earn what the commissions consider to be a fair and reasonable return on invested capital 
our revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to charge our customers by the commissions and our ability to recover our costs in these rates 
our management uses forecasts  models and estimates in order to set rates that will provide a fair and reasonable return 
table of contents on our invested capital 
while our rates must be approved by the commissions  no assurance can be given that our forecasts  models and estimates will be correct or that the commissions will agree with our forecasts  models and estimates 
if our rates are set too low  our revenues may be insufficient to cover our operating expenses  capital expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels 
we periodically file rate increase applications with the commissions 
the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly 
the decisions of the commissions are beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted by the commissions 
even if approved  there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment 
if the rate increase decisions are delayed  our earnings may be adversely affected 
our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such adjustment could adversely affect our results of operations 
regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and earnings  affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses 
our management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets  liabilities  and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and or reserves as deemed necessary 
under financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  we can defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs by future rate increases 
if a commission determined that a portion of our assets were not recoverable in customer rates  we may suffer an asset impairment which would require a write down in such asset s valuation which would be recorded through operations 
if our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is incorrect  the associated regulatory asset or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances 
a change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
regulatory agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of certain of our assets 
if we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for utility operations  we may remove them from our rate base and subsequently sell those assets 
if the commission disagrees with our characterization  we could be subjected to penalties 
furthermore  there is a risk that the commission could determine that appreciation in property value should be awarded to the ratepayers rather than our stockholders 
changes in laws  rules and policies of regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business 
regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for various reasons  including as a result of changes in the local political environment 
in some states  regulators are elected by popular vote or are appointed by elected officials  and the results of elections may change the rules and policies of an agency 
as a result of the political process  long established rules and policies of an agency can change dramatically 
for example  in regulation regarding recovery of increases in electrical rates changed in california 
for over years prior to  the california public utilities commission allowed recovery of electric rate increases under its operating rules 
however  in  the commission reinstated its policy to allow utilities to adjust their rates for rate changes by the power companies 
the original decision by the commission to change its policy  as well as its subsequent decision to reinstate that policy  affected our business 
we rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures  maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property  offset certain production and operating costs  recover the cost of debt  maintain an optimal equity structure without over leveraging  and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non regulated operations 
if any of the commissions with jurisdiction over us implement policies and regulations that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items listed above  our future operating results may be adversely affected 

table of contents in addition  legislatures may repeal  relax or tighten existing laws  or enact new laws that impact the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly 
if changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws limit our ability to accomplish some or all of our business objectives  our future operating results may be adversely affected 
we expect environmental regulation to increase  resulting in higher operating costs in the future 
our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations 
these provisions establish criteria for drinking water and for discharges of water  wastewater and airborne substances 
the environmental protection agency promulgates numerous nationally applicable standards  including maximum contaminant levels mcls for drinking water 
we believe we are currently in compliance with all of the mcls promulgated to date but we can give no assurance that we will continue to comply with all water quality requirements 
if we violate any federal or state regulations or laws governing health and safety  we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise sanctioned 
environmental laws are complex and change frequently 
they have tended to become more stringent over time 
as new or stricter standards are introduced  they could increase our operating costs 
although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases  we can give no assurance that the commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs 
we are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals and potential contaminants on a regular basis 
if the test results indicate that we exceed allowable limits  we may be required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant or to develop an alternate water source 
either of these results may be costly  and there can be no assurance that the commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs 
we are party to a toxic contamination lawsuit which could result in our paying damages not covered by insurance 
in  the state of california s department of toxic substances control dtsc named us as a potential responsible party for cleanup of a toxic contamination plume in the chico groundwater 
in december  we were named along with other defendants in two lawsuits filed by dtsc for the cleanup of the plumes 
the toxic spill occurred when cleaning solvents  which were discharged into the city s sewer system by local dry cleaners  leaked into the underground water supply 
the dtsc contends that our responsibility stems from our operation of wells in the surrounding vicinity that caused the contamination plumes to spread 
while we are cooperating with the clean up  we deny any responsibility for the contamination or the resulting cleanup 
in  the company entered into court approved consent decrees consent decrees 
the consent decrees conditioned the company s performance upon many factors  including  but not limited to  water pumped and treated by the company must meet regulatory standards so the company may distribute to its customers 
pursuant to the terms of the consent decrees  the company will incur capital costs of million and future operating costs with a present value of approximately million 
in its general rate case grc settlement negotiations  division of ratepayer advocates have tentatively agreed to track all costs associated with the consent decrees including legal costs to pursue insurance coverage for potential future recovery in rates 
in connection with these suits  our insurance carrier has filed a separate lawsuit against us for reimbursement of past defense costs which approximate million 
we believe that the insurance carrier has a duty to defend and is not entitled to any defense cost reimbursement 
furthermore  we believe that insurance coverage exists for the company s claims 
however  if our claim is ultimately found to be excludable under insurance policies  we may have to pay damages 
although we consider it probable that we will be able to recover amounts paid for damages through rate increases  we can give no assurance that we will be able to make such a recovery 
the number of environmental and product related lawsuits against other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent years 
if we are subject to additional environmental or product related lawsuits  we might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the legal costs from ratepayers or other third parties 
in addition  if current california law regarding california public utilities commission s 
table of contents preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for claims about compliance with california department of health services and united states environmental protection agency water quality standards changes  our legal exposure may be significantly increased 
risks related to our business operations wastewater operations entail significant risks 
while wastewater collection and treatment is not presently a major component of our revenues  wastewater collection and treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the surrounding environment 
if collection or treatment systems fail or do not operate properly  untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers  causing property damage or injury to aquatic life  or even human life 
liabilities resulting from such damage could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
demand for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by seasonal fluctuations 
demand for our water during the warmer  dry months is generally greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems  swimming pools  cooling systems and other outside water use 
throughout the year  and particularly during typically warmer months  demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels 
if temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal  or if there is more rainfall than normal  the demand for our water may decrease 
in addition  governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water  even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions 
however  during the drought of the late s and early s the california public utilities commission beginning in allowed us to surcharge our customers to collect lost revenues caused by customers conservation during the drought 
regardless of whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation period  they may use less water even after a drought has passed because of conservation patterns developed during the drought 
furthermore  our customers may wish to use recycled water as a substitute for potable water 
if rights are granted to others to serve our customers recycled water  there will likely be a decrease in demand for our water 
the adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors beyond our control 
interruption in the water supply may adversely affect our earnings 
we depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers 
whether we have an adequate supply varies depending upon a variety of factors  many of which are partially or completely beyond our control  including the amount of rainfall  the amount of water stored in reservoirs  underground water supply from which well water is pumped  changes in the amount of water used by our customers  water quality  legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions during a drought  and population growth 
we purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies and others 
water supply availability may be affected by weather conditions  funding and other political and environmental considerations 
in addition  our ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations 
if new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations  the availability of surface water may be materially reduced 
a reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources  thereby increasing our water production costs and adversely affecting our operating results 

table of contents we have entered into long term agreements  which commit us to payments whether or not we purchase any water 
therefore  if demand is insufficient to use our required purchases we would have to pay for water we did not receive 
from time to time  we enter into water supply contracts with third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements in order to meet regional demand 
for example  we have entered into a water supply contract with the san francisco public utilities commission which we rely upon 
we can give no assurance that the san francisco public utilities commission  or any of the other parties from whom we purchase water  will renew our contracts upon expiration  or that we will not be subject to significant price increases under any such renewed contracts 
the parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us 
maintenance of these facilities is beyond our control 
if these facilities are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise default on their obligations to supply water to us  we may not have adequate water supplies to meet our customers needs 
if we are unable to access adequate water supplies we may be unable to satisfy all customer demand which could result in rationing 
rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow from operations 
we can make no guarantee that we will always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all required quality standards 
water shortages may affect us in a variety of ways 
for example  shortages could adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water  adversely affect operating costs  increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our inability to maintain sufficient pressure  and increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply  new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water 
we may or may not be able to recover increased operating and construction costs on a timely basis  or at all  for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process 
although we can give no assurance  we may also be able to recover certain of these costs from third parties that may be responsible  or potentially responsible  for groundwater contamination 
changes in water supply costs impacts our operations the cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies depending on the sources of supply  wholesale suppliers prices and the quantity of water produced to supply customer water usage 
our source of supply varies by operating district 
certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells  some districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of well and purchased sources 
a portion of the supply is from surface sources and processed through company owned water treatment plants 
on average  slightly more than half of the water we deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or received from a surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale suppliers 
water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more than surface supplied or well pumped water 
during  the cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented of our total operating costs and in it represented of our total operating costs 
wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating costs 
purchased water rate increases are beyond our control 
in california  effective july   our ability to recover increases in the cost of purchased water changed with the adoption of the mcba 
with this change  any price increase will be recorded as an expense but also as revenue 
the balance in the mcba will be collected in the future 
there may be a short term impact to our cash flow from operations  but the impact to earnings has been minimized 
depending on the degree of heat and lack of rain and other factors that affect the adequacy of our water supply  we may have to purchase higher cost water to meet customer demand 

table of contents we depend upon an adequate supply of electricity and certain chemicals for the delivery of our water 
an interruption in the supply of these inputs or increases in their prices could adversely affect our results of operations 
we rely on purchased electrical power in order to operate the wells and pumps which are needed to supply water to our customers 
we have back up power generators to operate a number of our wells and pumps in emergencies  but an extended interruption in power supply could impact our ability to continue to supply water 
in the past  california has been subjected to rolling power blackouts due to insufficient power supplies 
we can give no assurance that we will not be subject to power blackouts in the future 
in addition  we require sufficient supplies of certain chemicals in order to treat the water which we supply 
there are multiple suppliers of these chemicals  but if we were to suffer an interruption of supply we might not be able to adequately treat our water 
purchased power expense represents electricity purchased to operate the wells and pumps 
purchased power is a significant operating expense 
during and  purchased power expense represented of our total operating costs 
these costs  which are beyond our control  can and do increase unpredictably 
these costs can also increase in substantial amounts  as occurred in california during when rates we paid for electricity increased 
cash flows between rate filings may be adversely affected until the commission authorizes a rate change 
we track the expense differences caused by the rate change as part of our mcba 
cost of chemicals used in the delivery of water is not an element of the mcba and therefore any variances in quantity or cost could impact our results of operations 
our ability to generate new operating contracts is affected by local politics 
our revenue growth depends upon our ability to generate new as well as to renew operating contracts with cities  other agencies and municipal utility districts 
because we are selling our services in a political environment  we are subject to changing trends and municipal preferences 
recent terrorist acts have affected some political viewpoints relative to outsourcing of water or wastewater utility services 
municipalities own and municipal employees operate the majority of water and wastewater systems 
a significant portion of our marketing and sales efforts is spent demonstrating the benefits of contract operations to elected officials and municipal authorities 
the existing political environment means that decisions are based on many factors  not just economic factors 
our business requires significant capital expenditures that are dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which we borrow increase  there would be a negative impact on our results of operations 
the water utility business is capital intensive 
we invest significant funds to add or replace property  plant and equipment 
in addition  water shortages may adversely affect us by causing us to rely on more purchased water 
this could cause increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to secure alternative water sources 
in addition  we require capital to grow our business through acquisitions 
we fund our short term capital requirements from cash received from operations and funds received from developers 
we also borrow funds from banks under short term bank lending arrangements 
we seek to meet our long term capital needs by raising equity through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt obligations 
we cannot give any assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return 
in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital  our expansion efforts could be curtailed  which may affect our growth and may affect our future results of operations 
our ability to access the capital markets is affected by the ratings of certain of our debt securities 
standard poor s rating agency issues a rating on california water service company s ability to repay certain debt obligations 
the credit rating agency could downgrade our credit rating based on reviews of our financial performance and projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could impact our business outlook 
standard poor s rating is a with a stable outlook 
lower ratings by the agency could restrict our ability to access equity and debt capital 
we can give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain ratings which allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions and at reasonable interest rates 
a future downgrade by the agency could also increase our cost of capital by causing potential investors to require a higher interest rate due to a perceived risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations 

table of contents while the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates  we do have interest rate exposure in our short term borrowings which have variable interest rates 
we are also subject to interest rate risks on new financings 
however  if interest rates were to increase on a long term basis  our management believes that customer rates would increase accordingly  subject to approval by the appropriate commission 
we can give no assurance that the commission would approve such an increase in customer rates 
we are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under certain of our loan and debt agreements 
failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing  and we could face increased borrowing costs  litigation  acceleration of maturity schedules  and cross default issues 
such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if the national and world wide financial crisis intensifies  potential disruptions in the financial and real estate markets may adversely affect our business  including by adversely affecting the availability and cost of short term funds for our liquidity requirements  our ability to meet long term commitments and our customers ability to pay for water  which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we rely on our current credit facilities to fund short term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from operations 
specifically  given the seasonal fluctuations in demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand is relatively low 
we also may occasionally use letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facilities 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets or further deterioration in the strength of financial institutions could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facilities 
our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of our bank to meet its funding commitments 
at present  our credit facilities are funded by a single bank 
our bank may not be able to meet its funding commitments to us if it experiences shortages of capital and liquidity or if it experiences excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time 
longer term disruptions in the financial markets as a result of uncertainty  changing or increased regulation  reduced capital raising alternatives  or failures of significant financial institutions or other factors could adversely affect our access to liquidity 
any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for business needs can be arranged 
such measures could include deferring capital expenditures  dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash 
many of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks that their ability to meet their payment and supply commitments are adversely affected by the worldwide financial crisis and recession in the united states and resulting potential disruptions in the financial and real estate markets 
we operate in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to declines in the price of real property and other consequences of the financial crisis  which could result in significant declines in demand for our products and services in certain of our districts 
in the event that any of our significant customers or suppliers  or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers  are adversely affected by these risks  we may face disruptions in supply  significant reductions in demand for our products and services  inability of customers to pay invoices when due  and other adverse effects that could negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
our operations and certain contracts for water distribution and treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local governments  and other municipal entities such as water districts 
major disruptions in the financial strength or operations of such entities  such as liquidity limitations  bankruptcy or insolvency  could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and or enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a party 
we are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock 
as a holding company  we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant assets are investments in those subsidiaries 
of our revenues are derived from the operations of california water service company 
as a result  we are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries  and california water service company in particular  to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock 

table of contents we can make dividend payments only from our surplus the excess  if any  of our net assets over total paid in capital or if there is no surplus  the net profits for the current fiscal year or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared 
in addition  we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become due 
owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared by our board of directors 
our board of directors can elect at any time  and for an indefinite duration  not to declare dividends on our capital stock 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on california water service group s debt or to provide california water service group with funds for dividends 
although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us  the reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their ratemaking determinations 
therefore  transfer of funds from our subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking determinations 
furthermore  our right to receive cash or other assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary 
if we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries in a timely manner we may be unable to meet our obligations or pay dividends 
an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems  including pursuant to operating agreements 
risks associated with potential acquisitions  divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect us 
we may seek to acquire or invest in other companies  technologies  services or products that complement our business 
the execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different risks than those associated with our utility operations 
we can give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive acquisition candidates or investments  or that we would be able to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties 
in addition  as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries  the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions 
if we are unable to find acquisition candidates or investments  our ability to grow may be limited 
acquisition and investment transactions may result in the issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in accordance with our business plan 
they may also result in significant write offs and an increase in our debt 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any of these transactions could involve numerous additional risks 
for example  we may incur one or more of the following problems integrating the acquired operations  personnel  technologies or products with our existing businesses and products  diversion of management time and attention from our core business to the acquired business  failure to retain key technical  management  sales and other personnel of the acquired business  difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business  and difficulty in getting required regulatory approvals 
in addition  the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the sales and profitability expected 
the occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered 

table of contents we may not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate  and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively 
we may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage future growth 
to successfully manage our growth and handle the responsibilities of being a public company  we believe we must effectively hire  train  integrate and manage additional qualified engineers for research and development activities  sales and marketing personnel  and financial and information technology personnel  retain key management and augment our management team  implement and improve additional and existing administrative  financial and operations systems  procedures and controls  expand and upgrade our technological capabilities  and manage multiple relationships with our customers  regulators  suppliers and other third parties 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  satisfy customer requirements  execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures 
we have a number of large volume commercial and industrial customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 
our revenues will decrease  and such decrease may be material  if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or materially reduces its use of our water 
approximately million  or of our water utility revenues was derived from business and industrial customers 
if any of our large business or industrial customers reduces or ceases its consumption of our water  we may seek commission approval to increase the rates of our remaining customers to offset decreased revenues 
there can be no assurance  however  that the commission would approve such a rate relief request  and even if it did approve such a request  it would not apply retroactively to the date of the reduction in consumption 
the delay between such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
our operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues 
our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon approval of such rate increases by state commissions  which may be inclined  for political or other reasons  to limit rate increases 
however  our costs are subject to market conditions and other factors  which may increase significantly 
the second largest component of our operating costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages 
these costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor 
other large components of our costs are general insurance  workers compensation insurance  employee benefits and health insurance costs 
these costs may increase disproportionately to rate increases authorized by state commissions and may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
our non regulated business operates in a competitive market 
while a majority of our business is regulated  our non regulated business participates in a competitive market 
we compete with several larger companies whose size  financial resources  customer base and technical expertise may restrict our ability to compete successfully for certain operations and maintenance contracts 
due to the nature of our contract operations business  and to the very competitive nature of the market  we must accurately estimate the cost and profitability of each project while  at the same time  maintaining prices at a level low enough to compete with other companies 
our inability to achieve this balance could adversely impact our results of operations 
demand for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our control 
we believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks  in part  because they seek reliable dividend payments 
if there is an over supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors  
table of contents the trading price of our securities could decrease 
additionally  if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities  demand for our stock  and consequently its market price  may also decrease 
the price of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future because of the volatility of the stock market and a variety of other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include regulatory developments  general economic conditions and trends  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time  actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations  actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts  actual or anticipated developments in our competitors businesses or the competitive landscape generally  litigation involving us or our industry  major catastrophic events or sales of large blocks of our stock 
equity markets in general have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of many companies have decreased substantially 
such price and volume fluctuations may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 
adverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension liability and pension funding requirements 
a substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan 
at present  the pension plan is underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets 
under applicable law  we are required to make cash contributions to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels imposed by regulatory requirements 
the amount of such required cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the plan 
the funded status of the plan can be affected by investment returns on plan assets  discount rates  mortality rates of plan participants  pension reform legislation and a number of other factors 
there can be no assurance that the value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover future liabilities 
although we have made contributions to our pension plan in recent years  it is possible that we could incur a pension liability adjustment  or could be required to make additional cash contributions to our pension plan  which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs 
work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our operating results 
at december   of our total employees were union employees 
most of our unionized employees are represented by the utility workers union of america  afl cio  except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the international federation of professional and technical engineers  afl cio 
in november we negotiated wage increases with both unions of we believe our labor relations are good  but in light of rising costs for healthcare and pensions  contract negotiations in the future may be difficult 
furthermore  changes in applicable law or regulations could have an adverse effect on management s negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized employees and or employees that decide to unionize in the future 
we are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as we negotiate with the unions to address these issues  which could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience work stoppages 
we depend significantly on the services of the members of our management team  and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer 
our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team 
the loss of the services of any member of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business as our management team has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace 

table of contents our operations are geographically concentrated in california and this lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations 
although we own facilities in a number of states  over of our operations are located in california 
as a result  we are largely subject to weather  political  water supply  labor  utility cost  regulatory and economic risks affecting california 
we are also affected by the real property market in california 
in order to grow our business  we may need to acquire additional real estate or rights to use real property owned by third parties  the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile in california relative to other states 
the value of our assets in california may decline if there is a decline in the california real estate market which results in a significant decrease in real property values 
in and we experienced an increases in uncollectible accounts  which  we believe  were attributable in part to the significant decline in real estate values  experienced by our customers in a number of our districts in california 
the effects of natural disasters  terrorist activity  pandemics  or poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may result in disruption in our services and litigation which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes  fires  mudslides and other natural disasters 
a significant seismic event in california  where our operations are concentrated  or other natural disaster in california could adversely impact our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations 
a major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital assets 
the california public utilities commission has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover costs 
however  we can give no assurance that the cpuc or any other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in the future 
our water supplies are subject to contamination  including contamination from the development of naturally occurring compounds  chemicals in groundwater systems  pollution resulting from man made sources  such as mtbe  sea water incursion and possible terrorist attacks 
if our water supply is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
if we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost effective manner  there may be an adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates 
we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage 
for example  private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 
our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims 
we operate a dam 
if the dam were to fail for any reason  we would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur 
whether or not we were responsible for the dam s failure  we could be sued 
we can give no assurance that we would be able to successfully defend such a suit 
in light of the threats to the nation s health and security ensuing in the wake of the september  terrorist attacks  we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply 
we have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business 
we have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities  operations and supplies 
these costs may be significant 
despite these tightened security measures  we may not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur 
we depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water delivery 
were a pandemic to occur  we can give no assurance that we would be able to maintain sufficient manpower to ensure uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve 

table of contents we retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies 
we evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually 
our evaluation considers the costs  risks and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage 
in addition  portions of our business are difficult or impracticable to insure 
furthermore  we are also affected by increases in prices for insurance coverage  in particular  we have been  and will continue to be  affected by rising health insurance costs 
retained risks are associated with deductible limits  partial self insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings 
if we suffer an uninsured loss  we may be unable to pass all  or any portion  of the loss on to customers because our rates are regulated by regulatory commissions 
consequently  uninsured losses may negatively affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained 
we rely on our information technology and a number of complex business systems that could malfunction and result in negative impacts on our profitability and cash flow 
our business is dependent on several complex business systems  certain of which are owned by third parties 
the business systems must function reliably in order for us to operate effectively 
among other things  system malfunctions and security breaches could prevent us from operating or monitoring our facilities  billing accurately and timely analysis of financial results 
our profitability and cash flow could be affected negatively in the event these systems do not operate effectively or are circumvented 
the accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition 
we make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding  among others the useful life of intangible rights  the number of years to depreciate certain assets  amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory obsolesces and uninsured losses  our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims  including medical claims and workers compensation claims  future costs for pensions and other post retirement benefits  and possible tax allowances 
the quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of the end of each accounting period 
if our estimates are not accurate  we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period 
accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts that include input cost changes to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the rates approved by the commissions 
these accounts result in expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in which they occurred 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates our internal control over financial reporting  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls and procedures  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could result in lack of compliance with contractual agreements  misstatements in our financial statements in amounts that could be material or could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  either of which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and may negatively affect our ability to raise future capital 

table of contents further  if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  the disclosure of that fact  even if quickly remedied  could reduce the market s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 
in addition  non compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions  including the suspension or delisting of our common stock from the new york stock exchange and the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common stock  which would further reduce our stock price 
we may be required to adopt international financial reporting standards ifrs  or other accounting or financial reporting standards  the ultimate adoption of which could negatively impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we could be required to adopt ifrs or other accounting or financial reporting standards different from gaap  which is currently applicable to our accounting and financial reporting 
in the sec released a timetable for the adoption of ifrs according to which we could be required to adopt ifrs by under gaap we are subject to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which  among other things  allows us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs by future rate increases 
currently  ifrs does not contain provisions equivalent to sfas no 
the implementation and adoption of new accounting or financial reporting standards could affect our reported performance  which in turn could favorably or unfavorably impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
furthermore  the transition to and application of new accounting or financial reporting standards could result in increased administrative costs 
municipalities  water districts and other public agencies may condemn our property by eminent domain action 
state statutes allow municipalities  water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems 
these agencies are empowered to condemn properties already operated by privately owned public utilities 
however  whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend a utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility  such an act constitutes the taking of property and requires reimbursement to the utility for its loss 
if a public agency were to acquire our utility property by eminent domain action  we would be entitled to just compensation for our loss  but we would no longer have access to the condemned property nor would we be entitled to any portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going forward

item legal proceedings 
chico groundwater wausau insurance matter in  the state of california s department of toxic substances control dtsc named us as a potential responsible party for cleanup of toxic contamination plumes  which contain perchloroethylene  also know as tetrachloroethylene pce in the chico groundwater 
in december  we were named along with other defendants in two lawsuits filed by dtsc for the cleanup of the plumes 
in  we entered into court approved consent decrees consent decrees 
the consent decrees conditioned our performance upon many factors  including  but not limited to  water pumped and treated by us must meet regulatory standards so we may distribute to its customers 
pursuant to the terms of the consent decrees  we will incur capital costs of million and future operating costs with a present value of approximately million 
in our general rate case grc settlement negotiations  division of ratepayer advocates have tentatively agreed to track all costs associated with the consent decrees  including legal costs to pursue insurance coverage  for potential future recovery in rates 
in connection with these suits  our insurance carrier  employers insurance of wausau wausau filed a separate lawsuit against us for reimbursement of past defense costs which approximate million and a declaratory determination of coverage 
on january   the court heard various parties motions and on september  issued its rulings that wausau had a duty to defend  therefore  the company will not have to reimburse wausau for previously incurred defense costs 
the court did not find wausau s actions were intended to harm the company  so punitive damages will not be recoverable by the company 
however  the court also found that the issue of policy coverage will be determined at trial 
a trial date has been set for may  based on the court s rulings  the company has not recorded any liability associated with reimbursement of costs to defend and expensing the related costs as incurred 
we continue to believe that the claims are covered under the insurance policies 
however  if our claim is ultimately found to be excludable under the insurance policies  the company believes that recovery of costs associated with the consent decrees are probable from either its equitable indemnity lawsuit against manufacturers and distributors of perchloroethylene  also know as tetrachloroethylene  pce in california  or through rate increases in the future 
therefore  no accrual or contingency has been recorded for this matter 
other groundwater contamination the company has been and is involved in litigation against third parties to recover past and future costs related to ground water contamination in our service areas 
the cost of litigation is expensed as incurred and any settlement is first offset against such costs 
any settlement in excess of the cost to litigate is accounted for on a case by case basis based upon the nature of the settlement 
it is anticipated that the majority of the settlement will be reflected as a benefit to the rate payers by offsetting future operating or capital costs 
the company is involved in a lawsuit against major oil refineries regarding the contamination of the ground water as a result of the gas additive mtbe 
the company entered into a partial settlement with the defendants in april of that represent approximately of the responsible parties as determined by the superior court 
based on the allocation matrix  on october   the company received million after deducting attorneys 
table of contents fees and litigation expenses 
the company is aggressively pursuing legal action against the remaining responsible parties 
the company is in the process of determining with the commission the appropriate regulatory treatment of the proceeds 
it is anticipated that the proceeds will be used by the company on infrastructure improvements 
the company is in the process of filing with the internal revenue service a request for a private letter ruling regarding the taxability of the proceeds 
as of december   the company believes the proceeds are non taxable based upon its intent to reinvest them in qualifying assets 
in  when an agreement is reached with the commission regarding the regulatory treatment  or when the taxability is determined based upon proceedings with the internal revenue service  the company will adjust the accounting of the settlement accordingly

the complaint states negligence  false representations  strict liability  premise owner liability and loss of consortium causes of actions 
the complaint does not state any amount of damages 
the company does not believe that the plaintiffs have any valid causes of actions against the company 
the company will vigorously defend itself in this matter 
accordingly  the company has not recorded an accrual for this matter 
from time to time  the company is involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount of the range of loss can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with sfas no  accounting of contingencies 
legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties  and the outcomes are difficult to predict 
because of such uncertainties  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
while the outcome of these disputes and litigation matters cannot be predicted with any certainty  management does not believe that when taking into account existing reserves that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

the new employees scheduled in the grc were to implement new programs and for administrative positions required for a company our size  additional engineering staff to work on the design of capital projects  and additional field positions that have not kept up with the customer growth in some of our districts 
the new programs include  among other things  a routine flushing program and a management training program and other programs needed to maintain and account for our operations 
all of the personnel positions in the grc went through a rigorous justification process and we are in the process of hiring for those positions 
therefore we anticipate that once the employees are hired there will be an increase in operating expenses 
in addition the grc includes recovery of certain conservation expenses 
these costs have begun to be incurred and we anticipate the level of expense to increase to match what is included in rates 
we plan to continue to seek rate relief to recover our operating cost increases and receive reasonable returns on invested capital 
we expect to fund our long term capital needs through a combination of debt  common stock offerings  and cash flow from operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates we maintain our accounting records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and as directed by the commissions to which our operations are subject 
the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management 
the estimates used by management are based on historic experience and an understanding of current facts and circumstances 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is listed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following sections describe those policies where the level of subjectivity  judgment  and variability of estimates could have a material impact on the financial condition  operating performance  and cash flows of the business 
revenue recognition revenue includes monthly cycle customer billings for regulated water and wastewater services at rates authorized by regulatory commissions and billings to certain non regulated customers at rates authorized by contract with government agencies 
revenue from metered customers includes billings to customers based on monthly meter readings plus an estimate for water used between the customer s last meter reading and the end of the accounting period 
as of december  and  our unbilled revenue amount was million and million  respectively 
the unbilled revenue amount is generally higher during the summer months when water sales are higher 
flat rate customers are billed in advance at the beginning of the service period 
the revenue is prorated so that the portion of revenue applicable to the current accounting period is included in that period s revenue  with the balance recorded as unearned revenue on the balance sheet and recognized as revenue when earned in the subsequent accounting period 
our unearned revenue liability was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
this liability is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents effective july   cal water is operating under a water rate adjustment mechanism wram approved in february by the california public utilities commission cpuc 
under the wram  cal water records the adopted level of volumetric revenues as established by the cpuc for metered accounts adopted volumetric revenues 
in addition to volumetric based revenues  the revenue requirements approved by the cpuc include service charges  flat rate charges  and other items not subject to the wram 
the adopted volumetric revenue considers the seasonality of consumption of water based upon historical averages 
the variance between adopted volumetric revenues and actual billed volumetric revenues for metered accounts is recorded as a component of revenue with an offsetting entry to a current asset or liability balancing account tracked individually for each cal water district 
the variance amount may be positive or negative and represents amounts that will be billed or refunded to customers in the future 
also effective july   cal water is operating under a modified cost balancing account mcba 
we track authorized expense levels for purchased water  purchased power and pump taxes  as established by the cpuc 
variances which include the effects of changes in both rate and volume between adopted and actual purchased water  purchased power  and pump taxes expenses will be recorded as a component of revenue  as the amount of such variances will be recovered from or refunded to our customers at a later date 
any recovery or refund of the mcba would be netted against the wram revenue over or under recovery for the corresponding district 
the monthly balances accrue interest payable or receivable based upon the day commercial paper rate 
the balances in the wram and mcba assets and liabilities will fluctuate on a monthly basis depending upon the level of variance between adopted and actual results 
when the net amount for any district achieve a pre determined level at the end of any calendar year ie  at least percent over or under recovery of the approved revenue requirement  cal water will seek approval from the commission to refund or collect the balance in the accounts 
account balances less than those levels may be refunded or collected in cal water s general rate case proceedings or aggregated with future calendar year balances for comparison with the recovery level 
as of december   the net aggregated asset is million and the aggregate liability is million and are included in other accounts receivable and accounts payable  respectively 
expense balancing and memorandum accounts the company has historically used expense balancing accounts also referred as incremental cost balancing accounts icba and memorandum accounts to track only suppliers rate changes for purchased water  purchased power  and pump taxes that are not included in customer water rates 
the cost changes were referred to as off setable expenses because under certain circumstances they were refundable from customers or refunded to customers in future rates designed to offset cost changes from suppliers 
the balancing and memorandum accounts have not been recorded until the cpuc has authorized a change in customer rates and the customer has been billed 
the cumulative net amount in the expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts as of december   was approximately million 
this amount includes certain amounts that have been authorized for recovery through customer surcharges but which have not yet been collected and amounts that have not yet been filed for recovery 
see rates and regulations below for descriptions of amounts included in this total that have been authorized for recovery 
modified cost balancing accounts with the implementation of the wram  the existing icba expense balancing accounts will be replaced by modified cost balancing accounts mcba described above 
the mcba will be recorded on the company s books 
the existing icba and the memorandum accounts will not be transferred to the wram mcba balances 
additions and other adjustments to these balances ended on july  however  interest will continue to accumulate on these balances until they are fully amortized through customer billings 
washington water  new mexico water  and hawaii water do not have any material amounts in expense balancing or memorandum accounts 

table of contents regulated utility accounting because we operate extensively in a regulated business  we are subject to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
regulators establish rates that are designed to permit the recovery of the cost of service and a return on investment 
based upon past practices and decisions by the commissions  we assess the probability of future recovery from rate payers of certain items  including the probability of return of amounts collected to rate payers 
if it is probable that rates will recover an item in the future  a regulatory asset will be reported 
if it is probable that rates will reflect a reduction in future rates for an item  a regulatory liability will be reported 
we assess the probability of recovery of the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities in each reporting period 
in addition  if a regulatory commission determined that a portion of our assets used in utility operations were not recoverable in customer rates  we would be required to determine if we had suffered an asset impairment that would require a write down in the assets valuation 
there have been no such asset impairments as of december  or december  income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate in the period that includes the enactment date 
we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered in future taxable income and  to the extent recovery is unlikely  a valuation allowance would be recorded 
if a valuation allowance were required  it could significantly increase income tax expense 
in management s view  a valuation allowance was not required at december  or december  we anticipate that future rate action by the regulatory commissions will reflect revenue requirements for the tax effects of temporary differences recognized  which have previously been passed through to customers 
the regulatory commissions have granted us rate increases to reflect the normalization of the tax benefits of the federal accelerated methods and available investment tax credits itcs for all assets placed in service after itcs are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related properties for book purposes 
pension benefits we incur costs associated with our pension and postretirement health care benefits plans 
to measure the expense of these benefits  our management must estimate compensation increases  mortality rates  future health cost increases and discount rates used to value related liabilities and to determine appropriate funding 
different estimates used by our management could result in significant variances in the cost recognized for pension benefit plans 
the estimates used are based on historical experience  current facts  future expectations  and recommendations from independent advisors and actuaries 
we use an investment advisor to provide advice in managing the plan s investments 
we anticipate any increase in funding for the pension and postretirement health care benefits plans will be recovered in future rate filings  thereby mitigating the financial impact 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans an amendment of fasb statement nos 
  and r 
we adopted sfas no 
as of december  which required the full recognition of the projected benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets  reflecting the funded status of the benefit plans  on the balance sheet 
we believe it is probable that future costs will be recovered in future rates and therefore have recorded a regulatory asset in accordance with sfas workers compensation  general liability  and other claims we are self insured for a portion of workers compensation and general liability claims 
excess amounts are covered by insurance policies 
for workers compensation  we work with an independent actuary firm to estimate the discounted liability associated with claims submitted and claims not yet submitted based on historical data 
these estimates could vary significantly from actual claims paid  which could impact earnings and cash flows 
for 
table of contents general liability claims and other claims  management estimates the cost incurred but not yet paid using historical information 
actual costs could vary from these estimates 
management believes actual costs incurred would be allowed in future rates  mitigating the financial impact 
contingencies we did not record any provisions relating to the contingencies reported in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  as these did not qualify for recording under sfas no 
or other accounting standards 
if management s assessment is incorrect  these items could have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
results of operations earnings net income in was million compared to million in and million in diluted earnings per common share were in  in  and in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in the diluted earnings per share calculation was  in   in  and  in the increase in earnings per share resulted from increased operating income  largely driven by rate increases 
offsetting the increase in revenues were decline in other income as a result of a decline in value of investment assets  amortization of certain start up costs of our operations on the island of hawaii not covered by rates and no significant property sales this year compared with the prior year 
dividends at the january meeting  the board of directors declared the quarterly dividend  increasing it for the nd consecutive year 
the quarterly dividend was raised from to per common share  or an annual rate of per common share 
dividends have been paid for consecutive years 
the annual dividends paid per common share in   and were   and  respectively

however  with the adoption of the wram and mcba on july   the impact of weather on revenue has been minimized 
in  rate relief increased revenues by million 
this was a record increase as a significant portion of our corporate costs received rate recovery from all districts effective july  rather than a phased in approach of prior years regulatory treatment 
see the rates and regulation section of this report for more information on regulatory activity occurring in   and through february  
table of contents the number of customers in increased by  or an increase of over levels 
this increase includes customers in new mexico   customers in hawaii  customers in washington  and a decline of customers in california

for the million increase in purchased water is due to a increase in quantities purchased and wholesale water rate increases of between and  for  the million increase in purchased water costs is due to a increase in quantities purchased  magnified by overall higher wholesale water rates 
on an overall blended basis  wholesale water rates increased on a cost per million gallon basis in purchased power expenses are affected by the quantity of water pumped from wells and moved through the distribution system  rates charged by electric utility companies  and rate structures applied to usage during peak and non peak times of the day or season

the largest increase in this category is the cost of labor and outside services for water treatment and water quality testing  which increased by million  or 
the other major increase is due to additional provision for uncollectible accounts  which increased million  or over the prior year 
we believe that the slow down of the economy and the increase in foreclosures of homes is the most important cause of the increase in other operations expenses 
other causes elements contributed to the balance of the increase  but none were individually significant

the effective tax rate was   and in   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate was affected by the benefit from an additional tax deduction for the qualified production activity deduction for income attributed to the production of water 
the tax rate is also affected by the flow through method of accounting for income taxes which resulted from differences between tax depreciation and book depreciation on both pre assets  as well as all california assets 
the flow through method of accounting is described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate the reversal of federal tax depreciation on pre assets to continue in future years  however  its effect on our tax provision is uncertain due to the offsetting flow through of state tax depreciation  which continues to increase with capital additions and the impact of cost to remove of pre assets 
property and other taxes for  expenses increased million  or  compared to for  expenses increased million  or over levels 
the increase in both years is due primarily to increased local franchise tax  which is based upon revenue and property taxes  which is based primarily upon our utility plant in service

rates and regulation the state regulatory commissions have plenary powers setting rates and operating standards 
as such  state commission decisions significantly impact our revenues  earnings  and cash flows 
the amounts discussed herein are generally annual amounts  unless specifically stated  and the financial impact to recorded revenue is expected to occur over a month period from the effective date of the decision 
in california  water utilities are required to make several different types of filings 
most filings result in rate changes that remain in place until the next general rate case grc 
as explained below  surcharges and surcredits to recover balancing and memorandum accounts as well as general rate case interim rate catch up surcharges are temporary rate changes  which have specific time frames for recovery 
grcs  escalation rate increase filings  and offset filings change rates to amounts that will remain in effect until the next grc 
the cpuc follows a rate case plan  which requires cal water to file a grc for each of its regulated operating districts every three years 
in a grc proceeding  the cpuc not only considers the utility s rate setting requests  but may also consider other issues that affect the utility s rates and operations 
effective in  cal water s grc schedule was shifted from a calendar year to a fiscal year with test years commencing on july st of each year 
the cpuc is generally required to issue its grc decision prior to the first day of the test year or authorize interim rates 
as such  cal water s grc decisions  prior to  were generally issued in the fourth quarter  and from through were generally issued in the third quarter 
in accordance with the rate case plan  the commission would issue a decision on cal water s general rate case filing in the fourth quarter of with rates effective on january  a decision on the eight grcs filed in july of was delayed beyond july  as required by state law  the cpuc authorized interim rates incorporating the last twelve months change in cpi 
a final decision on the grc was made on july  with final rates billed effective on july  a provision in the final decision allows recovery of the revenue lost due to the delay over a twelve month period beginning in the fourth quarter of between grc filings utilities may file escalation rate increases  which allow the utility to recover cost increases  primarily from inflation and incremental investment  during the second and third years of the rate case cycle 
however  escalation rate increases are subject to a weather normalized earnings test 
under the earnings test  the cpuc may reduce the escalation rate increase if  in the most recent twelve month period  this earnings test reflects earnings in excess of authorized for that district 
in addition  utilities are entitled to file offset filings 
offset filings may be filed to adjust revenues for construction projects authorized in grcs when the plant is placed in service or for rate changes charged to the company for purchased water  purchased power  and pump taxes referred to as offsettable expenses 
such rate changes approved in offset filings remain in effect until a grc is approved 
surcharges and surcredits to amortize balances in the wram and mcba accounts  which are interest bearing  will be made in march of each year based on the district balances for the last calendar year 
surcharges will be for twelve months 
in the event the combined wram and mcba balance for a district is less than of revenue  the amount will not be amortized at that time 
the wram and mcba amounts are cumulative  so if they are not amortized in a given calendar year  the balance will be rolled forward and reviewed with the following year balance

rate case plan in december  the cpuc issued the california water action plan 
the plan focuses on four key principles  among other things  including safe  high quality water  highly reliable water supplies  efficient use of water  and reasonable rates and viable utilities 
in accordance with the water action plan s objective to streamline regulatory decision making the cpuc issued r 
in december  to address streamlining of its water rate case plan 
the cpuc issued d 
on may  adopting a new rate case plan 
as a result  cal water will be filing a company wide general rate case every three years beginning in july rates would be effective approximately months from the filing date or january  in the first cycle 
as an interim measure  the cpuc allowed cal water to incorporate general operations costs including company benefits in rates for all districts in july after a decision in its general rate case 
in addition  for the sixteen districts that have a delayed effective date  the cpuc will authorize interim rates from the authorized effective date under the old rate case plan 
these interim rates will be subject to adjustment based on a final determination in the general rate case filing 
in addition to general rate case processing  the rcp set a schedule for separate cost of capital applications 
under the rcp  cal water must file its cost of capital application every three years 
the first application under this procedure was made on may  cal water s cost of capital application was consolidated with applications of two other multi district class a water utilities into a combined proceeding 
conservation application decision directed cal water to file an application to implement conservation rates and a sales decoupling mechanism 
on october   cal water filed application requesting a water revenue balancing account  a conservation memorandum account  and conservation rates 
this request was consolidated with applications filed by other water companies in the cpuc s order instituting investigation on june   cal water and two consumer groups the commission s division of ratepayer advocates dra and the utility reform network turn filed a settlement jointly proposing a program of tiered residential rates  a water revenue adjustment mechanism wram  and a modified balancing account mcba that includes changes in source mix 
tiered rates have varying charges depending on the overall monthly usage 
they are intended to provide a conservation incentive  particularly in high usage periods 
non residential rate design under the settlement emphasizes variable charges over service charges 
the wram and mcba are intended to negate any impact from customer conservation on cal water s earnings 
on february   the commission adopted the settlement 
on july   cal water made its tiered rates  wram  and mcba effective in compliance with the commission s administrative processing rules 
the submitted tariffs were administratively approved in the third quarter  effective july  in the conservation proceeding  the commission also sought to examine the effect of sales decoupling on appropriate return on equity 
on august   the commission issued its decision declining to make 
table of contents a specific return on equity adjustment and ordering that the issue be considered in connection with the cost of capital applications filed on may  the conservation proceeding is still open to examine the commission s non rate related conservation policies 
we are unable to predict the outcome of the proceeding with respect to these matters at this time 
regulatory activity cost of capital application on may   as required under the rate case plan  cal water filed application requesting a review of its authorized rate of return 
cal water requested a rate of return on rate base of reflecting a return on common equity verses the current return on common equity previously approved by the cpuc 
if cal water s proposal is adopted  rates would increase million annually or 
in september  the commission held three days of evidentiary hearings on the applications of cal water  golden state water company  and california american water company 
the commission s division of ratepayer advocates is the only other participating party in the proceeding 
all parties filed opening and reply briefs in october  an administrative law judge has issued a draft decision which will be considered by the commission in the first quarter of as the cost of capital was a contested matter  cal water cannot predict whether or when this application would change rates  or the magnitude of any potential changes 
grc filing on july   cal water filed its grc application covering eight districts and general office costs 
on july   the cpuc approved a settlement between cal water and the division of ratepayer advocates  and authorized annual rate increases for eight districts of million 
in its order  the cpuc allowed cal water to file immediately to recover its increased general costs in all other districts 
as of october   cal water had made effective million of additional rate increases in fifteen districts 
the cpuc order also allows for additional rate increases  including escalation increases  which may be requested in and  and offset increases after construction of certain large capital projects 
in accordance with state law  cal water will also be allowed to recover the difference between interim rates authorized on july  and final rates approved on july  pbop application in december  cal water filed an application to allow it to recover additional funding associated with its postretirement benefit other than pensions pbop or retiree healthcare plan 
for the period through  cal water funded and recognized as its pbop expense at the internal revenue code s irc maximum tax deductible contribution level maximum contribution level using an irc h account as the funding mechanism 
the excess expense between the maximum contribution level and fas accrual during the employees expected service period was recorded as a regulatory asset 
as of december   the regulatory asset was approximately million 
on march   the commission issued d  which granted cal water s request to amortize the million regulatory asset over a fifteen year period 
cal water began a rate surcharge on april  which is expected to collect annually to recover the regulatory asset 
the annual amortization is included in the general allocated costs approved by the commission in its d  replacing the prior adopted surcharge 
in  cal water established two voluntary employee beneficiary associations vebas to allow for increased funding  which also permit a current period income tax deduction 
cal water intends to increase its funding  so the pbop plan accrual is fully funded each year during the employee s service period 
other regulatory proceedings in december  cal water received a decision on its general rate case filing 
the decision allowed an increase of million in rates for eight districts 
this increase is inclusive of the million in interim rates approved in july as a result  in december cal water filed advice letters to implement the adopted rates in january these advice letters were approved effective in january as requested 

table of contents in january  cal water filed advice letters to offset million of increased purchased water and pump tax rates in six of its regulated districts 
these advice letters were approved effective in january as requested

under cpuc advice letter processing rules  cal water charges the rates in compliance advice letters to its customers upon filing 
these advice letters were approved effective in february as requested 
the lost revenue will be recovered as a surcharge on customer bills for a twelve month period beginning in february in june  cal water filed an offset advice letter to increase rates by million in one district to recover the capital requirements for a water treatment and supply project 
the commission had authorized recovery for this project in d 
in august under the commission s administrative processing rules  commission approval was required 
on september   the commission approved resolution w  which adopted these changes

these filings were approved effective in august as requested 
in august  cal water filed advice letters to offset increases in purchased water and pump tax charges in two districts totaling million in annual revenue 
these advice letters were approved effective in august as requested 
however  expense offsets are dollar for dollar increases in revenue to match increased expenses and interact with the wram and mcba mechanisms so that net operating revenue is not affected by an offset increase 
in october  cal water filed a request to recover million in lost revenue due to the delay in approving the general rate case increases from july  until july  the recovery is through a temporary month surcharge on all affected customers 
this advice letter was approved in november as requested 
regulatory activity to date in january and february  cal water filed advice letters to offset increased purchased water and pump tax rates in seven of its regulated districts totaling million in annual revenue 
under cpuc advice letter processing rules  cal water charges the rates in expense offset advice letters to its customers upon filing 
these rates are subject to refund until approved by the cpuc staff 
while these offsets have not been approved as of february   cal water expects that they will be approved and effective as filed 
however  expense offsets are dollar for dollar increases in revenue to match increased expenses and interact with the wram and mcba mechanisms so that net operating revenue is not affected by an offset increase 
in january the city of hawthorne approved cal water s requested rate increase for its leased water system 
the increase will take effect in phases  with a million annual increase in february  a million annual increase in july  and a million annual increase in january in january cal water filed an application to the cpuc for approvals and consents related to an anticipated secured debt offering 
the application includes  among other things  requests for i a waiver of a cpuc policy  which would allow debt offerings by cal water of up to million in principal amount be conducted through a single underwriter and ii clarification that complying with the terms of the indenture for the outstanding unsecured notes by granting the holders a first mortgage security interest upon the issuance of additional first mortgage debt does not use any of the cal water s previously used financing authorization 
throughout the calendar year  cal water plans to file advice letters to offset expected increases in purchased water and pump tax charges in some districts 
cal water cannot predict the exact timing or dollar amount of the changes 
however  expense offsets are dollar for dollar increases in revenue to match increased expenses and interact with the wram and mcba mechanisms so that net operating revenue is not affected by an offset increase 

table of contents in april  as allowed in the commission s rate case plan  cal water intends to file advice letters for interim rate increases for eight districts effective in july under the commission s prior rate case plan  these districts would have had rates effective in july the interim rate changes will be adjusted once the commission has issued a determination in cal water s grc  expected in the fourth quarter of in may  cal water intends to file for step rate increases effective in july for sixteen districts 
the cpuc s current practice on approving step rate increases is based partly on inflation through march inputs to the weather adjusted earnings test include recorded information through march therefore  cal water does not know the amount of its request at this time 
in july  cal water is required to file a grc covering all regulated districts and general expenses 
cal water expects the cpuc to issue a decision in the proceeding in the fourth quarter of with rates effective in january cal water cannot predict the magnitude of any potential rate changes at this time 
water supply our source of supply varies among our operating districts 
certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells  some districts purchase all of their supply from wholesale suppliers  and other districts obtain supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers 
a small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through company owned water treatment plants 
to the best of management s knowledge  we are meeting water quality  environmental  and other regulatory standards for all company owned systems 
california s normal weather pattern yields little precipitation between mid spring and mid fall 
the washington water service areas receive precipitation in all seasons  with the heaviest amounts during the winter 
new mexico water s rainfall is heaviest in the summer monsoon season 
hawaii water receives precipitation throughout the year  with the largest amounts in the winter months 
water usage in all service areas is highest during the warm and dry summers and declines in the cool winter months 
rain and snow during the winter months replenish underground water aquifers and fill reservoirs  providing the water supply for subsequent delivery to customers 
to date  snowpack water content and rainfall accumulation during the water year is of normal as of january  per the california department of water resources 
precipitation in the prior year was below average 
management believes that supply pumped from underground aquifers and purchased from wholesale suppliers will be adequate to meet customer demand during and beyond 
however  water rationing may be required in  if declared by the state or local jurisdictions 
long term water supply plans are developed for each of our districts to help assure an adequate water supply under various operating and supply conditions 
some districts have unique challenges in meeting water quality standards  but management believes that supplies will meet current standards using current treatment processes 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations during we generated cash flow from operations of approximately million  compared to million during  and million in cash flow from operations is primarily generated by net income and non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes 
cash generated by operations varies during the year 
the water business is seasonal 
billed revenue is lower in the cool  wet winter months when less water is used compared to the warm  dry summer months when water use is highest 
this seasonality results in the possible need for short term borrowings under the bank lines of credit in the event cash is not sufficient to cover operating and capital costs during the winter period 
the increase in cash flow during the summer allows short term borrowings to be paid down 
customer water usage can be lower than normal in years when more than normal precipitation falls in our service areas or temperatures are lower than normal  especially in the summer months 
the reduction in water usage reduces cash flow from operations and increases the need for short term bank borrowings 
in addition  short term borrowings are used to finance capital expenditures until long term financing is arranged 

table of contents investing activities during we used million of cash for company funded capital expenditures and million for acquisitions of new systems 
capital expenditures were budgeted at approximately million 
at december   we had accrued payables of million related to company funded capital projects 
developer funded cash capital expenditures were in compared to million in developer funded projects vary year to year based upon housing markets in our service area 
included in investing activities was the receipt of million from our mtbe litigations 
we are currently reviewing the regulatory treatment with the cpuc and are in process of filing a request for a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service regarding the tax treatment 
while we have not yet determined the final accounting treatment of the proceeds  we anticipate using the proceeds on infrastructure improvements 
financing activities during there were no debt or equity offerings 
dividend payments were higher in from the prior year due to additional shares outstanding and a higher dividend rate in in august we redeemed and cancelled all outstanding shares of our series c preferred stock 
short term financing short term liquidity is provided by credit facilities extended to us and certain of our subsidiaries and by internally generated funds 
long term financing is accomplished through use of both debt and equity 
short term bank borrowings were million at december   and zero at december  cash and cash equivalents were million at december   and million at december  given our ability to access our lines of credit on a daily basis  cash balances are managed to levels required for daily cash needs and excess cash is invested in short term or cash equivalent instruments 
minimal operating levels of cash are maintained for washington water  new mexico water  and hawaii water 
cal water has a million credit facility agreement that expires april  with bank of america 
the agreement requires debt as a percent of total capitalization to be less than  and an interest coverage ratio of at least as of december   we have met all covenant requirements and are eligible to use the full amount of the commitment 
on september   the cal water line of credit was amended to allow borrowings up to million for the period between september  and march  the amendment also provided that at any time the borrowings under the revolving credit facility exceed million the entire principal amount outstanding of the revolving facility will bear interest annually at the lender s prime rate minus percentage points or alternatively at libor plus percentage points 
if the borrowings do not exceed million the original interest provisions will apply 
in addition to borrowings  the credit facility allows for letters of credit up to million  which reduces the available amount to borrow when utilized 
one letter of credit was outstanding at december   for million related to an insurance policy 
interest is charged on a variable basis and fees are charged for unused amounts 
a separate credit facility also with bank of america  for million also exists for use by the company and its subsidiaries  including washington water  new mexico water  and hawaii water 
in addition to borrowings  the credit facility allows for letters of credit up to million  which would reduce the amount available to borrow 
no letters of credit were outstanding at december  interest is charged on a variable basis and fees are charged for unused amounts 
credit ratings cal water s first mortgage bonds are rated by standard poor s s p 
since  the credit rating agency has maintained their rating of a and characterized us as stable 
in the past  the credit agency has been concerned over the rate setting process and decisions by the cpuc 
also  concerns were raised about our present level of capital expenditures  which will need to be partially financed through long term borrowings or equity offerings 
management believes we would be able to meet financing needs even if ratings were downgraded  but a rating change could result in a higher interest rate on new debt 

table of contents long term financing long term financing  which includes senior notes  other debt securities  and common stock  has been used to replace short term borrowings and fund capital expenditures 
internally generated funds  after making dividend payments  provide positive cash flow  but have not been at a level to meet the needs of our capital expenditure requirements 
management expects this trend to continue given our capital expenditures plan for the next years 
some capital expenditures are funded by payments received from developers for contributions in aid of construction or advances for construction 
funds received for contributions in aid of construction are non refundable  whereas funds classified as advances in construction are refundable 
management believes long term financing is available to meet our cash flow needs through issuances in both debt and equity markets 
in september  the cpuc issued a decision granting cal water authority to complete up to million of equity and debt financing through  subject to certain restrictions 
following our issuance of million of common stock in  of which million was contributed to cal water  cal water has approximately million of authorized equity and debt financing that it can complete through without seeking further authorization from the cpuc 
during  we raised approximately million of capital 
of this amount  million was raised through privately placed senior unsecured notes 
the remaining million was raised through the issuance of million shares of common stock 
in september  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for up to million in preferred stock and common stock in addition to our prior shelf registration permitting up to million in preferred stock and common stock 
on october   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock including  shares pursuant to the exercise  in part  by the underwriters of their over allotment option at a price per share of to the public  raising approximately million in gross proceeds 
for additional information please reference our form k  dated october  on file with the sec 
after issuance of these shares  we had approximately million in remaining securities available for future issuance under our shelf registration 
in  we utilized cash generated from operations and financing activities in in future periods  management anticipates funding our capital needs through a relatively balanced approach between long term debt and equity 
we did not issue any significant long term debt or common stock in in the first half of cal water anticipates issuing approximately million first mortgage debt guaranteed by the company in a public offering 
cal water s ability to complete the offering is dependent on receiving cpuc approval which it is seeking  and public offering market conditions after it receives the approval 
additional information regarding the bank borrowings and long term debt is presented in notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet transactions we do not utilize off balance sheet financing or utilize special purpose entity arrangements for financing 
we do not have equity ownership through joint ventures or partnership arrangements 

table of contents contractual obligations less than after total year years years years in thousands long term debt interest payments advances for construction office leases system leases water supply contracts total our contractual obligations are summarized in the table above 
for pension and post retirement benefits other than pension obligations see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
long term debt payments include annual sinking fund payments on first mortgage bonds  maturities of long term debt  and annual payments on other long term obligations 
advances for construction represent annual contract refunds to developers for the cost of water systems paid for by the developers 
the contracts are non interest bearing  and refunds are generally on a straight line basis over a year period 
system and office leases include obligations associated with leasing water systems and rents for office space 
cal water has water supply contracts with wholesale suppliers in of its operating districts and for the two leased systems in hawthorne and commerce 
for each contract  the cost of water is established by the wholesale supplier and is generally beyond our control 
the amount paid annually to the wholesale suppliers is charged to purchased water expense on our statement of income 
most contracts do not require minimum annual payments and vary with the volume of water purchased 
we have a contract with the santa clara water district  which contains minimal purchase provisions 
the contract payment varies with the volume of water purchased above the minimal levels 
management plans to continue to purchase and use at least the minimum water requirement under this contract in the future 
total paid under this contract was million in  million in  and million in the water supply contract with stockton east water district sewd requires a fixed  annual payment and does not vary during the year with the quantity of water delivered by the district 
due to the fixed price arrangement  we utilize as much water as possible from sewd in order to minimize the cost of operating company owned wells used to supplement sewd deliveries 
the total paid under the contract was million in  million in  and million in pricing under the contract varies annually 
estimated annual contractual obligations in the above table are based on the same payment level as future cost increases by sewd are expected to be offset by a decline in the allocation of costs to us as more of these costs are expected to be allocated to other sewd customers due to growth within their service areas 
on september   we entered into an agreement with kern county water agency agency to obtain treated water for our operations 
the term of the agreement is to january   or until the agency s bonds are repaid 
the agency s bonds are described below 
under the terms of the agreement  we were obligated to purchase approximately  acre feet of treated water in and an incrementally higher volume of water for each subsequent year until  when we are obligated to purchase  acre feet of treated water per year 
we are obligated to pay a capital facilities charge and a treated water charge  both of which will be expensed as invoiced  regardless of whether we can use the water in our operation  and we are obligated for these charges even if the agency cannot produce an adequate amount to supply the  acre feet in the year 
this agreement supersedes a prior agreement with kern county water agency for the supply of  acre feet of water per year 
total paid  under the prior agreement  was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
three other parties  including the city of bakersfield  are also obligated to purchase a total of  acre feet per year under separate agreements with the agency 
further  the agency has the right to proportionally reduce the water supply provided to all of the participants if it cannot produce adequate supplies 
the participation of all parties in the transaction for expansion of the agency s facilities  including its water purification plant  purchase of the 
table of contents water  and payment of interest and principal on the bonds being issued by the agency to finance the transaction  is required as a condition to the obligation of the agency to proceed with expansion of the agency s facilities 
if any of the other parties does not use its allocation in a given year  that party is still obligated to pay its contracted amount 
the agency has issued bonds to fund the project and will use the payments of the capital facilities charges by us and the other contracted parties to meet the agency s obligations to pay interest and repay principal on the bonds 
if any of the parties were to default on making payments of the capital facilities charge  then the other parties are obligated to pay for the defaulting party s share on a pro rata basis 
if there is a payment default by a party and the remaining parties have to make payments  they are also entitled to a pro rata share of the defaulting party s water allocation 
we expect to use all of its entitled water in our operations every year 
if additional treated water is available  all parties have an option to purchase this additional treated water  subject to the agency s right to allocate the water among the parties 
if we were to pay for and receive additional amounts of water due to a default of another participating party  we believe we could use this additional water in our operations without incurring substantial increases in incremental costs 
the total obligation of all parties  excluding us  is approximately million to the agency 
based on the credit worthiness of the other participants  which are government entities  our management believes it to be highly unlikely that we would be required to assume any other parties obligations under the contract due to their default 
if a party defaults  we would receive entitlement to the additional water for assuming the additional obligation 
once the project is complete  we are obligated to pay a capital facilities charge and a treated water charge that together total million annually  which equates to per acre foot 
annual payments of million for the capital facilities charge began when the agency issued bonds to fund the project 
some of the treated water charge of million began july   when a portion of the planned capacity became available 
once the entire expansion project is completed  the full annual payments will be million which will continue through the term of the agreement 
as treated water is being delivered  we will also be obligated for our portion of the operating costs  that portion is currently estimated to be per acre foot 
the actual amount will vary due to variations from estimates  inflation  and other changes in the cost structure 
our overall estimated cost of per acre foot is less than the estimated cost of procuring untreated water assuming water rights could be obtained and then providing treatment 
capital requirements capital requirements consist primarily of new construction expenditures for expanding and replacing utility plant facilities and the acquisition of water systems 
they also include refunds of advances for construction 
company funded utility plant expenditures were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
a majority of capital expenditures was associated with mains and water treatment equipment 
for  the company is estimating its capital expenditures to be between and million 
we do not expect a decline in annual capital expenditure for the next five years 
other capital expenditures are funded through developer advances and contributions in aid of construction non company funded 
the cash expenditure amounts were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the changes from year to year reflect expansion projects by developers in our service areas 
management expects us to incur non company funded expenditures in these expenditures will be financed by developers through refundable advances for construction and non refundable contributions in aid of construction 
developers are required to deposit the cost of a water construction project with us prior to our commencing construction work  or the developers may construct the facilities themselves and deed the completed facilities to us 
funds are generally received in advance of incurring costs for these projects 
advances are normally refunded over a year period without interest 
future payments for advances received are listed under contractual obligations above 
because non company funded construction activity is solely at the discretion of developers  we 
table of contents cannot predict the level of future activity 
the cash flow impact is expected to be minor due to the structure of the arrangements 
capital structure common stockholders equity was million compared to million at december  and  respectively 
during  we redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of series c preferred stock 
there were no significant additional long term debt borrowings in or total capitalization  including the current portion of long term debt  at december   was million and million at december  the company intends to issue common stock and long term debt to finance our operations 
the capitalization ratios will vary depending upon the method we choose to finance our operations 
at december  capitalization ratios were common equity preferred stock long term debt the return from both regulated and non regulated operations on average common equity was in compared to in acquisitions although there were no significant acquisitions in the periods presented  the following acquisitions were completed in  and in  the company s wholly owned subsidiary hws utility services  llc  acquired contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems in hawaii 
the purchase price of million was paid with the issuance of the company s common stock 
the purchase price is being amortized over the remaining life of the contracts 
on september   after receiving regulatory approval  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  hawaii water service company  inc acquired all the outstanding stock of three related privately held companies waikoloa resort utilities  inc  waikoloa water company  inc  waikoloa sewer company  inc 
on the island of hawaii with water and wastewater operations 
the combined purchase price was million 
assets acquired were million  including cash of million 
liabilities assumed were million net of million which was paid at close of escrow 
goodwill of million was recorded 
the company is in the process of finalizing the valuation of certain intangible assets as well as acquired tax operating loss carryforwards  therefore the purchase price is subject to further refinement upon completion of a valuation study 
on december   after receiving regulatory approval  hawaii water acquired the water and wastewater assets of two other privately held company kukio utility company and wb maninowali for a cash price of million which was the assigned value of the assets 
no liabilities were assumed 
in  after receiving regulatory approval  we acquired for cash a water system with allowed rate base of approximately million 
in addition  in washington we acquired five water systems for million in cash  which was the approximate value of rate base of the systems 
in august  we acquired the assets of independent utility company  for approximately million in cash in exchange for the assets of the system  including three wells and acre feet of water rights 
located miles east of albuquerque  new mexico  we merged the system and its customers into new mexico water service company 
no goodwill was recorded in the transaction 

table of contents real estate program we own real estate 
from time to time  certain parcels are deemed no longer used or useful for water utility operations 
most surplus properties have a low cost basis 
we developed a program to realize the value of certain surplus properties through sale or lease of those properties 
the program will be ongoing for a period of several years 
property sales produced pretax gains of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
as sales are dependent on real estate market conditions  future sales  if any  may or may not be at prior year levels 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not participate in hedge arrangements  such as forward contracts  swap agreements  options  or other contractual agreements to mitigate the impact of market fluctuations on our assets  liabilities  production  or contractual commitments 
we operate only in the united states and  therefore  are not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks 
terrorism risk due to terrorist risks  we have heightened security at our facilities over the past few years and have taken added precautions to protect our employees and the water delivered to customers 
we have complied with epa regulations concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the epa as required 
in addition  communication plans have been developed as a component of our procedures related to this risk 
while we do not make public comments on our security programs  we have been in contact with federal  state  and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve our water delivery systems security 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk  although this risk is lessened because we operate in a regulated industry 
if interest rates were to increase  management believes customer rates would increase accordingly  subject to commission approval in future grc filings 
the majority of our debt is long term at a fixed rate 
interest rate risk does exist on short term borrowings within our credit facilities  as these interest rates are variable 
we also have interest rate risk on new financing  as higher interest cost may occur on new debt if interest rates increase 
stock price risk because we operate primarily in a regulated industry  our stock price volatility risk is somewhat lessened  however  regulated parameters also can be recognized as limitations to operations  earnings  and the ability to respond to certain business condition changes 
an adverse change in the stock price could make issuance of common stock less attractive in the future 
stock market performance risk our stock price could be affected by changes in the general market 
this could impact the costs of obtaining funds through the equity markets 
stock market performance could also impact us through the investments by our defined benefit plan and postretirement medical benefit plan 
we are responsible for funding these plans 
plan investments are made in stock market equities using mutual funds and in corporate bonds 
poor performance of the equity and bond markets could result in increased costs and additional funding requirements due to lower investment returns 
management believes we would be able to recover these higher costs in customer rates 
equity risk we do not have equity investments and  therefore  do not have equity risks
