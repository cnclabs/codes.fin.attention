item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included beginning on page f of this form k 
the discussion in this form k contains both historical information and forward looking statements 
a number of factors affect our operating results and could cause our actual future results to differ materially from any forward looking results discussed below 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as anticipates  appears  believes  continue  could  estimates  expects  feels  goal  hope  intends  may  our future success depends  plans  potential  predicts  projects  reasonably  seek to continue  should  thinks  will or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
actual events or results may differ materially 
in addition  historical information should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  the risks discussed in part i  item a of this form k under the caption risk factors 
these factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance  or achievements 
moreover  we are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this form k to conform these statements to actual results 
these forward looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of overview we develop  market and support innovative broadband access products designed to enable telecom service providers to offer  voice  video and data  or triple play  services over both copper and fiber optic networks 
our broadband loop carrier  or blc  is an integrated hardware and software platform that uses internet protocol  or ip  and ethernet technologies to increase the capabilities of local access networks  enabling our customers to deliver advanced services  including voice over ip  or voip  websurfing and other high speed data communications services  ip based television  or iptv  including high definition television  or hdtv  or in some cases all three of these services  referred to as triple play 
our platform simultaneously supports traditional voice services  enabling our customers to leverage their existing networks and migrate to ip services and networks without disruption 
in addition to providing our customers with increased bandwidth  our products provide incremental value by offering software based features to improve the quality  resiliency and security of triple play services 
our blc products enable all of these services over either traditional twisted pair copper telephone lines or over newer fiber to the premise  or fttp  lines 
we market our products through a combination of direct and indirect channels 
our direct sales efforts are focused on the north american independent operating company  or ioc  segment of the telecom service provider market 
these are companies that never were a part of the original bell system 
we have expanded our sales activities to include the caribbean  latin america  pacific islands and certain other international locations  but sales outside north america continue to represent an insignificant portion of our business 
as of december   we had shipped our blc platform to over telecommunications customers 
from our inception through december   we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million 
we realized income from operations and were profitable on a net income basis during the quarters ended december   december   september   and for the year ended december  previously  we had not been profitable on a quarterly or annual basis  excluding the quarter ended december   in which we realized modest operating income of  we experienced operating and net losses in the first  second and third quarters of fiscal 
table of contents and for fiscal as a whole 
we do not believe that our return to profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal is indicative of future quarterly performance  and we expect to continue to experience delays or cancellations of customer orders in in the second  third and fourth quarters of  we experienced a softening in our business as we experienced declining customer orders 
we believe this softening was attributable in part to delays associated with our customers evaluations of strategic investment decisions concerning their movement from copper wire to fiber  in part to a shift in our customer base toward longer term loan projects funded by the us department of agriculture s rural utilities service  or rus program  and in part to general macro economic conditions which continued to deteriorate throughout we cannot predict the timing or amount of orders and we expect to continue to experience some delays or cancellations of customer orders in in the light of macroeconomic conditions  we have limited visibility into customer purchasing patterns and believe that our revenues and operating results will depend substantially on trends in capital equipment spending by iocs 
currently  we expect capital equipment budgets to be reduced in but believe that the overall negative budget trend could be offset  in part  by government broadband spending initiatives 
in october we restated our previously released consolidated financial statements for the following fiscal periods i the fiscal years ended december  and december   ii each of the interim quarterly periods in the fiscal years ended december  and december   and iii each of the interim quarterly periods ended march  june  and september  prior to january   when we adopted a calendar year end for fiscal reporting purposes  we prepared our consolidated financial statements with the end of each quarter falling on the last sunday of each calendar quarter 
as a result  our accounting quarters did not necessarily coincide with the last day of the calendar month 
effective january   we adopted a calendar fiscal year end 
the quarter end dates for fiscal were march  june  september  and december critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  litigation  accounts receivable reserves  sales returns reserves  warranty reserve and valuation of deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales revenue when persuasive evidence of sales arrangements exist  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we allow credit for products returned within our policy terms 

table of contents in addition to the aforementioned general policy  we enter into transactions that represent multiple element arrangements  which may include training and post sales technical support and maintenance to our customers as needed to assist them in installation or use of our products  and make provisions for these costs in the periods of sale 
multiple element arrangements are assessed to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
a multiple element arrangement is separated into more than one unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if these criteria are not met  then sales are deferred until such criteria are met or until the period s over which the last undelivered element is delivered 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative fair value 
in certain circumstances  we enter into arrangements with customers who receive financing support in the form of long term low interest rate loans from the united states department of agriculture s rural utilities service  or rus 
the terms of the rus contracts provide that in certain instances transfer of title of our products does not occur until customer acceptance 
we do not recognize revenue until final payment has been received  provided the remaining revenue recognition criteria are met 
in we revised the policy to classify to deferred revenue  amounts associated with these rus contracts which were previously offset against accounts receivable 
to conform the prior year presentation we have reclassified million  which was offset against accounts receivable  to deferred revenue as of december  in certain circumstances  we enter into transactions with value added resellers where the resellers may not have the ability to pay us for these sales independent of payment to them by the end user 
in these cases  we do not recognize revenue until payment has been received  provided the remaining revenue recognition criteria are met 
we further warrant our products for periods up to five years and record an estimated warranty accrual when shipment occurs 
valuation of inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of acquisition cost or market value  with cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand and market conditions and compare them with current inventory levels 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax asset to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
for  and our net deferred tax assets have been offset with a full valuation allowance 

table of contents loss contingencies we evaluate our estimated potential financial exposure for loss contingencies  particularly the pending litigation matters discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  we accrue an estimated loss related to a contingency if a it is probable that a liability had been incurred and future events will occur confirming the fact of the loss at the date of the consolidated financial statements and b the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  we accrue the minimum amount in the range 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimated potential liability could materially impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we have not recorded an accrual for an estimated loss for the ipo allocation case because we believe the anticipated settlement amounts are covered by our insurance policies 
product warranties we provide a standard warranty with the sale of our products for up to five years from the date of shipment 
the estimated cost of providing the product warranty is recorded at the time of shipment 
we maintain product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers 
we quantify and record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual history  projected return and failure rates and current repair costs 
our estimates are based on the actual number of products returned for repairs  an estimate of products that may be returned for warranty repair and estimated costs of repair depending on the type of service required 
these estimates require us to examine past warranty issues and consider their continuing impact in the future 
our accrual is based on consideration of all these factors which are known as of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
to the extent that actual warranty repairs are higher than our estimates  our costs will increase 
the costs for warranty returns totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
stock based compensation effective beginning the first fiscal quarter of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation costs for all awards granted after the date of adoption and the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding at the date of adoption are measured at estimated fair value and included in cost of sales and operating expenses over the vesting period during which an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
prior period amounts presented herein have not been restated to reflect the adoption of sfas no 
r 
upon adoption of sfas r  we selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the use of the black scholes model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility  forfeitures  and expected dividends 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we do not anticipate declaring dividends in the foreseeable future 
expected volatility is based on the annualized weekly historical volatility of our stock price and we believe it is indicative of future volatility 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise and post vesting cancellation patterns with consideration to our industry peers of similar size with similar option vesting periods 
our analysis of stock price volatility and option lives involves management s best estimates at the time of determination 
sfas r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only 
table of contents the portion of options or stock units that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply an estimated forfeiture rate that is derived from historical employee termination behavior 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for the fair value of restricted stock  including restricted stock units 
fair value is determined by using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date 
the fair value of these awards is recognized to expense over the requisite service period of the awards 
during and  stock based compensation expense associated with restricted stock totaled  and  respectively 
restatement of consolidated financial statements on october   we announced that the audit committee of our board of directors had completed its previously announced internal review of our revenue recognition practices 
as a result of the review  we determined that our previously filed consolidated financial statements for the following periods required restatement i our fiscal years ended december  and december   ii each of the interim quarterly periods in our fiscal years ended december  and december   and iii each of the interim quarterly periods ended march  june  and september  the adjustments resulting from the restatement related solely to revenue recognition matters 
the restatement adjustments did not affect our reported cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances as of the end of any fiscal period 
specifically  we determined that a restatement was required because we incorrectly accounted for the following categories of transactions i transactions involving commitments to certain customers in connection with sales for features or deliverables that were not available at the time revenue was originally recognized  including commitments to prospectively provide free product  software  training  and installation services  for which we prematurely recognized approximately million in revenue from fiscal to fiscal  ii sales to value added resellers where the resellers did not have the ability to pay us for these sales independent of payment to them by the end user  for which we prematurely recognized approximately million in revenue from fiscal to fiscal  and iii for certain quarters ending on weekends  transactions involving our use of a shipping vendor who picked up product for subsequent delivery to another shipping company where the terms and conditions of the shipments did not appropriately transfer title or risk of loss at the time of shipment  for which we prematurely recognized approximately million in revenue from fiscal to fiscal in addition  we prematurely recognized approximately million of revenue from fiscal through fiscal relating principally to errors in accounting for software and software maintenance  customer credits  and undelivered free product 
in determining that a restatement was required  we accounted for hardware sales and related cost of sales in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  or sab we accounted for software sales in accordance with aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  or sop we accounted for sales with multiple deliverables in accordance with emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf 
table of contents results of operations fiscal years ended december   december  and december  revenue in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended december  december  december  revenue our revenue is principally comprised of our blc series system product line  cabinets and related accessories 
revenue increased by million or to million in as compared to revenue of million in the increase in our revenue was due to higher sales of copper product as well as revenue from newly released gpon products in mid we believe our revenues in the second half of were also adversely affected by our then pending audit committee investigation and financial restatement 
in the fourth quarter of  we experienced an improvement in revenues increasing significantly from the third quarter but do not believe that these results were indicative of future near term quarterly performance 
although  we benefited from strong seasonal spending from our customer base and new customers in the fourth quarter of  we also experienced a softening in new order activity in late we expect that current macroeconomic conditions will likely have an adverse impact on our business in  in particular as carriers evaluate capital spending budgets in a difficult economic environment and in light of the industry transition from copper wire to fiber 
we believe iocs will carefully evaluate spending decisions in although government broadband funding initiatives could have a favorable and offsetting impact on capital spending trends among telecommunications carriers 
revenue increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase in sales in over was mainly due to continued expansion of our customer base  repeat orders from existing customers and increased sales of new and existing blc products  related accessories and cabinets 
in  these factors were partially offset by a softening in our business in the second and third quarters of that we believe was attributable to adverse trends affecting our target customer markets  delays associated with our customers evaluations of strategic investment decisions concerning their movement from copper wire to fiber and uncertainty concerning our delayed financial reporting 
cost of revenue and gross margin in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended december  december  december  cost of revenue gross margin gross margin percentage cost of revenue includes the cost of products shipped for which sales were recognized  warranty costs  costs of any manufacturing yield problems  field replacements  rework costs  manufacturing overhead  provisions for obsolete inventory and the cost of post sale support 
cost of revenue increased by million or to million in as compared to million in this increase in cost of revenue in was attributable primarily to increased sales of our products and an inventory provision for certain product components 
our gross margin in was at as compared to in the increase was attributable to lower product and warranty costs 

table of contents cost of revenue increased by million  or  to million in compared to million this increase in cost of revenue in was primarily due to an increase in revenues 
we expect that our gross margin will vary from quarter to quarter due in part to variations in product mix 
for example  our gross margin percentages were   and in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal is primarily attributable to an inventory provision recorded for last time buys for specific components for risk management purposes 
to the extent that we introduce new products into the market  we anticipate our gross margin will fluctuate primarily as a function of our product mix 
research and product development expense in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended december  december  december  research and product development research and product development as a percentage of revenue research and product development consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  prototype component and assembly costs  third party design services and consulting costs  and other costs related to design  development  and testing of our products 
research and product development costs are expensed as incurred  except for capital expenditures  which are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  generally two to five years 
research and product development expenses increased by million or to million in as compared to million in the increase in research and product development expenses was attributable to increased personnel and related costs  certain costs related to terawave communications  inc asset purchase and expenses associated with the development of our gpon equipment we currently expect research and product development expenses to continue to increase in future periods as we continue to make investments in our products and technologies 
research and product development expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in research and product development increased primarily as a result of the expense of increased personnel related costs  stock based compensation charges  and third party design costs also contributed to the increase in our research and product development costs in sales and marketing expenses in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended december  december  december  sales and marketing sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  sales commissions  and other personnel related costs  development and distribution of promotional materials  and other costs related to generating sales and conducting corporate marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million or to million in as compared to million in this increase was 
table of contents primarily due to increased headcount  commissions and marketing events 
we expect sales and marketing costs to continue to increase in as we continue to make expenditures aimed at increasing sales and market penetration in our target markets as well as in adjacent and international markets 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in sales and marketing increased primarily due to increased headcount  increased commission and other sales and promotional costs incurred in an effort to increase sales and market penetration 
general and administrative expenses in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended december  december  december  general and administrative general and administrative as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs for executive  finance  human resources  and administrative personnel 
additionally  general and administrative include professional fees  liability insurance and other general corporate costs such as rent  legal  utilities and accounting expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower legal and accounting fees related to the audit committee review 
we expect our general and administrative expenses in to remain relatively consistent with general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to million of professional fees and expenses related to the audit committee review 
we also incurred additional general and administrative costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance  the terawave communications  inc asset purchase  additional headcount and stock based compensation expense 
purchase of in process research and development in thousands  except percentages in and  we did not incur charges for in process research and development

r will continue to have a material effect on our consolidated statement of operations 
stock based compensation expenses increased by approximately million or to million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this net increase is attributable to the grants of additional options and awards offset by an increase in the forfeiture rate used in our stock based compensation expense calculations 
stock based compensation expenses increased by approximately million or to million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this net increase is primarily attributable to a change in the forfeiture rate used in our stock based compensation expense calculations and grants of additional options

interest income expense  net in thousands fiscal year ended december  december  december  interest income interest expense total interest income expense  net interest income  net decreased by from to this decrease in interest income was principally attributable to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates 
interest income increased from to this increase in interest income was principally attributable to higher average cash balances in from our november public offering 
these funds were invested primarily in money market funds 
interest expense decreased from to due to the repayment of our outstanding debt in early provision for income taxes in thousands fiscal year ended december  december  december  provision for income taxes for income tax purposes  we consider our projected annual income and the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards among other factors 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded income tax expense of   and  respectively  for federal and state income taxes 
the increase in the income tax expense is primarily attributable to an increase in taxable income due to the impact of unfavorable timing differences for tax purposes as well as the suspension of our ability to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards in the state of california in 
table of contents net operating loss carry forwards as of december   the we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million to offset federal and state future taxable income  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire beginning in and  respectively 
in addition  we have federal research tax credits of million which may be carried forward to and state research tax credits of million which may be carried forward indefinitely 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the case of an ownership change of a corporation 
any ownership changes  as defined  may restrict utilization of the carryforwards 
beneficial conversion feature in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended december  december  december  beneficial conversion feature in and we did not incur any charges related to the beneficial conversion feature 
in  we recorded beneficial conversion feature charges to net loss attributable to common stockholders of million related to the issuance of our series a preferred stock in february liquidity and capital resources our future capital requirements depend on many factors  some of which are outside of our control 
we expect our cash used in operations to decrease in at a lesser rate as compared to in part due to cost control initiatives implemented in we believe that existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for the next twelve months 
however  these cash flow and operating results expectations are subject to numerous assumptions  many of which may not actually occur 
if some or all of such assumptions do not occur  our results may be substantially lower or different than expected  and our cash resources could be reduced faster than currently anticipated 
such assumptions include  without limitation  assumptions that new product introductions will occur on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance  that customer testing and service provider deployments occur as anticipated  that our customer base will continue to grow  that we do not experience an adverse result in existing litigation or new legal proceedings  and that our industry s competitive landscape will not change adversely 
for more information about the risks relating to our business  please read carefully the section of this report entitled risk factors 
a material portion of our cash balances are restricted to secure performance bonds we are required to post in connection with customer purchases under the rural utility loan program of the department of agriculture 
restricted cash totaled approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we expect to devote capital resources to continue our research and development efforts  to support our sales and marketing  and to fund general corporate activities 
we may also consider making strategic investments in complementary products or technologies  which could require further cash expenditures 
comparison and as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  restricted cash of million  stockholders equity of million  and working capital of million  compared with cash and cash equivalents of million  restricted cash of million  stockholders equity of 
table of contents million  and working capital of million as of december  the reduction in our cash and cash equivalents from december  to december  was primarily related to our net loss from operations for  including leasehold improvements  equipment purchases and purchases of performance bonds

in october we purchased certain assets of terawave communications  inc for million in cash and million in assumed liabilities  the objective of which was to acquire terawave s gigabit passive optical networking technology 
also contributing to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was the increase from million to million in restricted cash related to the purchases of performance bonds which we were required to post in connection with our rus contracts

although we believe these funds will be sufficient to maintain and expand our operations in accordance with our business strategy  we may need additional funds in the future 
if we are unable to raise additional financing when and if needed  we may be required to reduce certain discretionary spending  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
we lease our facilities and certain assets under non cancelable operating leases expiring through  excluding various renewal options 
the following table summarizes our minimum purchase commitment to our contract manufacturers and our minimum commitments under non cancelable operating leases as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations purchase commitments operating leases licensing agreements capital leases under the terms of our agreement with our contract manufacturer  we issue purchase orders for the production of our products

the agreement includes certain lead time and cancellation provisions 
future amounts payable to the contract manufacturer will vary based on the level of purchase requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements  other than the operating leases and certain purchase commitments described above 

table of contents indemnification obligations we enter into indemnification provisions under our agreements with other companies in our ordinary course of business  typically with our contractors  customers  channel partners  landlords and our agreements with investors 
under these provisions  we generally indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of our activities or  in some cases  as a result of the indemnified party s activities under the agreement 
these indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is generally unlimited 
as of december   we had not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnifications agreements and we have no material liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  and other matters from time to time  we are subject to threats of litigation or actual litigation in the ordinary course of business  some of which may be material 
we believe that  except as described above  there are no currently pending matters that  if determined adversely to us  would have a material effect on our business or that would not be covered by our existing liability insurance maintained by us

in may  the fasb issued fsp no 
fin definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 
 fsp fin amends fin to provide guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax provision is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 
the term effectively settled replaces the term ultimately settled when used to describe recognition  and the terms settlement or settled replace the terms ultimate settlement or 
table of contents ultimately settled when used to describe measurement of a tax position under fin fsp fin clarifies that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished 
for tax positions considered effectively settled  an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit  even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statue of limitations remains open
