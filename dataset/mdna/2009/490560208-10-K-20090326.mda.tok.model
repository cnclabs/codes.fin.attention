risk factors risk factors related to the company the company s business success is wholly dependent on the success of kent international and kent educational 
kent s business is comprised entirely of the management of kent international and kent educational 
accordingly  any risks affecting those companies constitute risks to kent at the same time 
risk factors related to kent international for a discussion of kent international s risk factors  please refer to kent international s annual report for the year ended december  filed on form k under sec file no 
all of the risk factors set forth under item a of that report are incorporated herein by reference 
risk factors related to kent educational the academy is currently reviewing its strategic options 
the academy s sole full time executive officer resigned on december  this individual was primarily responsible for business development and coordinating services 
as a result  the academy is currently reviewing its strategic options including hiring a replacement for the executive officer  partnering with a competitor  continuing to provide services to existing clients through an outsourcing platform  or discontinuation of services 
the educational services sector in new jersey is highly competitive 
the academy operates in a highly fragmented market with numerous small service providers and no dominant competition 
there can be no assurance that the academy will maintain or improve its competitive position or that no single competitor or group of competitors will dominate the market in the future 
the resources allocated for educational purposes are unforeseeable 
the allocation of resources for educational purposes is currently under great scrutiny in new jersey 
funding for public schools in new jersey comes from either state aid or local property taxes 
although property taxes have increased rapidly in new jersey over the last eight years  this has not resulted in additional educational expenditures  because the state of new jersey has at the same time reduced its aid allocated to public schools 
it is impossible to foresee the future developments of property taxes and educational state aids 
as public schools in new jersey are currently our primary customer  our revenue growth is restricted by any limitation on these resources
