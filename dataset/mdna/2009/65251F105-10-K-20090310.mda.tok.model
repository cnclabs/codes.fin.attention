item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
important factors that may cause actual results and circumstances to differ materially from those described in such statements is contained below and in item a 
risk factors of this report 
overview we are a commercial finance company that provides customized debt financing solutions to middle market businesses and commercial real estate borrowers 
we principally focus on the direct origination of loans that meet our risk and return parameters 
our direct origination efforts target private equity sponsors  corporate executives  regional banks  real estate investors and a variety of other financial intermediaries to source transaction opportunities 
direct origination provides direct access to customers management  enhances due diligence  and allows significant input into customers capital structure and direct negotiation of transaction pricing and terms 
we operate as a single segment and derive revenues from two specialized lending groups middle market corporate  which originates  structures and underwrites senior debt and  to a lesser extent  second lien  mezzanine and subordinated debt  and equity and equity linked products for companies with annual ebitda typically between million and million  and commercial real estate  which originates  structures and underwrites first mortgage debt and  to a lesser extent  subordinated debt  primarily to finance acquisitions of real estate properties typically valued between million and million 
subsequent to december   we discontinued the origination of structured products and continue to manage the remaining portfolio within our middle market corporate lending group 
as of december   this portfolio had an outstanding balance of million 
market conditions the economy deteriorated dramatically during as the united states entered a recession 
higher unemployment  a decline in housing prices  an increase in default rates across a wide range of asset classes and an overall decrease in lending continue to strain the economy 
the financial services industry changed significantly through bankruptcies  consolidations  mergers  conservatorships and substantial government aid  legislation and regulation 
the effect of the economic downturn has led to a lack of confidence and severe dislocation in the capital and credit markets 
bank loan markets and securitization markets  specifically collateralized debt obligation markets  continue to experience significant volatility with continued selling pressure by certain types of investors  many of which are leveraged 
we expect to continue to experience difficulty in securing term debt financing for our loan portfolio 
we anticipate that available debt financing generally will be at higher costs and lower advance rates than the financing that was available earlier in our history 
given current market conditions  we believe that it is unlikely that we would be able to complete a traditional term debt securitization 
amendments and renewals of our existing credit facilities obtained in have been more expensive and provide lower advance rates than similar transactions completed in prior periods 
while we expect to be negatively impacted by the trend toward higher cost of borrowing and lower leverage  we believe that we will also benefit from these market conditions by re pricing our existing loans when possible  and originating new loans when possible at significantly higher yields and in many cases on more favorable terms 
the sharp decline in the economy continues to contribute to a decline in overall credit quality 
we are closely monitoring the credit quality of our loans 
we expect loan delinquencies  non accruals  and charge offs to increase as the economy continues to weaken 

table of contents as a result of the current market and funding conditions  opportunities in the commercial real estate market have slowed 
moreover  refinancing current loans will be difficult 
we did not originate any new commercial real estate loans during the last three quarters of recent developments bank related on january   we entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement to acquire southern commerce bank 
subject to us obtaining required regulatory approvals and the fulfillment of customary closing conditions  we anticipate the acquisition will close during the second quarter of on january   we applied to the federal reserve for approval to become a bank holding company and to acquire southern commerce bank 
the acquisition of southern commerce bank and the transition to a bank holding company is part of our strategy to diversify our funding sources and expand the products and services we are able to offer our customers 
we believe that this strategy will allow us to reduce the risks in our current funding model  resulting in a decreased dependence on short term credit facilities provided by banks and the issuance of securitized term debt in the capital markets as our primary sources of capital 
liquidity on january  we entered into an amendment to the million term debt facility with deutsche bank ag  new york branch deutsche which reduced the commitment amount under the term debt facility to million and will gradually reduce our advance rate from an effective rate of approximately as of january  to no more than pursuant to the terms of the amendment 
on december   we entered into an amendment to the million credit facility with wachovia capital markets  llc wachovia which reduced the commitment amount under the credit facility to million  reduced the advance borrowing base from an effective rate of to  and increased the concentration limits of assets in the buildings and real estate moody s industry classification group to of the outstanding credit facility amount for periods prior to and including april  an increase of and to of the outstanding credit facility amount for periods after april  on november   we entered into a definitive agreement with citicorp north america  inc citicorp which replaced our existing million credit facility with citigroup global markets realty corp 
with a new million credit facility

during  we made minor modifications to our general reserve analysis to simplify and more closely align it with our internal credit ratings  which incorporate our ratings migration and loan default experience 
delinquent loan rate delinquent loan rate  which is total delinquent loans that are days or more past due  divided by outstanding gross loans  was as of december  consisting of two of our non accrual loans 
we did not have any delinquent loans as of december  given prevailing economic and market conditions  we expect the delinquency loan rate to increase as the economy continues to weaken 
non accrual loan rate non accrual loan rate is defined as total balances outstanding of loans in non accrual status divided by our loans held for investment 
loans are put on non accrual status if they are days or more past due or if management believes that there is reasonable doubt as to collectibility in the normal course of business 
the 
table of contents non accrual loan rate was as of december  and as of december  as of december  and the aggregate outstanding value of non accrual loans was million and million  respectively 
given prevailing economic and market conditions  we expect the non accrual rate to increase as the economy continues to weaken 
net charge off rate net charge off rate as a percentage of loan portfolio is defined as annualized charge offs net of recoveries divided by our loans held for investment 
a charge off occurs when management believes that all or part of the principal of a particular loan is no longer recoverable and will not be repaid 
for the year ended december   the net charge off rate was and for the year ended december   it was 
we did not charge off any loans during we expect the net charge off rate to increase if the economy continues to weaken

interest income decreased million  to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets to from primarily driven by a decrease in three month libor  partially offset by growth in average interest earning assets of million 
average three month libor decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our cost of borrowings  partially offset by an increase in average borrowings of million from december  to fund growth in interest earning assets 
the decrease in our cost of borrowings  to from  was primarily attributable to a decrease in three month libor  negotiated lower borrowing spreads on our credit facilities and increased use of lower cost term debt securitizations

table of contents new loan originations and re pricings and a decrease in our average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the decrease in yield and cost is primarily due to a decrease in three month libor 
the net interest spread  the difference between gross yield on our interest earning assets and the total cost of our interest bearing liabilities  increased to from as the decline in three month libor had a greater impact on the cost of interest bearing liabilities which re price more frequently than our interest earning assets

operating expenses decreased million  to million for from million for employee compensation and benefits decreased million primarily due to a decrease in the non cash compensation charge related to restricted stock grants made since our inception  including equity awards made in connection with the initial public offering  partially offset by severance costs of million during during  we reduced the number of employees to reflect our anticipated decline in loan origination volumes 
general and administrative expenses increased million and occupancy and equipment expenses increased million 
income taxes

our effective tax rate for reflects the impact of timing differences related to the recognition of losses on the residual interest in securitization  the impact of nondeductible compensation expenses incurred in connection with our initial public offering and the impact of a related discrete tax item 
our effective tax benefit rate for includes two significant items  approximately million relating to the impact of nondeductible compensation expense incurred in connection with our initial public offering and million resulting from the non recognition of certain state tax benefits primarily resulting from the phase out of our structured products group  including losses incurred on securities sold in our second quarter off balance sheet transaction 
as of december  and we had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 

table of contents in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at december  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
comparison of the years ended december  and interest income 
interest income increased million  to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to growth in average interest earning assets of billion  partially offset by a decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets to from primarily driven by a decrease in spreads on new volume and to a lesser extent prepayments of higher yielding loans and a change in the mix of interest earning assets 
the increase in average interest earning assets was primarily driven by the growth in loans of million from december  interest expense 
interest expense increased million  to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of million to fund growth in interest earning assets  partially offset by a decrease in our cost of borrowings

any change in the fair value of the residual interest is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations

as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 

table of contents financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash flow from operations  credit facilities  term debt securitizations and proceeds from equity and debt offerings 
we believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our operations  projected lending activities and other short term liquidity needs 
we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital based on various factors  including if our loan portfolio grows faster than anticipated  the value of non accrual loans increases faster than expected  we are unable to fund certain loans with credit facilities or term debt securitizations  or if our cash flow from operations is lower than expected 
our future liquidity needs will be determined primarily based on the credit performance of our loan portfolio 
to fund our loan portfolio and continuing operations  we anticipate that we will need to incur additional indebtedness  enter into additional term debt securitizations or raise equity capital 
we may not be able to raise such debt or equity capital on acceptable terms or at all 
the incurrence of additional debt will increase our leverage and interest expense  and the issuance of any debt or equity securities may be dilutive for existing shareholders 
the planned acquisition of southern commerce bank will require cash payments to the seller in the amount of the purchase price and an additional investment consistent to meet regulatory capital requirements 
we believe our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to provide the required capital 
we estimate the purchase price of southern commerce bank will be between million and million subject to certain conditions 
we anticipate that the proposed acquisition of southern commerce bank will improve our access to liquidity and provide a stable source of funding through the bank s retail deposit franchise 
with this new source of liquidity we believe that we will be able to reduce our reliance on warehouse credit facilities provided by other banks  which are currently our primary source of capital 
we have proposed in our regulatory applications made in connection with the proposed acquisition of southern commerce bank to complete a one time balance sheet restructuring  which would recapitalize the bank in connection with a transfer of up to million of existing loan commitments from newstar 
the recapitalization would redeploy capital to southern commerce bank that is currently invested in our warehouse credit facilities supporting those loans that we propose to transfer 
we continue to experience higher costs of borrowing and pressure to reduce leverage 
given current market conditions  we believe that completing a traditional term debt securitization is unlikely 
moreover credit facility renewals and amendments to existing credit facilities in have been more expensive and provide lower advance rates than similar transactions we completed in prior periods 
reduction in advance rates under our warehouse credit facilities in resulted in the use of cash to repay advances 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents 
cash received from our november private placement represented a large portion of our cash balance at december  we invest a portion of cash on hand in short term liquid investments 
from time to time  we may use a portion of our non restricted cash to pay down our credit facilities 
restricted cash separately  we had million and million of restricted cash as of december  and december   respectively 
the restricted cash represents the balance of the principal and interest collections accounts and pre funding amounts in our credit facilities  our term debt securitizations and customer holdbacks and escrows 
the use of the principal collection accounts cash is limited to funding the growth of our loan portfolio within the facilities or paying down related credit facilities or term debt securitizations 
the interest collection account cash is limited to the payment of interest  servicing fees and other expenses of our credit facilities and term debt securitizations and  if either a ratings downgrade or failure to receive ratings confirmation occurs on the rated notes in a term debt securitization at the end of the funding period or if coverage ratios are not met  paying down principal with respect thereto 
cash to fund the growth of our loan portfolio and to pay interest on our term debt securitizations represented a large portion of our restricted cash balance at december  
table of contents asset quality and allowance for loan losses if a loan is days or more past due  or if management believes that there is reasonable doubt as to collectibility in the normal course of business  it is our policy to place the loan on non accrual status 
when a loan is on non accrual status  accrued interest previously recognized as interest income subsequent to the last cash receipt in the current year will be reversed  and the recognition of interest income on that loan will stop until factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist and the loan has been brought current 
we may make exceptions to this policy if the loan is well secured and is in the process of collection 
as of december   we had impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million 
six of the impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million have been restructured and classified as troubled debt restructurings as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings 
six of the impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million were on non accrual status 
two of the impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million were greater than days past due and classified as delinquent 
during  we recorded million of specific provisions for impaired loans 
as our loan portfolio continues to season  we expect to experience additional delinquencies  losses  specific reserves  troubled debt restructurings and charge offs as part of our normal course of business 
moreover  the weakening economy has led to a decline in overall credit quality across the market 
we are closely monitoring the credit quality of our loans 
we expect loan delinquencies  non accruals and charge offs to increase if the economy continues to weaken 
despite our limited historical loss experience  we have provided an allowance for loan losses to provide for losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
our allowance for loan losses as of december  and december  was million and million  or and of loans  gross  respectively 
as of december   we also had a million allowance for unfunded commitments  resulting in an allowance for credit losses of of outstanding loans 
activity in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december   and was as follows year ended december  in thousands balance as of beginning of period provision for loan losses specific provision for loan losses net charge offs balance as of end of period allowance for losses on unfunded loan commitments allowance for credit losses as of december   we had one million asset which was other real estate owned as a result of a foreclosure on an impaired loan 
during  we recorded a million specific provision related to this loan 
the outstanding loan balance has been reclassified from loans  net to other assets on our balance sheet 

table of contents borrowings and liquidity as of december  and  we had outstanding borrowings totaling billion and billion  respectively 
borrowings under our various credit facilities  term debt securitizations and repurchase obligations have supported our loan growth 
as of december   our funding sources  maximum debt amounts  amounts outstanding and unused debt capacity  subject to certain covenants and conditions  are summarized below funding source maximum debt amount amounts outstanding unused debt capacity maturity in thousands credit facilities term debt total maturities for term debt are based on contractual maturity dates 
actual maturities may occur earlier 
we must comply with various covenants  the breach of which could result in a termination event  and at december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
these covenants vary depending on the type of facility and are customary for facilities of this type 
these covenants include  but are not limited to  failure to service debt obligations  failure to meet liquidity covenants and tangible net worth covenants  and failure to remain within prescribed facility portfolio delinquency and charge off levels 
repurchase agreements in the past  we entered into sales of securities under agreements to repurchase with customers and brokers 
these agreements were treated as collateralized financings  and the obligations to repurchase securities sold were reflected as a liability in our balance sheet 
the securities underlying the agreements remain under our control 
at december   we had repurchase agreements outstanding with a total carrying value of million 
at december   the maturities of these agreements ranged from one to three months with a weighted average interest rate of 
debt securities with a market value of million were pledged as collateral for the securities sold under agreements to repurchase at december  we no longer utilize repurchase agreements as a source of liquidity

the sublease commenced may  and terminates february  
table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities we maintain an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
our operations are subject to risks resulting from interest rate fluctuations on our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities 
we seek to provide maximum levels of net interest income  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk 
as such  we enter into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating rate funding agreement liabilities that are matched with fixed rate securities 
under the interest rate swap contracts  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount 
we record the exchanged amount in net interest income in our statements of operations 
under the interest rate cap contracts  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between a specified fixed interest the cap and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount  but only if the floating interest rate exceeds the cap rate 
the interest rate caps currently are not matched to specific assets or liabilities and do not qualify for hedge accounting 
we also offer a fixed rate loan program to certain of our customers which utilizes derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and interest rate collars 
we provide floating interest rate debt to our customers  and to reduce default risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  we enter into interest rate swap  cap and collar contracts with these customers 
subsequently  we may enter into similar offsetting contracts with third parties  or customer derivatives 
these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and are recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 
gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges  including any cash payments made or received  are reported as gain loss on derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations 
during  we entered into interest rate swap agreements which were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges of the risk of changes in our interest payments on libor indexed debt 
the interest rate swap agreements have a combined notional value of million as of december  and have scheduled maturities ranging from april  through october  during  we recorded hedge ineffectiveness of approximately  which is included in gain loss on derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our borrowers 
these financial instruments include unfunded commitments  standby letters of credit and interest rate mitigation products 
the instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet 
the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
unfunded commitments are agreements to lend to a borrower  provided that all conditions have been met 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
because certain commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each borrower s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral required is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower  the borrower s compliance with financial covenants and management s discretion  among other evaluations 
at december   we had million of unfunded commitments 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance by a borrower to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending credit to our borrowers 
at december  we had million of standby letters of credit 
interest rate risk mitigation products are offered to enable customers to meet their financing and risk management objectives 
derivative financial instruments consist predominantly of interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and floors 
the interest rate risks to the company of these customer derivatives is mitigated by entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with other counterparties 
at december   the notional value of the interest rate mitigation products was million 
on june   we completed the sale of securities and loans totaling million  including million of rmbs holdings to a non recourse  off balance sheet financing vehicle and recognized a million loss on the sale 
we retained a residual interest in the assets sold  which had a fair value of at december  our valuation of the residual involves two basic assumptions i a forecast of cash flows from the underlying collateral  and ii a discount rate applied to those cash flows 
this rate was established by modeling the pool to create cdo tranches of aaa through bbb  which reflected a mix of debt in place against those assets and reflected an estimated market rate at that time 
the loss for was driven by further deterioration in the performance of the underlying rmbs collateral assets impacting the anticipated cash flows 
the change in the fair value of the residual interest is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
critical accounting policies accounting policies involving significant estimates and assumptions by management  which have  or could have  a material impact on our financial statements  are considered critical accounting policies 
the following are our critical accounting policies fair value on january   the company adopted sfas which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell the financial asset or paid to transfer the financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 

table of contents the company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures 
sfas differentiates between those assets and liabilities required to be carried at fair value at every reporting period recurring and those assets and liabilities that are only required to be adjusted to fair value under certain circumstances nonrecurring 
cash and cash equivalents  investments in debt securities  available for sale  residual interest in securitization and derivatives are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  the company may be required to record at fair value other financial assets on a nonrecurring basis  such as loans held for sale and loans held for investment 
these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of the lower of cost or market accounting or write downs of individual assets 
further  the notes to the consolidated financial statements include information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities and the valuation methodologies used 
sfas establishes a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 
the classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market derived or market based information obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect management s estimates about market data 
level valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 
level instruments include securities traded on active exchange markets  such as the new york stock exchange  as well as us treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over the counter markets 
level valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market 
level instruments include securities traded in less active dealer or broker markets 
level valuation is generated from model based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
valuation techniques include use of option pricing models  discounted cash flow models and similar techniques 
for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value  it is the company s policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements  in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in sfas when available  the company utilizes quoted market prices to measure fair value 
if market prices are not available  fair value measurement is based upon models that use primarily market based or independently sourced market parameters  including interest rate yield curves  prepayment speeds  option volatilities and other assumptions 
however  in certain cases  when market observable inputs for model based valuation techniques may not be readily available  the company is required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument 
the models used by the company to determine fair value adjustments are periodically evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters 
for financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters  there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value 
when observable market prices and parameters are not fully available  management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
in addition  changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data 
for example  reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable 
therefore  when market data is not available  the company would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement 

table of contents as of december   of total assets and of the assets we measured at fair value used significant unobservable inputs level assets 
during we recognized losses of million in earnings and a loss of million in other comprehensive income related to changes in fair value of these level assets 
the table below sets forth information regarding our level assets as of december  description fair value at december  in thousands commercial loans held for sale senior secured cash flow residual interest in securitization investments in debt securities  available for sale securities backed by residential real estate mortgages  commercial real estate mortgages and other assets securities backed by licenses and easements warrants and equity linked products total level assets at fair value revenue recognition interest income is recorded on the accrual basis in accordance with the terms of the respective loan and debt product 
the accrual of interest on loans and other debt products is discontinued when principal or interest payments are past due by days or more or when  in the opinion of management  there is a reasonable doubt as to the collectibility in the normal course of business 
if loans are placed on non accrual status  all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income 
interest income on non accrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the principal balance is deemed collectible 
nonrefundable fees and related direct costs associated with the origination or purchase of loans and other debt products are deferred and netted against balances outstanding 
the net deferred fees or costs are recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the contractual life of the loans using a method which approximates the effective interest method 
in connection with the prepayment of a loan or other debt product  a partial amount of the remaining unamortized net deferred fees  costs  premiums or discounts are accelerated and recognized as interest income 
the amortization of fees is discontinued on non accrual loans 
depending on the terms of a loan or other debt product  we may charge a prepayment fee and recognize it in the period of the prepayment 
we accrete any discount and amortize any premium from purchased debt products into interest income as a yield adjustment over the contractual life 
syndication  arrangement and structuring fees are recognized in the period the service is completed as a component of non interest income 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is based on a loan by loan build up of inherent losses on loans  gross 
we also maintain an allowance for losses on unfunded loan commitments  namely loan commitments and letters of credit that are reported in other liabilities on the balance sheet 
the methodology for determining the allowance for losses on unfunded loan commitments is consistent with the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses and incorporates a uniform probability of drawdown 
the combined balance of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments is referred to as the allowance for credit losses 
as of december   we had an allowance for credit losses of million  with specific allowances totaling million 
we review the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses and its two components on a quarterly basis 
the estimate of each component is based on observable information and on market and third party data 
table of contents that we believe are reflective of the underlying credit losses being estimated 
these estimates are not based on actual losses related to our loans and may not reflect future performance 
over time  as our loans season  we expect to supplement market and third party data with the actual credit performance of our loans 
in addition  we anticipate that the number of delinquent and non accrual loans and loan impairments and charge offs will increase as our portfolio expands and seasons over time and as the economy continues to weaken 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we provide a base allowance for loans that are not impaired 
we employ a variety of internally developed and third party modeling and estimation tools for measuring credit risk probability of default  loss given default  exposure at default  seasoning and credit migration  which are used in developing an allowance for loan losses on outstanding loans and unfunded loan commitments 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  any required impairment allowances are included in the allowance for loan losses and  as such  may require an additional provision for the relevant period 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we measure impairment of a loan based upon either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  depending on the circumstances and our collection strategy 
as of december   we had impaired loans 
loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and deducted from the allowance 
the provision for credit losses and recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance 
valuation of investments in debt securities we review the fair value of our other debt products quarterly 
the fair value of our investments in debt securities  non investment grade securities and residual securities  are based on independent third party quoted market prices  when available  at the reporting date for those or similar investments 
when no market is available  we estimate fair value using various valuation methodologies  including cash flow analysis and internally generated financial models that incorporate significant assumptions and judgments  as well as qualitative factors 
even if the general accuracy of our valuation models are validated  there are no assurances that our valuations are accurate because of the high number of variables that affect cash flows associated with these complex cash flow structures  which differ on each securitization 
valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of the model 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily ascertainable market value  the fair value of investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
in addition  if our estimates or assumptions with respect to these assets prove to be incorrect  we may be required to write down some or all of the value of these assets 
a debt product is considered impaired when the fair value of the debt product declines below its amortized cost 
the cost basis of the investment is then written down to fair value 
if management determines the impairment to be temporary  it is recorded in other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
if management determines the impairment to be permanent  it is recorded as an offset to other income on our statements of operations 
from time to time we may become aware of cash flow or credit issues with respect to our other debt products and these other debt products are then monitored by management to determine if a write down is appropriate 
although we view write downs of our other debt products as a normal and anticipated aspect of our business  material write downs of the fair value of our other debt products could adversely affect our results of 
table of contents operations and financial condition 
as of december   we had two debt products that were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
as a result  during we recorded an impairment charge  or write down  in other income of million related to these debt products 
our allowance for credit losses does not cover these write downs because we classify these assets as available for sale and are accounted for under the guidelines of fas no 
and eitf in the past  we invested in the rmbs market and are exposed to changes in the credit performance of the mortgage loans underlying these investment securities 
as of december   we had completely written off our rmbs debt products 
the performance of our investment securities may be negatively impacted by  among other things  the timing of losses  higher than expected levels of credit losses or prepayment speeds on the underlying mortgages or home equity loans  depending on the specific structure of each securitization 
most of our investments are in classes of securities which are not actively traded in secondary markets or have lower levels of liquidity 
the fair value of securities and other investments that have such liquidity characteristics may not be readily ascertained 
this situation may be further exacerbated by current market conditions 
the description of certain instruments as debt securities is intended to describe the accounting treatment of those instruments and is not a characterization of those instruments as securities for any other purpose 
valuation of residual interest in securitization we review the fair value of our residual interest in the non recourse  off balance sheet financing vehicle quarterly 
the fair value of our residual interest is based on forecasted cash flows  discount rates  expected credit losses and prepayment speeds for the individual loans and securities 
we recognize changes in the fair value of the residual interest as gains or losses on our statement of operations 
in addition  the fair value determined at any time may not be accurate due to a high number of variables that affect cash flows associated with these complex cash flow structures 
our determination of fair value will be highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of our internal cash flow model 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that currently may not have a readily ascertainable market value  the fair value of investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for the residual interest  and the differences could be material 
in addition  if our estimates or assumptions with respect to these assets prove to be incorrect  we may be required to write down some or all of the value of the residual interest  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our assumptions as to discount rate and future cash flows on the individual assets may be higher or lower than those that might be employed by a third party 
to value the assets  we use historical performance data at the time of determination and assumptions about delinquencies  losses  severities and prepayment speeds in the future  including assumptions about the timing of these variables  in arriving at estimates of future cash flows on the individual assets 
these assumptions are influenced by historical experience in the respective asset classes and with particular originations and servicers 
within the various rmbs asset classes  assumptions and methodologies used by us are generally consistent among the various assets within each class and generally consistent with past forecasting techniques used by us 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values on the grant date 
we adopted sfas r using the prospective method 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb  which required the recognition of compensation cost for the excess  if any  of the value of the stock at the grant date or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 

table of contents for awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after january   we estimate the fair value of stock based awards using the black scholes valuation model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions  including expected term and expected price volatility 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the calculated fair value of stock based compensation and the related expense to be recognized 
we expect the changes in our stock price during will impact our price volatility assumption resulting in an adverse affect to our financial statements 
further  for awards that contain performance measures and conditions  we make an assessment  based on management s judgment  of the probability of these conditions being satisfied  which affects the timing and the amount of expense to be recognized 
if our judgment as to whether these conditions are probable of occurrence are not appropriate  the financial statements could be materially affected 
valuation of deferred tax assets we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary 
in performing these reviews we make estimates about future profits and tax planning strategies that would affect future taxable income and the realization of these deferred tax assets 
a change in these assumptions could result in a difference in valuation and impact our results of operations 
on january   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements 
a company can only recognize the tax position in the financial statements if the position is more likely than not to be upheld on audit  based only on the technical merits of the tax position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin also addresses how interest and penalties should be accrued for uncertain tax positions  requiring that interest expense should be recognized in the first period interest would be accrued under the tax law 
the company classifies all interest and penalties on recognized tax benefits as a part of income tax expense 
at january   the company did not have any accrued interest or penalties 
at december   the company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits  and there have been no material changes since adoption 
the company does not expect any significant changes within the next months 
the company files us federal and state income tax returns 
as of december   the company s tax returns for the years ended  and remain subject to examination by the internal revenue service and state tax authorities 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in market values of our loans held for sale  which are carried at lower of cost or market  and our investment in debt securities  available for sale and derivatives  which are carried at fair value 
fair value is defined as the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and for all other investments and derivatives  fair value is determined pursuant to a valuation policy and a consistent valuation process 
where a market quotation is not readily available  we estimate fair value using various valuation methodologies  including cash flow analysis  as well as qualitative factors 
as of december  and  investments in debt securities available for sale totaled million and million  respectively 
at december  and  our net unrealized loss on those debt securities totaled million and million  respectively 
any unrealized gain or loss on these investments is included in other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet  until realized 
interest rate risk represents a market risk exposure to us 
our goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect our net interest income 
interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility to our net interest income caused by changes in market interest rates 
during the normal course of business our lending to clients and our investments in debt securities create some interest rate risk as does the impact of ever changing market conditions 
our management attempts to mitigate this risk through our asset liability committee alco process taking into consideration balance sheet dynamics such as loan and investment growth and pricing  changes in funding mix and maturity characteristics 
the alco group reviews the overall rate risk position and strategy on an ongoing basis 
the alco group also reviews the impact on net interest income caused by changes in the shape of the yield curve as well as parallel shifts in the yield curve 
we invested the proceeds from our december initial public offering and our november private placement in short term instruments to permit us ready access to cash in order to fund our directly originated loan growth 
as a result  our sensitivity to interest rate movement has increased 
as the cash is redeployed and we continue to grow our loan portfolio  this interest rate sensitivity as a percentage of earnings will decrease over time 
the following table shows the hypothetical estimated change in net interest income for a month period based on changes in the interest rates applied to our portfolio and cash and cash equivalents as of december  our modeling is based on contractual terms and does not consider prepayment rate change basis points estimated change in net interest income over months in thousands decrease of increase of as shown above  we estimate to the best of our ability that a decrease in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in a decrease of million in our annualized net interest income  and an increase in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in an increase in our net interest income of million 
the estimated changes in net interest income reflect the potential effect of interest rate floors on loans totaling approximately million
