item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included as part of this annual report on form k 
operating results factors affecting operating results our results of operations are affected by key factors in each of our business divisions as discussed below 
agribusiness in the agribusiness division  we purchase  store  transport  process and sell agricultural commodities and commodity products 
profitability in this division is affected by the availability and market prices of agricultural commodities and processed commodity products and the availability and costs of energy  transportation and logistics services 
profitability in our agribusiness segment oilseed processing operations is also impacted by capacity utilization rates 
availability of agricultural commodities is affected by many factors  including weather  farmer planting decisions  plant disease  governmental policies and agricultural sector economic conditions 
demand for our agribusiness products is affected by many factors  including changes in global or regional economic conditions  the financial condition of customers  including customer access to credit  worldwide consumption of food products  particularly meat and poultry  changes in population growth rates  changes in per capita incomes  the relative prices of substitute agricultural products  outbreaks of livestock and poultry disease  and  in the past few years  by demand for renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities and commodity products 
we expect that the factors described above will continue to affect global demand for our agribusiness products 
we also expect that  from time to time  imbalances may exist between oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products in certain regions  which impacts our decisions regarding whether  when and where to purchase  store  transport  process or sell these commodities  including whether to change the location of or adjust our own oilseed processing capacity 
fertilizer in the fertilizer division  demand for our products is affected by the profitability of the brazilian agricultural sector  the availability of credit to farmers in brazil  agricultural commodity prices  international fertilizer prices  the types of crops planted  the number of acres planted  the quality of the land under cultivation and weather related issues affecting the success of the harvest 
in addition  our profitability is impacted by international selling prices for imported fertilizers and fertilizer raw materials  such as phosphate  sulfur  ammonia and urea  and ocean freight rates and other import fees 
the brazilian fertilizer business is also a seasonal business with fertilizer sales normally concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to the timing of the major brazilian agricultural cycle 
as a result  we generally import and mine raw materials and produce finished goods during the first half of the year in preparation for the main brazilian cultivation season that occurs during the second half of the year 
food products in the food products division  which consists of our edible oil products and milling products segments  our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials  such as crude vegetable oils and grains  the mix of products we sell  changes in eating habits  changes in per capita 
table of contents incomes  consumer purchasing power levels  availability of credit to commercial customers  governmental dietary guidelines and policies  changes in general economic conditions and the competitive environment in our markets 
in addition to the above industry related factors  our results of operations are affected by the following factors foreign currency exchange rates due to the global nature of our operations  our operating results can be materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates 
both translation of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements and foreign currency transactions affect our results 
local currency based subsidiary statements of income and cash flows are translated monthly into us dollars for consolidation purposes based on weighted average exchange rates during the period 
therefore  fluctuations of local currencies versus the us dollar during a reporting period impact our consolidated statements of income and cash flows for that period and also affect comparisons between periods 
our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars from local currency at period end exchange rates  and we record the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
included in other comprehensive income for the year ended december  were foreign exchange net translation losses of  million  and for the years ended december  and were foreign exchange net translation gains of million and million  respectively  from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities 
additionally  we record transaction gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in non functional currencies 
these us dollar denominated amounts must be remeasured into their respective subsidiary functional currencies at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date  with the resulting gains or losses included in the subsidiary s statement of income and therefore in our consolidated statements of income as a foreign exchange gain loss 
from time to time  we also enter into derivative instruments  such as foreign currency forward contracts  swaps and options  to limit exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and our local currency operating expenses 
these derivative instruments are marked to market  with changes in their fair value recognized as a component of foreign exchange in our consolidated statements of income 
we may also hedge other foreign currency exposures as deemed appropriate 
during the first half of  the us dollar continued a trend that began in early and weakened against most major global currencies 
this trend reversed during the third quarter of and the dollar strengthened through december  in particular  the brazilian real appreciated against the us dollar through june  and then depreciated relative to the us dollar from july  through december  for the full year  the real depreciated against the us dollar at december  when compared to the rate at december  and the average real us dollar exchange rate was r  compared to r in  which represents a strengthening in in the average value of the real versus the us dollar 
the real appreciated against the us dollar at december  when compared to the rate at december  in  the average real us dollar exchange rate was r  compared to r in  which represents a strengthening in in the average value of the real versus the us dollar 
we use long term intercompany loans to reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in brazil  particularly their effects on our results of operations 
these loans do not require cash payment of principal and are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  the foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
this is in contrast to foreign exchange 
table of contents gains or losses on third party debt and short term intercompany debt  which are recorded in foreign exchange gains losses in our consolidated statements of income 
agribusiness segment brazil 
our agribusiness sales are us dollar denominated or us dollar linked 
in addition  commodity inventories in our agribusiness segment are stated at market value  which is generally linked to us dollar based international prices 
as a result  these commodity inventories provide a natural offset to our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates in our agribusiness segment 
appreciation of the real against the us dollar generally has a negative effect on our agribusiness segment results in brazil  as real denominated industrial costs  which are included in cost of goods sold  and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are translated to us dollars at stronger us dollar exchange rates  which results in higher us dollar costs 
in addition  appreciation of the real generates losses based on the changes in the real denominated value of our commodity inventories  which are reflected in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income 
however  appreciation of the real also generates offsetting net foreign exchange gains on the net us dollar monetary liability position of our brazilian agribusiness subsidiaries  which are reflected in foreign exchange gains losses in our consolidated statements of income 
as our brazilian subsidiaries are primarily funded with  us dollar denominated debt  the mark to market losses on the commodity inventories during periods of real appreciation generally offset the foreign exchange gains on the us dollar denominated debt 
the converse is true for devaluations of the real and the related effect on our consolidated financial statements 
fertilizer segment brazil 
our fertilizer segment sales prices are linked to us dollar priced international fertilizer prices 
mining  industrial and sg a expenses are real denominated costs 
inventories in our fertilizer segment are not marked to market but are accounted at the lower of average historical cost basis or market 
these inventories are generally financed with us dollar denominated liabilities 
appreciation of the real against the us dollar generally results in higher mining  industrial and sg a expenses when translated into us dollars and net foreign exchange gains on the net us dollar monetary liability position of our fertilizer segment subsidiaries 
gross profit margins are generally adversely affected if the real appreciates during the year as our local currency sales revenues are based on us dollar international fertilizer prices  whereas our cost of goods sold would reflect the higher real cost of inventories acquired and production costs incurred when the real was weaker 
inventories are generally acquired and in the first half of the year  whereas sales of fertilizer products are generally concentrated in the second half of the year 
therefore  the recording of exchange gains on the net us dollar monetary liability position and the effects of the appreciating real on our gross profit margins generally do not occur in the same reporting period  with the foreign exchange impact on the debt reflected monthly in our results while the impact on gross profit margins is reflected at the time products are sold 
the converse is true for devaluations of the real and the related effect on our consolidated financial statements 
edible oil and milling products segments brazil 
our food products businesses are generally local currency businesses 
the costs of raw materials  principally wheat and vegetable oils  are largely us dollar linked and changes in the costs of these raw materials have historically been passed through to the customer in the form of higher or lower selling prices 
however  delays or difficulties in passing through changes in raw materials costs into local currency selling prices can affect our margins 
other operations 
our operations in europe are in countries that are members of the european union and several countries that are not members of the european union 
our risk management policy is to fully hedge our monetary exposures to minimize the financial effects of fluctuations in the euro and other european currencies 
we also operate in argentina  where we are exposed to the peso  and in asia  where our primary exposures are to the chinese yuan renminbi and the indian rupee 
our risk management policy is to fully hedge our monetary exposure to the financial effects of fluctuations in the values of these currencies relative to the us dollar 

table of contents income taxes as a bermuda exempted company  we are not subject to income taxes on income in our jurisdiction of incorporation 
however  our subsidiaries  which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions  are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates ranging from to 
determination of taxable income requires the interpretation of related and often complex tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we operate and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events 
as a result of our significant business activities in south america  our effective tax rate is impacted by relative foreign exchange differences between the us dollar and the brazilian real 
a strengthening in the dollar relative to the real currently results in a beneficial effective tax rate impact 
conversely  a weaker dollar to the real currently results in an increased effective tax rate 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
among other tax guidance  fin requires applying a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de recognition of tax benefits 
we recorded tax liabilities of million in our consolidated balance sheet at january  related to unrecognized tax benefits  of which million relates to accrued penalties and interest 
at december  and  respectively we recorded tax liabilities of million and million in other non current liabilities and million and million in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  of which million and million relates to accrued penalties and interest 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 
during and  respectively  we recognized million and million in interest and penalties in our consolidated statements of income 
in  we merged and spun off several owned european subsidiaries which generated statutory capital tax losses and the recognition of million of net operating loss carryforwards 
we had determined that it was more likely than not that the tax authorities would disallow the recognition of the statutory capital tax losses 
consequently  in  we recorded a valuation allowance of million 
in  tax authorities conducted audits of the tax returns of the applicable entities which included the statutory capital tax losses and no additional tax assessment was made by the tax authorities 
in addition  the statute of limitations for auditing tax returns relating to the applicable returns that included the statutory capital tax losses expired on january  as a result  we reversed deferred tax valuation allowances of million in  as it was determined to be more likely than not that the net operating losses will be recovered 
the increase from the amount recorded in of million compared to the million reversed in represents the effects of foreign exchange translation adjustments 
we have in the past obtained tax benefits under us tax laws providing incentives under the provisions of the extraterritorial income act eti legislation 
however  the jobs creation act ultimately repealed the eti benefit in a gradual manner that resulted in the eti benefit being phased out completely in the eti benefit has been replaced with an income tax deduction intended to allocate benefits previously provided to us exporters across all manufacturers when fully phased in 
although most of our us operations qualify as manufacturing  we do not expect to receive significant benefits from this new tax legislation primarily due to our current us tax position 
income tax benefit in includes a charge of million relating to a correction of certain tax benefits recognized from to related to incentives under the eti provision of the us internal revenue code 
internal control over financial reporting in connection with the year end closing process  we determined that there were certain errors in our previously issued unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements  which resulted in an overstatement of net sales and costs of goods sold for the affected periods 
these errors had no 
table of contents effect on bunge s previously reported volumes  gross profit  segment operating profit  net income or earnings per share or on bunge s balance sheets or statements of cash flows for the affected periods 
we determined that the identified causes of these errors represented two material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting 
we have remediated these weaknesses as of december  see item a 
controls and procedures for more information 
results of operations overview our net income and total segment ebit represented a company record  with net income higher and total segment ebit higher than the year presented a highly volatile industry environment  particularly in our agribusiness and fertilizer operations 
during the first half of the year  agricultural commodity prices reached historically high levels as a result of a variety of factors  including tight supplies resulting from prior year crop production shortfalls in certain regions  and supply disruptions in argentina caused by protracted farmer strikes  as well as record high energy prices and a weak us dollar 
demand for our products was strong  driven by global growth trends  particularly  rising standards of living in developing countries 
international fertilizer prices also rose to record levels in the first half of the year  leading farmers in south america to accelerate purchases of fertilizer in expectation of continued rising prices 
after reaching a peak in mid july   agricultural commodity prices fell sharply as demand began declining in response to high prices and prospects of large crops in the northern hemisphere increased supply estimates 
the global financial crisis that occurred in the second half of increased price pressures as global credit constraints further inhibited customer demand and also led to a global decline in economic activity 
farmers became reluctant to sell crops in expectation that prices would rise  ocean freight rates declined from record levels to at or below vessel scrap values  fertilizer sales volumes declined due to credit constraints affecting the brazilian farm sector  as well as a volatile agricultural commodity  currency  and fertilizer price environment  certain counterparties struggled to meet high priced commodity purchase and other contractual commitments and most major global currencies devalued relative to the us dollar 
in this volatile environment  our agribusiness segment ebit increased by compared with the majority of the increase came from strong margins across most of our agribusiness operations in the first half of the year and million of credits resulting from favorable rulings related to certain transactional taxes in brazil 
these increases were partially offset by foreign exchange losses primarily from the impact of the real devaluation on us dollar financing of working capital in brazil and by million of counterparty risk provisions  including increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts and mark to market valuation adjustments on commodity and other derivative contracts 
impairment and restructuring charges as part of our continuing efforts to reduce costs and improve capacity utilization by closing smaller  older and less efficient plants totaled million and million in and  respectively 
our fertilizer segment ebit represented a record and was higher than last year  despite a decline in volumes compared with margins were significantly higher in as a result of high international fertilizer and fertilizer raw material prices throughout the year 
higher margins were partially offset by foreign exchange losses on the us dollar financing of working capital and by the impact of lower volumes  primarily in the fourth quarter  driven by a combination of a tight farmer credit environment and weak demand caused primarily by volatility in fertilizer and commodity prices and foreign exchange rates 
fertilizer segment ebit for was negatively impacted by a million provision related to recoverable taxes as changes in tax laws in certain brazilian states within brazil made recovery in those states uncertain 

table of contents edible oil products segment ebit for was a loss of million compared to earnings of million last year 
ebit declined primarily due to higher selling  general and administrative expenses  foreign exchange losses and lower affiliate results in europe 
in addition  results were negatively impacted by high raw material prices which could not be fully recovered  particularly in europe due to government price controls in certain countries and aggressive product pricing by competitors 
edible oil products segment ebit included impairment and restructuring charges of million and million in and  respectively 
milling segment ebit for more than doubled compared with primarily due to higher wheat milling margins as a result of wheat volumes purchased prior to the wheat price rally 
wheat milling margin improvements were partially offset by weaker corn milling margins 
ebit for the milling segment was impacted by impairment and restructuring charges of million in due to the closing of a wheat milling facility 
segment results in  bunge re evaluated the profitability measure of its segments operating performance and determined that segment operating performance based on segment earnings before interest and taxes ebit is a more meaningful profitability measure than segment operating profit  since the segment earnings before interest and taxes reflects equity in earnings of affiliates and minority interest and excludes income taxes 
as a result  amounts for and contained in this annual report on form k have been restated 
a summary of certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment for the periods indicated is set forth below

table of contents year ended december  percent change percent change us in millions  except percentages depreciation  depletion and amortization agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products total net income total segment earnings before interest and tax ebit is an operating performance measure used by bunge s management to evaluate its segments operating activities 
total segment ebit is a non gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace net income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
bunge s management believes total segment ebit is a useful measure of its segments operating profitability  since the measure reflects equity in earnings of affiliates and minority interest and excludes income tax 
income tax is excluded as bunge s management believes income tax is not material to the operating performance of its segments 
in addition  interest income and expense have become less meaningful to the segments operating activities 
total segment ebit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other measure of consolidated operating results under us gaap 
a reconciliation of total segment ebit to net income follows year ended december  us in millions total segment earnings before interest and tax interest income interest expense income tax minority interest share of interest and tax net income compared to agribusiness segment 
agribusiness segment net sales increased due primarily to historically high market prices during much of for agricultural commodities and commodity products in our portfolio 
volumes increased by from primarily as a result of higher exported volumes from the united states and expansion of our sugar business  partially offset by lower oilseed processing and distribution volumes as a result of softer demand for animal feed and vegetable oils in the second half of the year 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to historically high agricultural commodity prices during much of the year  higher energy and transportation costs  and million of mark to market valuation adjustments related to counterparty risk on commodity and other derivative contracts 
partially offsetting these increases were million of transactional tax credits in brazil and the positive impact of the brazilian real year over year depreciation on the mark to market valuation of readily marketable inventories held by our brazilian subsidiary 
cost of goods sold in included million in restructuring and impairment charges compared to million in 
table of contents gross profit increased as a result of stronger margins across most of our agribusiness portfolio  particularly in the first half of  the increase in volumes  and the transactional tax credits of million as a result of a favorable tax ruling in brazil 
these increases were partially offset by million of mark to market valuation adjustments related to counterparty risk on commodity and other derivative contracts 
sg a increased primarily due to expanded activities in new product lines such as sugar  higher provisions for bad debts  particularly in the last quarter of the year with heightened credit and counterparty risk as a result of the global economic downturn  higher performance based compensation costs  and the impact of foreign exchange translation of local currency expenses into us dollars 
sg a expenses were reduced by million of transactional tax credits in brazil resulting from a favorable ruling during related to certain transactional taxes in brazil 
foreign exchange losses reflected mainly the impact of the brazilian real depreciation on the net us dollar monetary liability position in brazil compared to gains in resulting from appreciation of the brazilian real 
foreign exchange gains and losses in our agribusiness segment were substantially offset by the currency impact on inventory mark to market valuations  which were included in cost of goods sold 
equity in earnings of affiliates increased in due to improved results in our biodiesel joint venture in europe and in our argentine port terminal and soybean processing joint ventures 
minority interest decreased due to lower results in non wholly owned subsidiaries  largely in china  partially offset by improved earnings in our oilseed processing operation in poland 
other income expense for decreased from due primarily to a gain of million from the sale of shares held in cme group  an entity created by the merger of the chicago mercantile exchange and the chicago board of trade 
other income expense for included a provision of million for an adverse ruling related to a brazilian social security claim 
agribusiness segment ebit increased primarily as a result of the factors discussed above 
fertilizer segment 
fertilizer segment net sales increased  despite a reduction in volumes  as a result of historically high international fertilizer prices  with increases averaging approximately compared to volume declines primarily related to lower demand and our decision to restrict credit extension to farmers as a result of weak economic conditions in the fourth quarter of  which resulted primarily from tight credit availability for brazilian farmers as a result of the global financial crisis 
cost of goods sold increased compared with  despite the reduction in volumes  due to higher international prices for imported fertilizer raw materials 
costs were also affected by higher maintenance and storage costs  higher depreciation expense and foreign exchange translation of local currency costs into us dollars 
cost of goods sold for included a million provision related to recoverable taxes as changes in tax laws in certain brazilian states made recovery in those states uncertain 
gross profit increased due to strong margins as a result of higher international prices  which more than offset lower volumes 
sg a expenses in were flat compared with with benefits from lower bad debt expenses and the elimination of certain brazilian transactional taxes in december offset by increased tax and legal provisions and the impact of translation of local currency expenses into us dollars 
foreign exchange losses were million in compared to gains of million in these losses were caused primarily by the impact of the weaker brazilian real on us dollar 
table of contents denominated financings of working capital 
the brazilian real appreciated during the exchange results are offset in the gross margin when the inventories are sold 
equity in earnings of affiliates was million in compared to million in losses in due to higher results from fosbrasil  our brazilian joint venture which produces purified phosphoric acid 
minority interest increased by due to higher earnings at fosfertil 
segment ebit increased as a result of the factors described above 
edible oil products segment 
edible oil products segment net sales increased primarily due to higher average selling prices  following the historically high agricultural commodity prices experienced during volumes increased largely driven by increased sales of bulk and packaged oil in canada  bulk oil in argentina and expansion of our edible oil business in europe and china 
cost of goods sold increased as a result of higher raw material prices  higher volumes and foreign exchange translation of local currency costs into us dollars 
cost of goods sold also included impairment charges relating to certain refining and packaging facilities totaling million in europe in and million in in europe and the united states 
gross profit increased as a result of higher average selling prices and volumes 
these factors were partially offset by higher raw material costs which could not be fully recovered  particularly in europe due to government price controls in certain countries and aggressive product pricing by competitors 
sg a increased primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange translation of local currency expenses into us dollars 
higher employee related costs and costs to support business growth in asia and europe also increased sg a expenses 
sg a for included a million credit resulting from a favorable ruling related to certain transactional taxes in brazil 
in  sg a included million of impairment charges related to the write down of certain brands and related intangible assets in india 
foreign exchange losses totaled million in compared to gains of million in primarily due to the impact of the weaker brazilian real and several european currencies on the us dollar denominated financing of working capital 
equity in earnings of affiliates decreased due to lower results at saipol  bunge s european edible oil joint venture 
minority interest increased due to higher results in non wholly owned subsidiaries  mainly in poland 
other income expense included a million gain on a land sale in north america in segment ebit decreased from million in to a loss of million in due to the factors described above

cost of goods sold for included an million credit resulting from a favorable ruling related to certain transactional taxes in brazil 
cost of goods sold for included million of impairment charges relating to the closure of an older  higher cost wheat mill 

table of contents gross profit increased primarily as a result of higher net sales and as a result of significant wheat volumes purchased prior to the wheat price rally 
the increase also included the million transactional tax credit in brazil in compared to million of impairment charges in sg a expenses increased primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange translation of the brazilian real into us dollars  and higher employee related costs 
segment ebit increased to million in from million in as a result of the factors described above 
interest 
a summary of consolidated interest income and expense for the periods indicated follows year ended december  us in millions  except percentages change interest income interest expense interest income increased primarily due to higher average interest bearing cash balances 
interest expense increased due to higher average borrowings resulting from increased working capital requirements as a result of higher commodity prices  partially offset by lower average interest rates in compared with income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased million to million in from million in despite an increase in income from operations before income tax of million 
the effective tax rate for was compared to for largely as a result of higher earnings in lower tax jurisdictions 
the lower effective tax rate reflects the benefits of the real depreciation against the us dollar and tax credits primarily in europe and brazil  offset by valuation allowances  primarily in europe 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
during  we recorded an income tax expense relating to unrecognized tax benefits of million 
the increase related primarily to the appreciation of the brazilian real compared to the us dollar on amounts recorded for the possible realization of certain brazilian deferred tax assets 
during  we recorded a reduction of income tax expense relating to unrecognized tax benefits of million  which related primarily to the depreciation of the brazilian real compared to the us dollar on amounts recorded for the possible realization of these brazilian deferred tax assets 
we requested a ruling on the realization of these deferred tax assets from the applicable tax authorities in if the ruling is favorable  our liability related to this unrecognized tax benefit will be reversed 
net income 
net income increased from million in to a company record of  million in net income for included million related to favorable rulings related to certain transactional taxes in brazil and million of net gains on asset acquisitions dispositions compared to net gains of million in 
net income for was reduced by net impairment and restructuring charges of million compared with million in net income for also was reduced by an after tax provision of million resulting from a change in tax regulations in several brazilian states 
compared to agribusiness segment 
agribusiness segment net sales increased primarily due to higher market prices for most agricultural commodities and commodity products in our portfolio 
volumes increased by  primarily in grain origination  as higher commodity prices led to improved farm 
table of contents economics  particularly in brazil  and stimulated increased plantings and farmer selling activities 
grain and oilseed distribution volumes were also higher with weather related crop reductions  particularly in oilseed  corn and wheat production in europe and wheat production in australia  creating dislocations in the normal global flows of oilseeds and grains 
these dislocations enabled us to utilize our global asset network and our logistics assets and capabilities to supply european customers from our grain and oilseed facilities in north and south america 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to historically high market prices for most agricultural commodity raw materials as well as higher ocean freight costs and the impact of a weaker us dollar  particularly against the brazilian real  on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
the average brazilian real us dollar exchange rate strengthened by in the year ended december  compared to in addition  included impairment and restructuring charges of million compared to charges of million in gross profit increased due to the increase in volumes and improved origination and processing margins 
sg a expenses increased by primarily due to increased support and administration costs for new product lines  such as sugar  information system implementations in brazil and certain european countries  increased performance based compensation costs and the impact of a weaker us dollar on foreign local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
foreign exchange gains on net us dollar monetary liability positions in brazil of million in resulted from the appreciation of the brazilian real during the year and significantly higher working capital amounts resulting from higher commodity prices and increased volumes 
in  despite some volatility of the brazilian real  the year over year appreciation was and the average working capital was lower than foreign exchange gains and losses are substantially offset by inventory mark to market adjustments  which were included in cost of goods sold 
equity in earnings of affiliates was million compared with a loss of million in primarily due to higher results in solae as a result of margin improvement in china and europe 
solae s earnings were low as a result of impairment and restructuring charges relating to the closure of a plant in china and employee severance costs and impairment charges relating to certain patent  technology and trademark investments and intangible assets no longer used in the business 
partially offsetting the increase from solae were lower earnings from our european biodiesel joint ventures 
minority interest expenses increased million to million in primarily due to higher earnings in our non wholly owned subsidiaries in poland  china and also due to increases in a private investment fund controlled by bunge  which began in other income relates primarily to a gain of million on the sale of shares held in cme group  an entity created by the merger of the chicago mercantile exchange and the chicago board of trade 
segment ebit increased by to million  primarily due to higher margins  increased volumes and foreign exchange gains  partially offset by higher sg a expenses 
fertilizer segment 
fertilizer segment net sales increased primarily due to higher average selling prices resulting from high international fertilizer prices  particularly during the last half of the year  and a increase in volumes 
the volume increase was due primarily to higher crop prices  which improved brazilian farm economics and encouraged farmers to increase plantings and fertilizer applications to improve crop yields 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to higher prices of imported fertilizer raw materials used in our production processes 
costs were also higher due to the impact of the stronger brazilian real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars compared to and a 
table of contents million provision related to recoverable taxes as changes in tax laws in certain brazilian states made recovery in those states uncertain 
gross profit increased by primarily due to higher average selling prices that were only partially offset by higher raw material costs  which had been carried earlier in the year at lower prices 
sg a expenses increased primarily due to increased bad debt provisions  increased performance based compensation expenses and the impact of the stronger brazilian real on local costs when translated to us dollars 
foreign exchange gains for of million were significantly higher than  primarily due to exchange gains from our programs to hedge the negative impact on results of a stronger brazilian real on cost of goods sold and sg a expenses 
the effect of brazilian real appreciation on us dollar denominated financing of working capital also generated exchange gains 
minority interest increased to million in from million in primarily due to record earnings in fosfertil 
segment ebit increased to million in from million in primarily driven by improved margins and higher volumes 
edible oil products segment 
edible oil products segment net sales increased due to significantly higher average selling prices and a increase in volumes 
volumes increased in most regions  with the largest increases in brazil  eastern europe and asia 
the increase in average selling prices followed the trend in agricultural commodity prices 
cost of goods sold increased due to higher raw material costs and increased volumes 
costs were also negatively impacted by the effects of a weaker us dollar on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
cost of goods sold in also included million of impairment charges relating to write downs of certain facilities in europe and the united states 
included in cost of goods sold in were million of impairment charges relating to the write down of certain refining and packaging facilities in our brazilian edible oil operations 
gross profit increased primarily due to improved profitability and higher volumes in brazilian packaged oils and in europe 
our new growth initiatives in asia also contributed to our results in in addition  gross profit was negatively impacted by impairment charges 
sg a expenses increased primarily due to increases in europe and asia supporting planned growth in our edible oil operations in those regions and to million of impairment charges related to the write down of certain brands and related intangible assets in india 
expenses were also impacted by the effects of a weaker us dollar on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
equity in earnings of affiliates in was million  essentially unchanged from as higher results from our french oilseed processing joint venture related to their sale of a subsidiary was offset by lower results in other joint ventures 
minority interest was positive in by million compared with a reduction to net income of million in due to losses recorded this year by our non wholly owned subsidiary in poland 
other income expenses was million in and included a loss on an asset sale 
other income of million in related to a gain on a sale of land in europe 
segment ebit decreased compared to primarily due to higher sg a expenses and million in impairment charges  which more than offset higher gross profit in milling products segment 
milling products segment net sales increased primarily due to higher average selling prices for wheat and corn milling products  combined with a modest increase in volumes 
higher average selling prices in wheat and corn milling products were primarily caused by 
table of contents weather related reductions in global wheat and increased consumption of corn from the us ethanol industry  as product prices generally move in relation to the cost of raw materials 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to higher raw material costs and million of impairment charges in relating to the closure of an older  higher cost mill 
costs were also negatively impacted by the effects of a stronger brazilian real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
raw material cost increases were higher following the trend in wheat and corn prices 
gross profit decreased primarily due to the impairment charges in sg a increased as a result of higher labor related costs  increases in advertising expenses and the effects of a weaker us dollar on local currency costs 
equity in earnings of affiliates increased to million from million in due to improved results from our mexican joint venture

readily marketable inventories 
readily marketable inventories are agricultural commodity inventories  such as soybeans  soybean meal  soybean oil  corn and wheat  that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics  widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms 
readily marketable inventories of  million at december  and  million at december  were included in our agribusiness segment inventories for each period 
in addition  inventories at fair market value of million and million were included in our edible oil products segment inventories at december  and respectively 
the decrease in readily marketable inventories at december  compared to december  was primarily due to the general decline in commodity prices that occurred during the second half of we recorded interest expense on debt financing readily marketable inventories of million  million and million in the years ended december   and financing arrangements and outstanding indebtedness 
we conduct most of our financing activities through a centralized financing structure  designed to act as our central treasury  which enables us and our subsidiaries to borrow more efficiently 
this structure includes a master trust facility  the primary assets of which consist of intercompany loans made to bunge limited and its subsidiaries 
certain of bunge limited s owned subsidiaries fund the master trust with long and short term debt obtained from third parties  including through our commercial paper program and certain credit facilities  as well as the issuance of senior notes 
borrowings by these subsidiaries carry full  unconditional guarantees by bunge limited 

table of contents revolving credit facilities 
at december   we had an aggregate of approximately  million of available  committed borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities 
the following table summarizes these facilities and outstanding amounts as of the periods presented total availability borrowings outstanding commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities maturities december  december  december  us in millions commercial paper short term revolving credit facilities long term revolving credit facilities total borrowings under the revolving credit facilities whose maturities are greater than one year from the date of the consolidated balance sheets are classified as long term debt  consistent with the long term maturity of the underlying facilities 
however  individual borrowings under the revolving credit facilities are generally short term in nature  bear interest at variable rates and can be repaid or renewed as each such individual borrowing matures 
during  one participant bank with a commitment of million in a million syndicated revolving credit facility maturing in was placed into state receivership  and accordingly  total availability under such facility has been reduced by the bank s commitment amount 
included in this amount is our million  five year revolving credit facility maturing in june discussed further below 
our million commercial paper program is supported by committed back up bank credit lines of million we refer to such back up bank credit lines as the liquidity facility provided by lending institutions that are rated at least a by standard poors and p by moody s investor services 
the liquidity facility  which matures in june  permits bunge  at its option  to set up direct borrowings or issue commercial paper in an aggregate amount of up to million 
the cost of borrowing under the liquidity facility would typically be higher than the cost of borrowing under our commercial paper program 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under the liquidity facility or the commercial paper program 
in march  we entered into a million  three year  syndicated revolving credit agreement with a number of lending institutions that matures in april the interest rate for borrowings under this facility is libor plus to  determined based on the credit ratings of our long term unsecured debt at the time of the borrowing 
as of december   the interest rate for borrowings under this facility would have been libor plus  however  there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  in november  we entered into an million  day  syndicated revolving credit agreement with a number of lending institutions 
this facility replaced the then existing billion revolving credit facility dated as of november  which matured in accordance with its terms on november  subject to obtaining commitments from existing or new lenders and satisfying other conditions in the revolving credit agreement  we may increase the aggregate commitments under this credit agreement to billion 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  which matures in november  will bear interest  at our option  at libor plus the applicable margin defined below or at the alternate base rate then in effect plus the applicable margin minus 
the applicable 
table of contents margin for purposes of this revolving credit agreement will be based on the greater of i a yearly floor rate that varies between and  based generally on the credit ratings of our senior long term unsecured debt and ii a yearly rate calculated as a percentage of the markit cdx 
na 
ig series five year credit default swap index or any successor index thereof that varies between and based generally on the credit ratings of our senior long term unsecured debt 
amounts under this revolving credit agreement that remain undrawn are subject to a commitment fee payable quarterly on the average undrawn portion of the credit agreement at rates ranging from to  which will also vary based on the credit ratings of our senior long term unsecured debt 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  in addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above  from time to time we also enter into uncommitted short term credit lines with lending institutions 
these credit lines are entered into as necessary based on our liquidity requirements 
at december  and december   million and  respectively  were outstanding under such short term credit lines 
these short term credit lines are included in short term debt in our consolidated balance sheets 
our million  five year revolving credit facility and our million  day  revolving credit facility  each referred to above  are scheduled to mature in june and november  respectively 
we intend to renew these facilities on or prior to their respective maturity dates 
due to current tight conditions in the credit markets  we expect to face increased borrowing spreads as well as higher bank fees in connection with these renewals 
short and long term debt 
our short and long term debt decreased by million at december  from december   primarily due to strong cash flow generation during the period resulting from a combination of improved profitability and lower working capital levels 
the decrease in working capital was primarily caused by lower prices for agricultural commodities and actions taken to effectively manage working capital

table of contents in february  we entered into a million syndicated term loan with a group of lending institutions 
the term loan bears interest at a fixed rate of per year and matures in we used the proceeds from this term loan to repay outstanding indebtedness 
during august  we entered into several bilateral term loan agreements with individual banks aggregating million 
these term loans  each of which is set to mature three years from its respective date of funding  are fully funded as of december  and carry interest rates based on libor plus a spread ranging from 
we used the proceeds from these term loans to repay outstanding indebtedness 
in december  we repaid the previously issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due also  in december  we repurchased and cancelled million of the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due credit ratings 
on july   moody s investors service revised the outlook on the baa credit rating of our unsecured guaranteed senior notes to stable from negative 
on june   s p confirmed the bbb stable outlook credit rating on our unsecured guaranteed senior notes 
in addition  fitch ratings currently maintains the credit rating of our unsecured guaranteed senior notes at bbb with a stable outlook 
our debt agreements do not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt 
however  credit rating downgrades would increase our borrowing costs under our credit facilities and  depending on their severity  could affect our ability to renew existing or to obtain new credit facilities or access the capital markets in the future on favorable terms 
we may also be required to post collateral or provide third party credit support under certain agreements as a result of such downgrades 
a significant increase in our borrowing costs could impair our ability to compete effectively in our business relative to competitors with higher credit ratings 
our credit facilities and certain senior notes require us to comply with specified financial covenants related to minimum net worth  minimum current ratio  a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and indebtedness at the subsidiary level 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  interest rate swap agreements 
in  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of million maturing in for the purpose of managing our interest rate exposure associated with our million three year fixed rate term loan due under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements  we make payments based on the average daily effective federal funds rate and receive payments based on a fixed interest rate 
we have accounted for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

in addition  in  we entered into floating to floating currency and interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of billion maturing in for the purpose of managing our currency and interest rate exposure associated with our billion japanese yen term loan due under the terms of the currency and interest rate swap agreements  we make us dollar payments based on three month us dollar libor and receive payments based on three month yen libor 
we have accounted for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
also during  we entered into several interest rate basis swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of million 
these basis swap agreements swap the future libor settings on million of the million  three year  term loans due into the average daily effective federal funds rate prevailing during the respective period plus a spread 
under the terms of the basis swap agreements  we make payments based on the average daily effective federal funds rate and receive payments based on libor 
the basis swap agreements are intended to mitigate the interest rate risk faced by bunge from deviations in future libor rate settings from the expected path 
table of contents of the federal funds policy rates set by the federal reserve 
these basis swap agreements do not meet the requirements prescribed by sfas no 
for hedge accounting 
we have  therefore  not designated these basis swap agreements as hedge instruments  and consequently  changes in fair value of the basis swap agreements are recorded in earnings 
in january  we terminated certain of our then outstanding interest rate hedges with an aggregate notional principal amount of  million maturing in  and and received approximately million in cash  which included a million gain on the net settlement of the swap agreements 
the million gain will be amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the debt

as of december   we had  cumulative mandatory convertible preference shares outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of million 
each mandatory convertible preference share has an initial liquidation preference of  which will be adjusted for any accumulated and unpaid dividends 
the dividend on each mandatory convertible preference share is set at per annum and will be payable quarterly 
as a result of adjustments to the initial conversion rates because cash dividends paid on bunge limited s common shares exceeded certain specified thresholds  each mandatory convertible preference share will automatically convert on december   into between and bunge limited common shares 
each mandatory convertible preference share is also convertible at any time before december   at the holder s option  into bunge limited common shares  subject to certain additional anti dilution adjustments

the convertible preference shares are not redeemable by us at any time 
cash flows our cash flow from operations varies depending on  among other items  the market prices and timing of the purchase and sale of  agribusiness commodity inventories 
generally  during periods when commodity prices are rising  our agribusiness operations require increased use of cash to support working capital to acquire inventories and daily settlement requirements on exchange traded futures that we use to minimize price risk related to our inventories 
in addition  in the first half of the year we experience more use of cash to build fertilizer inventories in anticipation of sales to farmers who typically purchase the bulk of their fertilizer needs in the second half of the year 
the cash flow needs of our food products division will vary based on the market prices and timing of the purchase of the raw materials used in those businesses 
compared to in  our net cash and cash equivalents increased million  reflecting the net impact of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  compared to a million increase in our net cash and cash equivalents in our operating activities provided cash of  million in  compared to cash used of million in our cash flow from operations varies depending on the timing of the acquisition of  and the market prices for  agribusiness commodity inventories and the existence of a positive carrying structure in the market for agricultural commodities  which encourages commodity merchandisers to hold inventories 
generally  during periods when commodity prices are high  our operations require increased levels of working capital and our customers will  in many cases  reduce the volume of agricultural commodity forward sales contracts with us in anticipation that prices will decline 
as a result  we are dependent on exchange traded futures to minimize the effects of changes in the prices of agricultural commodities on our agribusiness inventories and forward commodity purchase contracts 
the majority of our exchange traded futures are settled in cash on a daily basis 
as a result of the rising prices of agricultural commodities during the first half of  we experienced significant cash payment obligations related to these daily settlements 
in addition  our food products raw material costs also increased during the first half of as a result of the higher commodity prices 
in the second half of  agricultural prices fell sharply  resulting in an inflow of cash during this period from daily settlements of exchange traded futures positions 
our operating subsidiaries are primarily funded with us dollar denominated debt 
the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries is generally the local currency and the financial statements are calculated in the functional currency and translated into us dollars 
these us dollar denominated loans are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates at the applicable balance sheet date 
the resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as a foreign exchange gain or loss 
for the years ended december  and  we had a million loss and a million gain  respectively  on debt denominated in us dollars at our subsidiaries  which was included as an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash provided by used for operating activities in the line item foreign exchange gain on debt in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

table of contents this adjustment is required because the cash flow impacts of these gains or losses are recognized as financing activities when the subsidiary repays the underlying us dollar denominated debt and therefore have no impact on cash flows from operations 
cash used for investing activities was  million in  compared to cash used of million in payments made for capital expenditures in included primarily investments in property  plant and equipment as described under capital expenditures

dividends paid to our common shareholders in were million and million in dividends paid to holders of our convertible preference shares were million in brazilian farmer credit background 
we advance funds to farmer suppliers  primarily in brazil  through secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity contracts 
we also sell fertilizer to farmer customers  primarily in brazil  on credit as described below and provide financial guarantees in support of customer obligations to third parties 
the ability of our customers and suppliers to repay these amounts is affected by local farm sector economic conditions 
brazilian farm economics in and were significantly adversely affected by volatility in soybean prices  a steadily appreciating brazilian real and  in certain regions  poor crop quality and yields 
certain brazilian farmers responded to these conditions by delaying payments owed to farm input suppliers and lenders  including us 
although higher crop prices contributed to an improvement in brazilian farm sector economics beginning in  some brazilian farmers continue to face economic headwinds from high unpaid debt balances and a strong brazilian real during most of in addition  crop input prices  including fertilizers  increased significantly during and continued to increase in the first half of  further pressuring farming economics 
accordingly  in certain instances  as described further below  we have renegotiated certain past due accounts receivable to extend the customer payment terms over longer periods and have initiated legal proceedings against certain customers to collect amounts owed which are in default 
in addition  we have tightened our credit policies to reduce extensions of credit to higher risk accounts  and have increased collateral requirements for certain customers 

table of contents because brazilian farmer credit exposures are denominated in local currency  reported values are impacted by movements in the value of the brazilian real against the us dollar 
in  the real devalued by  decreasing the reported translated us dollar balances 
fertilizer segment accounts receivable 
in our fertilizer segment  customer accounts receivable typically have repayment terms ranging from to days 
as the farmer s cash flow is seasonal and is typically generated after the crop is harvested  the actual due dates of the accounts receivable are individually determined based upon when a farmer purchases our fertilizer products and the anticipated date for the harvest and sale of the farmer s crop 
the payment terms for these accounts receivable are sometimes renegotiated if there is a crop failure or the cash flows generated from the harvest are not adequate for the farmer to repay balances due to us 
we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable and record allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful 
we base our determination of the allowance on analyses of credit quality of individual accounts  considering also the economic and financial condition of the farming industry and other market conditions 
we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in brazil and will adjust this allowance from time to time depending upon the circumstances 
in addition to our fertilizer trade accounts receivable  we issue guarantees to third parties in brazil relating to amounts owed these third parties by certain of our customers

secured advances to farmers and suppliers and prepaid commodity contracts 
we purchase soybeans through prepaid commodity purchase contracts advance cash payments to suppliers against contractual obligations to deliver specified quantities of soybeans in the future and secured advances to suppliers loans to suppliers against contractual commitments to deliver soybeans in the future  primarily in brazil 
these financing arrangements are typically secured by the farmer s future crop and mortgages on the farmer s land  buildings and equipment  and are generally settled after the farmer s crop is harvested and sold 
we also extend secured advances to our suppliers on a long term basis as producers use these advances to expand planted acreage and to purchase other supplies needed for the production of agricultural commodities 
newly expanded production acreage will generally take two to three years to reach normal yields 
the repayment terms of our non current secured advances to suppliers generally range from two to three years 
this program is intended to assure the future supply

the discount rates approximate the day commercial paper rate plus annual commitment fees ranging from to basis points in 
table of contents during and  the outstanding undivided interests averaged million and million  respectively 
we retain collection and administrative responsibilities for the accounts receivable in the pools 
we recognized million  million and million in related expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively  which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in bunge s consolidated statements of income 
in addition  we retain interests in the pools of accounts receivable not sold 
due to the short term nature of the accounts receivable  our retained interests in the pools are valued at historical cost  which approximates fair value 
the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been retained in our consolidated balance sheets since collections of all pooled accounts receivable are first utilized to reduce the outstanding undivided interests 
accounts receivable at december  and were net of million and million  respectively  representing the outstanding undivided interests in pooled accounts receivable 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations and their expected maturities at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in the future periods indicated 
at december  contractual obligations total less than year years years after years us in millions other short term borrowings variable interest rate obligations long term debt fixed interest rate obligations non cancelable lease obligations freight supply agreements inventory purchase commitments uncertain income tax positions total contractual obligations we also have variable interest rate obligations on certain of our outstanding borrowings 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into purchase commitments for time on ocean freight vessels and freight service on railroad lines for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities 
in addition  we sell time on these ocean freight vessels when excess freight capacity is available 
these agreements range from two months to three years in the case of ocean freight vessels and to years in the case of railroad services 
actual amounts paid under these contracts may differ due to the variable components of these agreements and the amount of income earned by us on the sale of excess capacity 
the railroad freight services agreements require a minimum monthly payment regardless of the actual level of freight services used by us 
the costs of our freight supply agreements are typically passed through to our customers as a component of the prices we charge for our products 
however  changes in the market value of freight compared to the rates at which we have contracted for freight may affect margins on the sales of agricultural commodities 
represents estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents also in the ordinary course of business  we enter into relet agreements related to ocean freight vessels 
such relet agreements are similar to sub leases 
payments to be received by us under such relet agreements are approximately million in and million in at december   we had million of contractual commitments related to construction in progress 
employee benefit plans we expect to contribute million to our defined benefit pension plans and million to our post retirement healthcare benefit plans in critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part iii of this annual report on form k 
allowances for uncollectible accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers and record allowances for uncollectible accounts if we have determined that collection is doubtful 
we base our determination of the allowance for uncollectible accounts on historical experience  market conditions  current trends and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
different assumptions  changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of our customers could result in additional provisions to the allowance for uncollectible accounts and an increase in bad debt expense 
at december   our allowances for uncollectible current and non current trade accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers were million and million  respectively 
at december   our allowances for uncollectible current and non current trade accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers were million and million  respectively 
we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and will adjust these reserves in the future depending upon significant changes in circumstances 
recoverable taxes we evaluate the collectibility of our recoverable taxes and record valuation allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful 
recoverable taxes primarily represent value added taxes paid on the acquisition of raw materials and other services which can be recovered in cash or as compensation of outstanding balances against income taxes or certain other taxes we may owe 
management s assumption about the collectibility of recoverable taxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the applicable federal or local government to refund the taxes 
the balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories  purchases of new inventories  seasonality  changes in applicable tax rates  cash payment by the applicable government agencies and compensation of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the applicable governments 
at december  and  the allowance for recoverable taxes was million and million  respectively 
we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and will adjust these reserves in the future depending upon significant changes in circumstances 

table of contents inventories and derivatives to the extent we consider it prudent for minimizing risk  we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with agricultural commodity prices  energy and ocean freight costs  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we are exposed to loss in the event of non performance by the counterparties to these contracts 
the risk of non performance is routinely monitored and adjustments recorded  if necessary  to account for potential non performance 
different assumptions  changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of the counterparties to these derivative instruments could result in additional fair value adjustments and increased expense reflected in cost of goods sold  foreign exchange or interest expense 
at december   we recorded allowances of million for current mark to market values of open positions and over the counter transactions related to non performance by specific customers  of which million was recorded in cost of goods sold and million is recorded as bad debt expense in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we did not have significant allowances relating to non performance by counterparties at december  our readily marketable commodity inventories  forward purchase and sale contracts  and exchange traded futures and options are valued at fair value 
these inventories are freely traded  have quoted market prices and may be sold without significant additional processing 
we estimate fair values based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets 
changes in the fair values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of goods sold 
if we used different methods or factors to estimate fair values  amounts reported as inventories and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in the consolidated balance sheets and cost of goods sold could differ 
additionally  if market conditions change subsequent to year end  amounts reported in future periods as inventories  unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and cost of goods sold could differ 
property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of property  plant and equipment assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets 
if it appears that the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against results of operations 
our judgments related to the expected useful lives of property  plant and equipment assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our property  plant and equipment assets  changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges 
in  we recorded pretax impairment charges of million and million in our agribusiness and edible oil products segments  respectively  relating to write downs of a smaller  older and less efficient oilseed processing  refining and packaging facility in europe and a smaller  older and less efficient oilseed processing facility in the united states 
declining results of operations at these facilities  which resulted from adverse operating conditions led management to permanently close these facilities 
in  we recorded pretax impairment charges of million  million  and million in our agribusiness  edible oil products and milling products segments  respectively  relating to write downs of smaller  older and less efficient facilities 
these included four oilseed processing  refining and packaging facilities in europe  an oilseed processing facility and an edible oil products packaging facility in the united states  one wheat milling facility in brazil and one corn milling facility in canada 
the declining results of operations of these facilities  as well as our additions of new  larger and better located 
table of contents facilities in recent years  led management to reach a decision to permanently close all or substantial portions of these facilities 
in addition to the facility impairments  pretax impairment charges included million impairments related to certain brands and other intangible assets in india as a result of declining returns on those assets 
in  we recorded pretax impairment charges of million and million in our agribusiness and edible oil products segments  respectively  relating to write downs of three smaller  older and less efficient oilseed processing  refining and packaging facilities  in brazil 
declining results of operations at these facilities  which resulted from adverse operating conditions in the brazilian agribusiness industry  competition from argentina and the strength of the brazilian currency  led management to permanently close these three facilities 
investments in affiliates we continually review our equity investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time that the fair value of the investment is less than our carrying value  the financial condition  operating performance and near term prospects of the investment  which include general market conditions specific to the investment or the industry in which it operates  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery in fair value 
we did not have any significant impairment charges relating to our equity investments in  and goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the costs of businesses acquired over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually 
in assessing the recovery of goodwill  projections regarding estimated discounted future cash flows  market place data and other factors are used to determine the fair value of the reporting units and the respective assets 
our reporting units  which are our operating segments  in which we have recorded goodwill  are agribusiness  edible oil products and milling products 
these projections are based on historical data  anticipated market conditions and management plans 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test and as a result  there was no impairment of goodwill recognized 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test and recognized a million impairment of goodwill related to our packaged oil brands in europe and asia in the edible oils product segment 
the impairments were a result of a decline in the market conditions in asia and our continued business realignment in europe 
contingencies we are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits  primarily tax and labor claims in brazil  arising in the normal course of business  and have accrued our estimate of the probable costs to resolve these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel and is based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
for more information on tax and labor claims in brazil  please see item legal proceedings 

table of contents employee benefit plans we sponsor various us and foreign pension and post retirement benefit plans 
in connection with the plans  we make various assumptions in the determination of projected benefit obligations and expense recognition related to pension and post retirement obligations 
key assumptions include discount rates  rates of return on plan assets  asset allocations and rates of future compensation increases 
management develops its assumptions based on its experience and by reference to market related data 
all assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate on primarily the us and brazilian petros defined benefit pension plans would increase annual expense and the projected benefit obligation by million and million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the long term return assumptions on our defined benefit pension plan assets would increase or decrease annual pension expense by million 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize 
we consider projections of future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the size of the valuation allowances 
if we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount  we decrease the valuation allowance  thereby increasing net income 
conversely  if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset  we increase the valuation allowance  thereby decreasing net income 
prior to recording a valuation allowance  our deferred tax assets were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
however  we have recorded valuation allowances of million and million at december  and  respectively  primarily representing the uncertainty regarding the recoverability of certain net operating loss carryforwards 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
we apply a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de recognition of tax benefits 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not additional taxes will be due 
we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determined the liabilities are no longer necessary 
at december  and  we had recorded tax liabilities of million and million  respectively  in our consolidated balance sheet

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management as a result of our global operating and financing activities  we are exposed to changes in agricultural commodity prices  transportation costs  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy costs which may affect our results of operations and financial position 
we actively monitor and manage these various market risks associated with our business activities 
we have a centralized risk management group  headed by our chief risk officer  which oversees management of our risk exposures globally 
additionally  our board of directors finance and risk policy committee supervises  reviews and periodically revises our overall risk management policies and limits 
we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with commodity prices  transportation costs  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy costs and for positioning our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we enter into derivative instruments primarily with major financial institutions  commodity exchanges in the case of commodity futures and options  or shipping companies 
table of contents in the case of ocean freight 
while these derivative instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  those fluctuations are generally offset by the changes in fair value of the underlying exposures 
the derivative instruments are intended to minimize the volatility on operating profits  however  they can occasionally result in earnings volatility  which may be material 
credit and counterparty risk through our normal business activities  we are subject to significant credit and counterparty risks that arise through normal commercial sales and purchases  including forward commitments to buy or sell  and through various other over the counter derivative instruments that we utilize to manage risks inherent in our business activities 
we define credit and counterparty risk as a potential financial loss due to the failure of a counterparty to honor its obligations 
the exposure is measured based upon several factors  including unpaid accounts receivable from counterparties and unrealized gains from over the counter derivative instruments including forward purchase and sale contracts 
we actively monitor credit and counterparty risk through credit analysis and review by various committees and task forces which monitor counterparty performance  particularly during periods of extreme price movement or volatility 
we record provisions for counterparty losses from time to time as a result of our credit and counterparty analysis 
because of the recent severe tightening of credit markets and general deterioration in the global economy  credit and counterparty risks are heightened 
this increased risk is being monitored through  among other things  increased communications with key counterparties  management reviews and specific focus on counterparties or groups of counterparties that we may determine as high risk 
in addition  we have limited new credit extensions in certain cases and have expanded our use of exchange cleared derivative instruments where possible 
commodities risk we operate in many areas of the food industry  from agricultural raw materials to the production and sale of branded food products 
as a result  we purchase and produce various materials  many of which are agricultural commodities  including soybeans  soybean oil  soybean meal  sunflower seed  rapeseed or canola  wheat  corn and sugar 
agricultural commodities are subject to price fluctuations due to a number of unpredictable factors that may create price risk 
we are also subject to the risk of counterparty non performance under forward purchase or sale contracts and experienced some isolated instances of counterparty non performance late in as a result of steep commodity price declines  particularly relative to committed prices for forward sales contracted earlier in the year at higher price levels 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded counterparty risk adjustments of approximately million  of which million related to counterparty non performance 
the adjustments were a result of a combination of the depressed global economy and the adverse impact of significant declines in agricultural commodity  freight and energy prices on certain customers and other counterparties 
we enter into various derivative contracts with the primary objective of managing our exposure to adverse price movements in the agricultural commodities used for our business operations 
we have established policies that limit the amount of unhedged fixed price agricultural commodity positions permissible for our operating companies  which are a combination of position and value at risk var limits 
we measure and review our net commodities position on a daily basis 
our daily net agricultural commodity position consists of inventory  forward purchase and sale contracts  over the counter and exchange traded derivative instruments  including those used to hedge portions of our production requirements 
the fair value of that position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each agricultural commodity by valuing all of our commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period where available or utilizing a close proxy 
var is calculated on the net position and monitored at the and confidence intervals 
in addition  scenario analysis is performed on the portfolio 
for example  one measure of market risk is estimated as the potential loss 
table of contents in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  are as follows year ended december  year ended december  us in millions fair value market risk fair value market risk highest long position highest short position ocean freight risk ocean freight represents a significant portion of our operating costs 
the market price for ocean freight varies depending on the supply and demand for ocean vessels  global economic conditions and other factors 
we enter into time charter agreements for time on ocean freight vessels based on forecasted requirements for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities 
our time charter agreements have terms ranging from two months to five years 
we use financial derivatives  known as freight forward agreements  to hedge portions of our ocean freight costs 
the ocean freight derivatives are included in other current assets and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
a portion of the ocean freight derivatives have been designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 of our firm commitments to purchase time on ocean freight vessels 
changes in the fair value of the ocean freight derivatives that are qualified  designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge  along with the gain or loss on the hedged firm commitments to purchase time on ocean freight vessels that is attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in earnings 
for the year ended december   we recognized in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income million of losses on the firm commitments to purchase time on ocean freight vessels  which were offset by million of gains on freight derivative contracts 
there was no material gain or loss recognized in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  due to hedge ineffectiveness 
in october a portion of the fair market value hedges of firm commitments to purchase time on ocean freight vessels were de designated 
we expect to recognize in and gains of million and million  respectively  in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income related to the amortization of amounts recorded in current and non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december  steep declines in ocean freight rates during the third quarter of  resulting largely from new shipping vessels put into use  the recent global economic slowdown and related tightening of credit markets and the impact on global demand for vessels from industries relying upon ocean freight  such as the steel industry  have put pressure on our ocean freight counterparties 
our counterparties with respect to ocean freight derivative instruments are generally owner operators of ocean vessels or their affiliates  and are often also our counterparties on time or voyage charter agreements 
as a result of the adverse conditions in the ocean freight industry described above  we experienced some counterparty defaults on settlements that came due in and also made significant adjustments for nonperformance by freight industry counterparties as part of our valuation of freight related derivative instruments in the fourth quarter of we are continuing to actively monitor these counterparties and their expected ability to settle on freight derivatives as payments come due 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview 
in  we entered into an agreement to relet a portion of our long term time charter portfolio and also entered into certain associated freight forward agreements with a third party 
we expect to recognize a gain on this transaction over the term of the agreement  which expires in deferred gains are included in other current and non current liabilities as of december  
table of contents energy risk we purchase various energy commodities such as bunker fuel  electricity and natural gas that are used to operate our manufacturing facilities and ocean freight vessels 
the energy commodities are subject to price risk 
we use financial derivatives  including exchange traded and otc swaps and options  with the primary objective of hedging portions of our energy exposure 
these energy derivatives are included in other current assets and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
currency risk our global operations require active participation in foreign exchange markets 
to reduce the risk arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations  we follow a policy of hedging monetary assets and liabilities and commercial transactions with foreign currency exposure 
our primary exposure is related to our subsidiaries located in brazil and europe and to a lesser extent  argentina  canada and asia 
we enter into derivative instruments  such as forward contracts and swaps  and to a lesser extent  foreign currency options  to limit exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to our recorded foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and our local currency operating expenses 
we may also hedge other foreign currency exposures as deemed appropriate 
when determining our exposure  we exclude intercompany loans that are deemed to be permanently invested 
the repayments of permanently invested intercompany loans are not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future and therefore are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  the foreign exchange gains and losses on these borrowings are excluded from the determination of net income and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
the balance of permanently invested intercompany borrowings was  million as of december  and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are foreign exchange losses of million for the year ended december  and million foreign exchange gains for the year ended december   related to permanently invested intercompany loans 
for risk management purposes and to determine the overall level of hedging required  we further reduce the foreign exchange exposure determined above by the value of our agricultural commodities inventories 
our agricultural commodities inventories  because of their international pricing in us dollars  provide a natural offset to our currency exposure 
our net currency positions  including currency derivatives  and our market risk  which is measured in the following table as the potential loss from an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we have provided an analysis of our foreign currency exposure after reducing the exposure for our agricultural commodities inventories

foreign exchange derivatives certain of our operations are subject to risk from exchange rate fluctuations in connection with anticipated sales in foreign currencies 
to minimize this risk  in and  a combination of foreign exchange contracts and zero cost collars were purchased and designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
as of december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of anticipated foreign currency denominated sales have been hedged with the underlying derivative contracts settling at various dates through december at december  and  the fair value of contracts expected to settle within the next months  which was recorded in other current liabilities and other current assets  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the changes in the fair values on the component of the contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and were approximately million and million  respectively  net of tax  in the years ended december  and the changes in the fair values are reclassified into earnings when the anticipated sales occur with approximately million  net of tax loss expected to be reclassified into earnings in the ineffective portion of these hedges was million at december  and was recorded as foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of income for bunge assesses  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flow hedged items 
we use net investment hedges to mitigate the translation adjustments arising from remeasuring our investment in certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges  we record the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
during  we entered into fixed interest rate currency swaps with a notional value of million to hedge the net asset exposure in our brazilian subsidiaries 
under the terms of these swaps  we pay brazilian interest rates and receive fixed us dollar interest rates 
the exchange of principal at the maturity of the swap is expected to offset the foreign exchange translation adjustment of our net investment in our brazilian real functional currency subsidiaries 
these swaps mature in december at december   the fair value of the fixed interest rate currency swaps was a loss of million  which was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheet as an offset to the foreign currency translation gain from the underlying brazilian real net asset exposure 
in october  we de designated cross currency swaps with a notional value of million that hedged our net investment in brazilian assets 
the fair value of these swaps was zero at the 
table of contents de designation date 
between october and december  when such swaps matured  we recorded a gain of million in earnings related to the change in fair value of these cross currency swaps 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million gain as an offset against foreign exchange translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income loss that related to the change in the fair value of the outstanding net investment hedges 
interest rate risk we have debt in fixed and floating rate instruments 
we are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure related to our debt portfolio 
the aggregate fair value of our short and long term debt  based on market yields at december   was  million with a carrying value of  million 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the interest yields on our debt at december  would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of our debt 
similarly  a decrease of basis points in the interest yields on our debt at december  would cause an increase of approximately million in the fair value of our debt 
a hypothetical change in libor would result in a change of approximately million in our interest expense 
some of our variable rate debt is denominated in currencies other than in us dollars and is indexed to non us dollar based interest rate indices  such as euribor and tjlp 
as such  the hypothetical change in interest rate ignores the impact from any currency movements 
interest rate derivatives the interest rate swaps used by us as hedging instruments have been recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded currently in earnings 
additionally  the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value due to changes in benchmark interest rates 
ineffectiveness  as defined in sfas no 
 is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset 
in  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of million maturing in for the purpose of managing our interest rate exposure associated with its million three year fixed rate term loan due under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements  we make payments based on the average daily effective federal funds rate and receive payments based on a fixed interest rate 
we have accounted for the interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
the swap agreements are assumed to be perfectly effective under the shortcut method of sfas no 
the interest rate differential  which settles semi annually  is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense

in  we entered into interest rate basis swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of million for the purpose of swapping out of the libor benchmark rate on million of the million three year libor rate term loans due under the terms of the basis swap agreements  we make payments based on the average daily effective federal funds rate and receive payments based on libor 
the basis swap agreements are intended to mitigate our exposure to libor rate settings that have recently risen sharply from benchmark interest rate levels 
these basis swap agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 and therefore we have not designated these swap agreements as hedge instruments 
as a result  changes in fair value of the basis swap agreements are recorded as an adjustment to earnings

in addition  in  and  we recognized approximately million million and million  respectively  as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income  related to the amortization of deferred gains on termination of interest rate swap gains 
in  and  we reclassified approximately a million loss in each year from accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets to interest expense in the consolidated statements of income  which related to a settlement of certain derivative contracts recorded as cash flow hedges  in connection with forecasted issuances of debt financing 
we expect to reclassify approximately million to interest expense in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements
