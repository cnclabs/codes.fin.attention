item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general heritage financial group is the parent holding company of heritagebank of the south 
the company is in a mutual holding company structure and of its outstanding common stock is owned by heritage  mhc  a federal mutual holding company 
the principal business of the company is operating our wholly owned subsidiary  the bank 
our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans and investment and mortgage backed securities  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  consisting of savings and checking accounts  money market accounts  time deposits  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings 
our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses  noninterest income and noninterest expense 
noninterest income consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage origination fees  transaction fees  bank owned life insurance  and commissions from investment services 
noninterest expense consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  equipment and data processing  advertising  professional fees and other costs 
our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  changes in market interest rates  governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
evolution of business strategy we originally were chartered as a federal credit union in in  we became a community chartered credit union 
we accepted deposits and made loans to members who lived  worked or worshiped in the approved counties for the credit union charter 
in  we converted to a mutual thrift charter in order to better serve our customers and communities through a broader lending ability and an expanded customer base beyond the field of membership permitted for our credit union 
the mutual holding company structure was established in  and we converted from a thrift charter to a state savings bank charter in we feel this structure best suits our continued efforts to grow and expand our commercial business 
the company completed an initial public stock offering stock offering on june  it sold  shares of common stock in that offering for per share 
the company s employee stock ownership plan the esop purchased  shares with the proceeds of a loan from the company 
the company received net proceeds of million in the public offering  of which was contributed to the bank and million of which was loaned to the esop for its purchase of shares in the offering 
the company also issued an additional  shares of common stock to mhc  so that mhc would own of the outstanding common stock at the closing of the offering 
our current business strategy is to operate a well capitalized and profitable commercial and retail financial institution dedicated to serving the needs of our customers 
we strive to be the primary financial institution in the market areas we serve 
we offer a broad range of products and services while stressing personalized and efficient customer service and convenient access to these products and services 
we intend to continue to operate as a commercial and consumer lender 
we have structured operations around a branch system that is staffed with knowledgeable and well trained employees 
subject to capital requirements and our ability to grow in a reasonable and prudent manner  we may open additional branches as opportunities arise 
in addition to our branch system  we continue to expand electronic services for our customers 
we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing a higher level of customer service 

table of contents our core business is composed of the following commercial banking and small business lending we focus on the commercial real estate and business needs of individuals and small to medium sized businesses in our market area 
in addition  we focus on high net worth individuals and small business owners 
the commercial banking department is composed of seasoned commercial lenders and a support staff with years of combined experience in the industry 
we expect this department to continue to be the fastest growing component of our business 
indirect auto lending we provide automobile loans to customers through long standing relationships with a number of automobile dealerships throughout southern georgia 
while indirect lending is highly competitive  our ability to provide same day funding makes our product attractive 
retail banking we operate a network of six branch offices located in dougherty  lee and worth counties and two branches located in ocala  florida 
each office is staffed with knowledgeable banking professionals who strive to deliver quality service 
brokerage investment services we offer investment products  life  health  disability and long term care insurance through our brokerage department 
our licensed personnel have over years of experience in the financial services industry 
mortgage lending staffed with experienced mortgage originators and processors  our mortgage lending department originates residential mortgage loans that are primarily funded by third party mortgage lenders 
we collect a fee on the origination of these loans 
we continue to implement this business strategy 
a critical component of this strategy includes increasing our non consumer based lending 
during  our farmland  construction  commercial real estate  nonresidential  business and multifamily loans increased slightly from million or of the total loan portfolio to million or of the total loan portfolio 
our ability to continue to grow our commercial loan portfolio is an important element of our long term business strategy 
these non consumer based loans are considered to entail greater risks than one to four family residential loans 
another key component of our business strategy is the expansion of our operations beyond the southwest georgia market 
on august   we commenced operating a branch in ocala  florida 
as of december   we had approximately million in loans and million in deposits generated in our north central florida market 
operating a branch outside of the southwest georgia market subjects us to additional risk factors 
these risk factors include  but are not limited to the following management of employees from a distance  lack of knowledge of the local market  additional credit risks  logistical operational issues  and time constraints of management 
these risk factors  as well as others we have not specifically identified  may affect our ability to successfully operate outside of our current market area 
asset and liability management and market risk our risk when interest rates change 
the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market rates change over time 
like other financial institutions  our results of operations are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
how we measure our risk of interest rate changes 
as part of our attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor our interest rate risk 
in doing so  we analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their interest rates and payment streams  timing of maturities  repricing opportunities  and sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 

table of contents to manage the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases in interest rates on our results of operations  we adopted asset and liability management policies to understand  measure  monitor  and control the risk 
these policies are designed to allow us to implement strategies to minimize the effects of interest rate changes to net income and capital position by properly matching the maturities and repricing terms of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these policies are implemented by the risk management committee  which is composed of senior management and board members 
the risk management committee establishes guidelines for and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources  taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity requirements 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that limit negative changes in net income and capital while supporting liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
senior managers oversee the process on a daily basis 
the risk management committee meets quarterly to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected needs and capital position  anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  interest rate risk exposure  liquidity position and net portfolio present value 
the committee also recommends strategy changes  as appropriate  based on their review 
the committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
in order to manage our assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  we have focused our strategies on limiting the percentage of long term fixed rate loans within our portfolio  originating a mix of variable rate and shorter term fixed rate loans  originating prime based home equity lines of credit  managing deposit relationships for stability and a lower cost of funds position  using federal home loan bank advances and other funding sources to align maturities and repricing terms of funding sources with loans  and continuing the origination of consumer loans 
the risk management committee has oversight over the asset liability management of the company 
this committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net income and the market value of portfolio equity 
market value of portfolio equity is a measurement of the value of the balance sheet at a fixed point in time 
it is summarized as the fair value of assets less the fair value of liabilities 
the committee reviews computations of the value of capital at current interest rates and alternative interest rates 
the variance in the net portfolio value between current interest rate computations and alternative rate computations represents the potential impact on capital if rates were to change 

table of contents comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets increased million  a increase from december   to million at december  the increase was due primarily to growth in cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and investments  funded by growth in deposits and borrowings 
total interest earning assets increased million or to million at december   from million at december  gross loans decreased million or to million at december   compared with million at december  investment securities increased million or to million at december  federal funds purchased increased million or to million at december  interest bearing deposits in banks increased  or to  at december  the increase in these liquid interest earning assets was due primarily to our intent to maintain higher than historical levels of liquidity 
this was done due to the amount of panic that existed in the financial markets during the third and fourth quarters of due to this level of uncertainty  we sought to be able to meet any demands from our customers that may arise  primarily to be able to facilitate large deposit withdrawals if necessary 
this strategy does cause net interest margin to decrease  however  we feel the benefits of maintaining excess liquidity during uncertain economic times outweighs the cost to net interest margin 
we expect to continue to maintain excess liquidity during the decrease in loans is due to a lack of demand we have seen from our customers and from an increase in loans transferred to other real estate owned 
as the economic slowdown continues  we expect to continue to see loan demand decrease 
we expect to see our loan portfolio continue to decrease due to normal amortizations and paydowns 
particularly  we expect our indirect automobile portfolio to decrease approximately million during as we continue to see extremely weak demand for automobile sales 
other equity securities increased to million at december  this is due to our investment in chattahoochee bank of georgia chattahoochee 
cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance boli increased by million  primarily due to the purchase of million of additional boli in june of this purchase was made due to an advantageous interest rate environment compared to other investment alternatives 
in addition  this purchase allowed us to cover many new officers of the bank that were not covered under existing boli policies which were purchased in foreclosed assets increased million to million at december  million of the foreclosed assets is a residential development in the florida panhandle 
this loan was a participation purchased by the bank s commercial lending division in albany 
this development consisted of completed homes and lots 
as of december   we have sold of the homes and one of the lots 
in  we sold the remainder of these homes for their approximate net book value as of december  another  of the balance in foreclosed assets is a residential development in northeast georgia 
this loan was a participation purchased by the bank s commercial lending division in albany 
the development is an unfinished subdivision  and the value is based on a current appraisal 
we are currently in the process of seeking a buyer for this development 
this loan was not purchased from  originated by  or related to our investment in  chattahoochee bank of georgia 
the remainder of the balance in foreclosed assets represents various pieces of real estate  with no single piece exceeding  and repossessed automobiles totaling  total liabilities increased million or to million at december   compared with million at december  this increase was due primarily to the increase in interest bearing liabilities  which increased million or  to million at december   from million at december  deposits ended the year at million  up or million from million from december  this increase was attributable to our geographic expansion efforts  as well as a focus on attracting core deposits 
as part of this effort  we decreased brokered deposits during by million 
total borrowings amounted to million at december   an increase of million or from december  in addition  we increased federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements by million or  of which million is in federal funds purchased from chattahoochee bank of georgia 
these purchases are done as an accommodation to chattahoochee so that they can earn a competitive rate on federal funds without having to place concentrated amounts of federal funds with traditional correspondent banks 
in return  these funds provide us with a stable  low cost source of funds 
the remaining million of the increase is in repurchase agreements  which were entered into to provide us with a source of low cost floating rate funds 
total equity decreased million or to million at december  a net loss of  dividends of  and the purchase of million of treasury stock decreased equity 
compensation expense related to the allocation of esop shares of  stock based compensation expense of  and other comprehensive income of  partially offset the decrease in equity 

table of contents during  we purchased a significant amount of treasury stock 
because of the recent decrease in the overall market value of financial institutions  we believe there has been opportunity to repurchase our stock below its inherent value 
we will continue to look at opportunities to repurchase stock at values we believe are below the inherent value of the company  while also considering other capital and liquidity needs as well as other investment alternatives 
average balances  net interest income  yields earned and rates paid the following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates

it distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and that due to the changes in interest rates 
the change in interest attributable to rate has been determined by applying the change in rate between years to average balances outstanding in the later year 
the change in interest due to volume has been determined by applying the rate from the earlier year to the change in average balances outstanding between years

table of contents comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general our net income decreased by million or to a loss of  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  basic and diluted net income per share decreased or per share to a loss of per share for december   compared with net income of per share at december  impairment losses on securities of million and a million increase in provision for loans losses were the primary reasons for the decrease in earnings 
further explanations of these changes are discussed in more detail in the following sections 
net interest income net interest income increased  or to million compared with million for the twelve months ending our net interest spread decreased basis points to compared with during the year earlier period 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to versus during the same period in average interest earning assets increased million or to million compared with million during the year earlier period 
average interest bearing liabilities increased million or to million compared with million at december  the federal reserve board has made extreme moves in interest rates  dropping the federal funds rate from a high of in mid down to its current level of a targeted range of zero to 
these decreases in the federal funds rate have caused our net interest margin to decline 
in addition to the pressure these decreases have put on our margin  we have also seen pressure from historically high spreads between us treasury rates and bank certificate of deposit rates 
as many banks have had to aggressively go after deposit customers  we have had to keep our rates higher than normal during such dramatic drops in interest rates 
in addition  the federal reserve has taken measures to keep longer term interest rates down by buying us treasury bonds 
this has an additional effect of keeping the yield curve relatively flat  which puts additional strain on our ability to improve the net interest margin 
as long as these trends continue  we expect to see the net interest margin decrease during additionally  as our loan demand remains weak  we will likely see a decrease in interest earning assets  which could cause our net interest income to decrease 
provision for loan losses we recorded a provision for loans losses of million in compared with million for the prior year period 
net charge offs of million added to the increase in reserve requirement for non performing loans increased million to million at december   compared with million at december  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans increased to compared with at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased by basis points to compared with at december  the bulk of our non performing loans consist of a million loan on raw land in atlanta  georgia 
we are currently working with the borrower to dispose of this property 
it was originally purchased for commercial and residential development 
however  due to the economic environment in the area  we no longer believe this is a viable alternative 
the next largest non performing loan is a real estate loan for  secured by a restaurant building in ocala  florida 
the remainder of our non performing loans consist of various consumer and commercial loans  none exceeding  current appraisals on real estate loans  expected costs of potential foreclosure or other disposition  and other potential losses on these loans are considered in our analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
loans past due or more days and still accruing totaled million  or of total loans at december  this compares to million at december   or of loans 
we had no loans past due or more days and still accruing at december  or our internally criticized and classified assets totaled million at december   compared to million at december  these balances include the aforementioned nonperforming loans  other real estate  and repossessed assets 
our internal loan review processes strive to identify weaknesses in loans prior to performance issues 
however  our processes do not always provide sufficient time to work out plans with borrowers that would avoid foreclosure and or losses 
we continue to see weakness in our loan portfolio  and as economic conditions remain difficult  we expect this trend to continue until we see improvement in the overall economy 
we have taken actions to prevent losses in our current portfolio  including a weekly meeting of members of management and lenders to discuss the status and action plan on each problem loan 
we have also taken steps to better evaluate the capital and liquidity positions of our commercial loan guarantors  particularly those involved in commercial real estate construction and development 

table of contents we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  at a level we believe will reflect probable credit losses based on historical loss trends and an evaluation of specific credits in the loan portfolio 
in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses  we consider the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions  and past due status and trends 
we assess the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and make provisions for loan losses as necessary in order to maintain the proper level of allowance 
while we use available information to recognize losses on loans  future loan loss provisions may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize additional provisions based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio  and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable 
the level of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from the estimates 
impairment losses on securities during  we determined that the securities of three issuers whose securities were held in our available for sale portfolio were other than temporarily impaired 
the total impairment charge recorded was million 
the securities included a million investment in the preferred stock of freddie mac  which we impaired completely subsequent to the government intervention into the entity 
in addition  we impaired the corporate bonds of general motors  in which we had an investment of million that was written down to  and the corporate bonds of ford motor credit  in which we held an investment of million that was written down to  subsequent to these impairments  we saw a significant increase in the value of our corporate bonds 
based on this change in value  we sold our investments in general motors and ford motor credit for an approximate  gain from their previously impaired values 
we currently still hold our investment in the preferred stock of freddie mac 
as of december   approximately of our investment portfolio had a rating of investment grade  with of the portfolio having a rating of aaa 
approximately of our investment portfolio is not rated by the major credit rating agencies 
noninterest income a summary of noninterest income  excluding securities transactions  follows for the years ended  chg chg dollars in thousands service charges on deposit accounts other service charges  commissions and fees brokerage fees mortgage origination fees bank owned life insurance other total noninterest income noninterest income as a percentage of average assets our service charges on deposit accounts remained relatively flat 
in previous years we have seen significant increases in our overdraft protection products  however  as this product has matured  our increases have become modest 
we expect service charges to remain flat  or decrease slightly if economic activity continues to remain slow 

table of contents the increase in other service charges  commissions and fees was due primarily to an increase in debit and atm transaction fees 
our customers continue to increase debit card usage instead of using cash or checks 
we expect this trend to continue  despite a decrease in consumer spending 
the increase in our brokerage fees was due primarily to an increase in assets under management 
however  recent declines in the stock market could cause this income to decrease in the future 
mortgage fees increased despite a slow down in the real estate market 
we have had increased refinancing activity as rates have decreased  which has more than offset the decline from a slower real estate market 
despite the increase in refinancing activity  stricter underwriting standards have caused an increase in the amount of time it takes to process each loan  which could cause a decrease in revenue 
earnings on bank owned life insurance policies increased due to the purchase of an additional million of cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance policies in other noninterest income increased due to an increase in miscellaneous service charges that took place late in the increase was offset by decreases in fhlb stock dividends of  to  for we do not expect to receive any fhlb stock dividends in 
table of contents noninterest expense a summary of noninterest expense follows for the years ended december  chg chg dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits equipment occupancy advertising and marketing legal and accounting directors fees and retirement consulting and other professional fees telecommunications supplies data processing fees loss on sale and write downs of other real estate owned nm foreclosed asset expenses fdic insurance and other regulatory fees other operating total noninterest expenses noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets the decrease in salaries and employee benefits is due a decrease of million of expenses related to executive benefit plans that were fully vested in we expect salaries and benefits to remain level in equipment and occupancy expenses increased primarily because of the opening of two new branches in ocala in january and june of we expect these expenses to remain level in as increased branch expenses are offset by other cost reduction measures 
advertising and marketing increased due to our increased business development expenses in the ocala market 
the increase in legal and accounting fees was due to a significant increase in legal fees  while audit fees decreased slightly 
the increase in legal fees were related to our investment in chattahoochee bank of georgia  and legal expenses related to collection efforts on problem assets 
the decrease in directors fees is due to a decrease of  of expenses related to director retirement plans that were fully vested in in addition  incentive pay for advisory directors was not earned in as business development goals were not attained 
consulting and other professional fees decreased primarily due to the payment of  to one vendor for an organizational restructuring  expense reduction and revenue enhancement project in telecommunication expenses were up slightly due to the addition of two new branches in supply expenses were down due to our efforts to reduce expenses and renegotiation of vendor contracts 
data processing expenses increased due to the increased amount of debit card transactions in the loss on sale and write down of other real estate owned increased due to the increased amount of other real estate owned and efforts to dispose of these properties 
we expect that these expenses will remain elevated until levels of other real estate owned are reduced 

table of contents foreclosed asset expenses also increased significantly due to the increased level of foreclosed assets 
we expect that these expenses will also remain elevated until levels of other real estate and repossessions are reduced 
the increase in fdic insurance and other regulatory fees was due to an increase in fdic premiums and the utilization of our remaining prior credits toward these premiums in for  we are expecting the base premium to increase approximately from the level 
in addition  the recent announcement of a proposed special one time assessment from the fdic will add an additional  to  to the already increased premium for  depending on the final assessment from the fdic 
in addition  there are other provisions in the most recent fdic board decision which will allow other special assessments to be imposed 
at this time  we are not certain of the magnitude of these proposed assessments if they were to be imposed 
the increase in other operating expenses was due primarily to increases in travel and training that occurred early in we expect this to decrease as travel and training budgets have been reduced for income tax expense income tax benefits were  greater during the year ended december as compared with the majority of the income tax benefits in primarily related to the reversal of a contingent income tax liability of million 
the contingent liability had been established in upon converting to a taxable entity and reflected the potential tax impact of tax positions taken at that time 
we believed the filing position was supportable based upon a reasonable interpretation of federal income tax laws and the underlying regulations  however  due to the lack of prior rulings on similar fact patterns  it was unknown whether the tax position would be sustained upon audit by either federal or state tax authorities 
the applicable statue of limitations expired on september   making the contingency reserve unnecessary 
we have no other contingent reserves for uncertain tax positions as of december  due to the unusual nature of the items in the and years  a comparison of effective tax rates is not meaningful 
liquidity and capital resources we are required to have enough cash and investments that qualify as liquid assets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation 
liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans 
historically  we have maintained liquid assets above levels believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations  including potential deposit outflows 
cash flow projections are regularly reviewed and updated to assure that adequate liquidity is maintained 
our liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
the company has million in cash  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in banks generally available for its cash needs 
the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments and funds provided by operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and maturing short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
in addition  the bank invests excess funds in short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
the bank also generates cash through borrowings  primarily from federal home loan bank advances  to leverage its capital base  provide funds for its lending and investment activities and enhance its interest rate risk management 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally invested in short term investments  such as overnight deposits and federal funds 
on a longer term basis  we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products and investment securities  including mortgage backed securities 
the bank uses its sources of funds primarily to meet its ongoing commitments  pay maturing deposits  fund withdrawals and fund loan commitments 
at december   the total approved loan commitments and unused lines of credit outstanding amounted to million  and outstanding letters of credit were million 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at december   totaled million 
it is management s policy to manage deposit rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions 
based on this management strategy  we believe that a majority of maturing deposits will remain with the bank 
in addition  the bank had the ability  at december   to borrow an additional million from the federal home loan bank of atlanta and million from another lender as a funding source to meet commitments and for liquidity purposes 

table of contents the consolidated statement of cash flows for the twelve months ended december  and  details cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities 
for the twelve months ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  while investing activities used million  primarily to fund investment growth  and financing activities provided million primarily from an increase in deposits and other borrowings  resulting in a net increase in cash during the twelve month period of million 
in march  we purchased a lot in the southwest georgia market for  for potential future expansion 
we are considering building a branch on this site  and may start construction later in  but have not determined the cost of such an expansion 
off balance sheet liabilities the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
a summary of the company s commitments as of december  is as follows in thousands commitments to extend credit financial stand by letters of credit capital effective january   the company and the bank became subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by the georgia department of banking and finance 
as of that same date  the bank also became subject to minimum capital requirements and capital categories established by the fdic 
based on their capital levels at december   the company and the bank exceeded these state and federal requirements 
consistent with our goals to operate a sound and profitable organization  our policy is for the bank to maintain a well capitalized status under the capital categories of the fdic 
based on capital levels at december   the bank was considered to be well capitalized 
at december   the company had total equity of million or of total assets

table of contents critical accounting policies we have established certain accounting and financial reporting policies to govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from the judgments and estimates adopted by management  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
we believe the following accounting policies applied by us represent critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses in the loan portfolio 
calculation of the allowance for loan losses represents a critical accounting estimate due to the significant judgment  assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses  consideration of current and historical trends and the amount and timing of cash flows related to impaired loans 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents our best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
management evaluates current information and events regarding a borrower s ability to repay its obligations and considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectibility of amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the amount of impairment 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for losses on loans 
subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
cash receipts on impaired loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied first to principal and then to interest income 
income taxes 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in the jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and the provision for loan losses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
after converting to a federally chartered savings association  the bank became a taxable organization 
income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary difference between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  computed using enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance  if needed  reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the internal revenue code and applicable regulations are subject to interpretation with respect to the determination of the tax basis of assets and liabilities for credit unions that convert charters and become a taxable organization 
since the bank s transition to a federally chartered thrift  the bank has recorded income tax expense based upon management s interpretation of the applicable tax regulations 
positions taken by the company in preparing our federal and state tax returns are subject to the review of taxing authorities  and the review of the positions we have taken by taxing authorities could result in adjustments to our financial statements 

table of contents estimates of fair value the estimation of fair value is significant to a number of the company s assets  including  but not limited to  investment securities  goodwill  other real estate owned  and other repossessed assets 
these are all recorded at either fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors 
circumstances that could cause estimates of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities to change include a change in prepayment speeds  discount rates  or market interest rates 
our estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
fair values for most investment securities are based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments 
the fair values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of fair value are also required in performing an impairment analysis of goodwill 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment would be indicated if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed only to us dollar interest rate changes  and  accordingly  the company manages exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
the company does not have any trading instruments nor does it classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
the company monitors its sensitivity to changes in interest rates and may use derivative instruments to hedge this risk 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
finally  the company has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution 
the sensitivity to rate changes is known as interest rate risk 
the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
the company uses simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the simulation of rising  declining and flat interest rate scenarios allows management to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market interest rate swings 
the analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve month period is subjected to a shock in interest rates of  and basis point increase or decrease in market rates on net interest income and is monitored on a quarterly basis 
we also monitor regulatory required interest rate risk analysis which simulates more dramatic changes to rates 
the company s strategy is to mitigate interest risk to the greatest extent possible 
based on our analysis of the company s overall risk to changes in interest rates  we structure investment and funding transactions to reduce this risk 
these strategies aim to achieve neutrality to interest rate risk 
although we strive to have our net interest income neutral to changes in rates  due to the inherent nature of our business  we will never be completely neutral to changes in rates 
as of december   a drop in interest rates would reduce our net interest income and an increase in rates would increase our net interest income 
however  we feel that the level of interest rate risk is at an acceptable level 
the company maintains a risk management committee which monitors and analyzes interest rate risk 
this committee is comprised of members of senior management and outside directors 
this committee meets on a monthly basis and reviews the simulations listed above  as well as other interest rate risk reports 
the following table shows the results of our projections for net interest income expressed as a percentage change over net interest income in a flat rate scenario for an immediate change or shock in market interest rates over a twelve month period
