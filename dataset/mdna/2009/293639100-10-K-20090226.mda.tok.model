item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the largest radio broadcasting companies in the united states  based on revenues 
we operate a nationwide portfolio in excess of radio stations in markets based upon completion of pending acquisitions and dispositions  including san francisco  boston  seattle  denver  sacramento  portland  indianapolis  kansas city  milwaukee  austin  norfolk  buffalo  new orleans  memphis  providence  greensboro  greenville spartanburg  rochester  madison  wichita  wilkes barre scranton  springfield and gainesville ocala 
a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
the revenues are determined by the advertising rates charged and the number of advertisements broadcast 
advertising rates are primarily based on four factors a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured principally by periodic reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  both nationally and in the regions in which the station operates  and the market s size based upon available radio advertising revenue 
in  we generated of our net revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff  and from national advertising  which is sold by independent advertising sales representatives 
local and national revenues include advertising on our websites and the sale of advertising during audio streaming of our radio stations over the internet 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from network compensation  promotional activities and rental income from tower sites 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee compensation  and programming and promotional expenses 
several factors may adversely affect a radio broadcasting company s performance in any given period 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
as opportunities arise  we may  on a selective basis  change or modify a station s format due to changes in listeners tastes or changes in a competitor s format 
this could have an immediate negative impact on a station s ratings and or revenues  and there are no guarantees that the modification or change will be beneficial at some future time 
our management is continually focused on these opportunities as well as the risks and associated uncertainties 
we strive to develop compelling content and strong brand images to maximize audience ratings that are crucial to our stations financial success 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following results of operations include a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our results of operations for the relevant periods represent the operations of the radio stations owned and operated by us  or operated by us pursuant to time brokerage agreements tba  and exclude those owned by us but operated by others pursuant to tbas

table of contents financing our interest expense decreased due to i a decrease in interest rates  and ii the redemption of a portion of our senior subordinated notes the notes that had a higher interest rate than the rate under our senior debt 
this decrease was offset by increased borrowings used to finance a acquisitions during the fourth quarter of in the amount of million  b the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders of million in and million in  and c stock repurchases during of million and during of million  and interest expense of million related to the resolution of certain litigation 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million of senior subordinated notes and recognized a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
on june   we entered into a new credit facility that resulted in the recognition of a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the write off of deferred financing costs during the second quarter of other during the years ended and  we recorded an impairment loss of million and million  respectively  in connection with our review of goodwill and broadcasting licenses under the provisions of sfas no 
please refer to note in the accompanying notes to the financial statements for further discussion of the contributing factors to the impairment loss 
in  our income tax benefit on loss from continuing operations was negatively impacted by an increase to our valuation allowance of million to fully reserve our net deferred tax assets 
the increase was primarily due to the cumulative losses incurred by us since  which caused uncertainty as to the realization of the deferred tax assets in future years 
during  we recovered million from our insurance company for damages resulting from hurricane katrina 
during the first quarter of  we reviewed our carrying amount for the rochester assets then held for sale and determined that an impairment loss of million was necessary as a result of the status of our then ongoing divestiture process 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a discrete income tax expense adjustment of million as we commenced operations in in states which on average have higher income tax rates than in states in which we had previously operated 
net revenues december  december  dollars in millions net revenues amount of change percentage change our decrease in net revenues was primarily due to weak demand for advertising in general that contributed to an overall decline in total market revenues in most of the markets where we operate stations  and the commencement of operations by other parties under tbas on a february  for three of our seven seattle radio stations  b february  for four radio stations in the cincinnati market  and c february  for one radio station in the austin market 
our decrease in net revenues was offset by i the acquisition on november  of four radio stations in the rochester market of which two radio stations were reflected in continuing operations  ii the commencement by us of operations under a tba on february  of three radio stations in the san francisco market  and iii increases in net revenues for our radio stations in markets such as buffalo  madison and milwaukee 

table of contents same station considerations net revenues in were not impacted by any acquisitions or dispositions of radio stations as of the beginning of the period 
net revenues in would have been higher by million if we had adjusted net revenues to give effect to acquisitions or dispositions of radio stations as of the beginning of the period 
station operating expenses december  december  dollars in millions station operating expenses amount of change percentage change the decrease in station operating expenses was primarily due to the factors leading to the decrease in net revenues as described above as certain variable expenses decrease with a corresponding decrease in net revenues  offset by the effects of inflation 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated several cost reduction initiatives  including certain station operating expense and personnel reductions and the cessation of our company s voluntary employee benefits matching programs 
while the impact of these initiatives were not material in this quarter  future periods will benefit from these actions and any further cost reduction actions 
same station considerations station operating expenses in were not impacted by any acquisitions or dispositions of radio stations as of the beginning of the period 
station operating expenses in would have been higher by million if we had adjusted station operating expenses to give effect to acquisitions or dispositions of radio stations as of the beginning of the period

table of contents corporate general and administrative expenses december  december  dollars in millions corporate general and administrative expenses amount of change percentage change corporate general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in legal expenses of million primarily associated with certain legal proceedings in the year ended december  which did not reoccur in  and a deferred compensation expense reduction of million as a result of a decrease in the value of the unfunded obligation 
the decrease in corporate general and administrative expense was offset by an increase in non cash compensation expense of million due to a the cumulative effect of equity awards issued over multiple years  including  with the awards vesting over periods of up to four years  and b the acceleration of vesting of equity awards for a key officer 
operating income loss december  december  dollars in millions operating income loss amount of change percentage change nm the decrease in operating income to an operating loss was primarily due to an increase in an impairment loss of million in connection with our review of broadcasting licenses and goodwill during the fourth quarter of and our review of goodwill during the second quarter of see note in the accompanying notes to the financial statements  which loss was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used  a decrease in station transaction multiples  and a decrease in advertising revenue growth projections for the broadcasting industry 
this decrease in operating income was offset by i a decrease in time brokerage agreement fees of million  primarily due to the cessation of a tba with cbs on november   and ii an increase in net gain on sale or disposal of assets of million primarily related to our sale of three radio stations in seattle  washington  in connection with our bonneville exchange agreement that was completed during the first quarter of same station considerations operating loss in was not impacted by any acquisitions or dispositions of radio stations as of the beginning of the period

interest expense december  december  dollars in millions interest expense amount of change percentage change the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to i a decline in interest rates during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   and ii the repurchase during of million of our senior subordinated notes which have a higher interest rate than the replacement debt 
this decrease was offset by higher average outstanding debt under our senior credit agreement used to finance a the acquisition of radio station assets in several markets in the amount of million during the fourth quarter of  b dividend payments of million in and 
table of contents million in  and c the repurchase of our common stock in the amount of million during  and higher interest expense of million related to the resolution of certain litigation 
loss from continuing operations before income tax provision benefit december  december  dollars in millions loss from continuing operations before income tax provision benefit amount of change percentage change nm the net change was primarily attributable to an increase in impairment loss of million due to the reasons as described above under operating income loss 
the increase in loss from continuing operations before income tax provision benefit was offset by a million gain on the retirement of our senior subordinated debt  a decrease in our interest expense of million for the reasons described above under interest expense  and a million increase in other income related to an insurance recovery 
income tax provision benefit december  december  dollars in millions income tax provision benefit amount of change percentage change nm the net change in income tax provision benefit was primarily the result of the net change as described above under loss from continuing operations before income tax provision benefit 
in addition  we recorded discrete items of tax of million for the year ended december  primarily due to an increase to our valuation allowance to fully reserve our net deferred tax assets  and million for the year ended december  resulting from the commencement of operations in in states which on average have higher income tax rates than in states in which we previously operated and the resulting effect on previously reported temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities 
for the years ended december  and  our income tax rate was and  respectively 
included in the tax rate for the years ended december  and were discrete items of tax as described above in the amount of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   the income tax benefit was million  which resulted from a reduction in deferred tax liabilities primarily due to the recording of an impairment loss of million 
for the year ended december   the income tax expense of million was comprised of a current tax credit of million and a deferred tax expense of million 
we estimate that our annual tax rate for  which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  will be in the low range before any necessary adjustment to the valuation allowance 
we estimate that our rate in will be affected primarily by changes in the level of income in any of our taxing jurisdictions  adding facilities in states that on average have different income tax rates than states in which we currently operate and the resulting effect on previously reported temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities  the effect of recording changes in our financial interpretation no 
fin liabilities  and the limitations on the deduction of cash and certain non cash compensation expense for certain key employees 
our effective tax rate may also be materially impacted by i regulatory changes in certain states in which we operate  ii changes in the expected outcome of tax audits  iii changes in the estimate of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes  and iv changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
our net non current deferred tax liabilities were eliminated as of december  primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with the million impairment loss to our indefinite lived intangible assets 
our net non current deferred tax liabilities as of december  were million 
the deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to differences between book and tax bases of certain of our indefinite lived intangibles broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
under the 
table of contents provisions of sfas no 
 we do not amortize our indefinite lived intangibles for financial statement purposes  but instead test them annually for impairment 
the amortization of our indefinite lived assets for tax purposes but not for book creates deferred tax liabilities 
a reversal of deferred tax liabilities may occur when indefinite lived intangibles become impaired  or indefinite lived intangibles are sold for cash  which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company in a taxable transaction

in addition  the impairment loss recorded for the broadcasting licenses in new orleans was primarily due to the longer than expected economic recovery of the region after hurricane katrina 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment loss of million  with respect to our denver market  in connection with our review of goodwill under the provisions of sfas no 
a contributing factor to the impairment was a decline in the aggregate advertising dollars in the denver market and its effect on our operations

our net non current deferred tax liabilities were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the deferred tax liability primarily relates to differences between book and tax bases of our fcc licenses 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we do not amortize our fcc licenses for financial statement purposes  but instead test them annually for impairment 
since our fcc licenses are amortized for tax purposes  our deferred tax liability will increase over time 
we do not expect the significant portion of our deferred tax liability to reverse unless our fcc licenses become impaired  or our fcc licenses are sold for cash  which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company in a taxable transaction 
due to the impairment loss in  our deferred tax liabilities decreased by million

liquidity and capital resources our credit agreement our credit agreement the bank facility  currently with a syndicate of banks  provides for a  million senior secured credit facility that matures on june  and is comprised of million in revolving credit revolver and a million term loan term a 
the term a reduces beginning september  in quarterly amounts starting at million and increasing to million 
the revolver provides us with working capital and funds for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and any one or more of the following repurchases of class a common stock  repurchases of our senior subordinated notes  dividends and acquisitions 
the bank facility is secured by a pledge of of the capital stock and other equity interest in all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the bank facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and leverage ratios which are defined terms within the agreement  including total debt to operating cash flow of times  and operating cash flow to interest expense of times 
management believes we are in compliance with all financial covenants and leverage ratios and all other terms of the bank facility 
our former credit agreement our former credit agreement former facility consisted of a five year million as amended senior secured revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that was to mature on august  the former facility was secured by a pledge of of the capital stock and other equity interest in all of our owned subsidiaries and required us to comply with certain financial covenants and leverage ratios  which were defined terms within the agreement 
liquidity we have used a significant portion of our capital resources to acquire radio station assets  repurchase shares of our class a common stock  pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase some of our senior subordinated notes 
generally  our acquisitions  share repurchases  reductions of our outstanding debt  dividends  senior subordinated note repurchases and other capital requirements are funded from one or a combination of the following sources internally generated cash flow  our credit agreement  the sales of radio stations  and the issuance and sale of securities 
as of december   million was the maximum amount available under our current  million bank facility that matures on june  the amount available for borrowing is determined by our financial covenants  which are impacted by many factors  including but not limited to changes in our operating performance  acquisitions  dispositions and debt retirement 
assuming the use of the borrowed proceeds has no effect on operating cash flow as determined under our bank facility  as of december   million of the million is available for borrowing as a result of our bank facility s leverage ratio covenant 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended december   we decreased our net outstanding debt by million which includes a million discount on the retirement of our senior subordinated debt due in part to the cash available from the sale of a station in austin  texas  for million  million net cash proceeds made available from the sale of three radio stations in our rochester  new york  market as well as the receipt of million in refunded income taxes 
as of december   we had outstanding million in senior debt  including million under our bank facility  million in senior subordinated notes  and million in a letter of credit 
we may seek to obtain other funding or additional financing from time to time 
we believe that cash on hand and cash from operating activities  together with available borrowings under the bank facility  will be sufficient to permit us to meet our liquidity requirements in our lenders require that we must be in compliance with certain covenants in our credit agreements  and we believe that we will maintain our compliance with these covenants 
the current economic crisis has reduced demand for advertising in general  including advertising on our radio stations 
if our revenues were to be significantly less than planned due to difficult market conditions or for other reasons  our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants in our credit agreements would become increasingly difficult without remedial measures 
such remedial measures would include management s plans to further reduce operating costs and opportunistically repurchase senior subordinated notes at a discount 
if our remedial measures were not successful in maintaining covenant compliance  then we would negotiate with our lenders for relief  which relief could result in higher interest expense 
failure to comply with our financial covenants or other terms of our credit agreements and failure to negotiate relief from our lenders could result in the acceleration of the maturity of all outstanding debt 
under these circumstances  the acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in was mainly attributable to a net decrease in working capital requirements of million  primarily due to a million reduction in prepaid and refundable income taxes as we received income tax refunds in of million  a million reduction in outstanding accounts receivable  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million primarily due to million that was accrued as of december   paid in and that related to a settlement with the nyag and an investigation by the fcc 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income after excluding the effect of a non cash loss on impairment of million  net of a tax benefit of million largely due to an increase in tba fees and interest expense for the reasons described under results of operations  and an increase in working capital of million that was primarily due to a the payment in of the million in accrued expenses as of december  relating to an investigation by and settlement with the nyag plus a reserve for an investigation by the fcc  and b an increase in prepaid and refundable income taxes associated with the loss for tax purposes that will be refundable from prior years tax obligations

nyse continued listing our common stock is currently listed on the new york stock exchange nyse 
the continued listing requirements of the nyse include  among other things if the average closing price of an nyse listed company s common stock  over a consecutive trading day period  is below  then the issuer will have a six month period to cure the deficiency 
if the average market capitalization of an nyse listed company s common stock  over a consecutive trading day period  is below million  then the issuer we will be subject to immediate nyse delisting 
while the nyse rules generally do not provide for a cure period with respect to this continued listing requirement  on january   the nyse announced a temporary reduction of this threshold to million through april  if an nyse listed company s a average market capitalization  over a consecutive trading day period  is below million  and b total stockholders equity is less than  then the issuer may be subject to nyse delisting 
in such event  the listed company will have an opportunity to submit a plan to the nyse to cure such deficiency 
if the nyse accepts the plan  the issuer will have up to months to cure the deficiency 
on december   we received notice from the nyse that we were not in compliance with the minimum closing price requirement 
pursuant to nyse rules  we have advised the nyse that we intend to cure this deficiency 
in order to do so  on june  i the closing price of our common stock must be at least  and ii the average closing price of our common stock  over the preceding consecutive trading day period  must be at least 
if we fail to meet these requirements  our common stock will be subject to delisting 
accordingly  it is possible our common stock may be subject to suspension and delisting procedures 
if our common stock is delisted from the nyse  then our common stock may trade on the over the counter bulletin board 
delisting from the nyse also could make trading our common stock more difficult for our investors and negatively impact the price of our common stock 
income taxes during the year ended december   we paid a nominal amount in income taxes and during the years ended december  and  we paid income taxes of million and million  respectively 
during these years  we have benefited from the tax deductions for depreciation and amortization on acquired assets 
we anticipate that it will not be necessary to make any additional quarterly estimated federal  and most state  income tax payments for  based upon projected quarterly taxable income and our ability to utilize federal net operating loss carryforwards from and certain state net operating loss carryforwards beginning with dividends our board of directors approved dividends on a quarterly basis effective with the first quarter of through the third quarter of our board of directors did not declare a dividend for the fourth quarter of any future dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors based upon the relevant factors at the time of such consideration 
we have used a portion of our capital resources to pay dividends in the aggregate amount of million during the years ended december   and prior to the payment of our first quarterly dividend as a public company in march  we had not declared any dividends on any class of our common stock 
share repurchase programs over the past several years  our board of directors authorized several programs to repurchase our class a common stock 
under these repurchase programs  we repurchased and immediately retired in  million shares for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share  in  million shares for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share  and in  million shares for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share 
depending on market conditions and other factors  these repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
as of february   million shares remained authorized as available for repurchase under the current program that will expire on june  we expect to use cash available under our bank facility and internally generated cash flow as a source of funds to repurchase shares under the current program 
senior subordinated note repurchases on march   we issued million of senior subordinated notes due march  at december   we have million outstanding as we repurchased and retired million of the notes during the year we may from time to time seek to repurchase and retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases  open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
interest on the notes  which are in denominations of  each  accrues at the rate of per annum and is payable semi annually in arrears on march and september we may redeem the notes effective march  at a redemption price of of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
the notes are unsecured and rank junior to our senior indebtedness 
our senior subordinated notes also require us to comply with certain covenants that limit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness and to make certain payments 
the maturity could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants  which are  in general  less restrictive than the covenants under the bank facility 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in and million in we anticipate that capital expenditures in will be between million and million 
credit rating agencies on a continuing basis  credit rating agencies such as moody s investor services and standard and poor s evaluate our debt in order to assign a credit rating 
any future significant downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact our future liquidity by limiting or eliminating our ability to obtain debt financing  or include  among other things  interest rate changes under any future credit agreements  debentures  notes or other types of debt 
effective for  we have elected to discontinue our subscription to such ratings services 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than to to more than contractual obligations total year years years years amounts in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total a the maturity of our bank facility  with outstanding debt in the amount of million as of december   could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants 
b under our million senior subordinated notes  the maturity could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants or could be repaid in cash by us at our option prior to the due date of the notes 
c the above table includes projected interest expense under the remaining term of our bank facility and our senior subordinated notes 
a we have purchase obligations of million that include contracts primarily for on air personalities  sports programming rights  ratings services  music licensing fees  equipment maintenance and certain other operating contracts 
b in addition to the above  we have million in liabilities related to our obligation to provide a letter of credit and for certain construction obligations 
included within total other long term liabilities of million are fin liabilities of million  which have been reflected in the above table in the column labeled as more than years as it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact to an individual year 
see note  income taxes  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the change to deferred tax liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations 
letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
we had an outstanding letter of credit of million as of december  we enter into interest rate contracts collars and swaps to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt 
see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes at december  accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements as of december  as of december   a third party had a variable interest in several of our entities holding assets to be disposed on january   we entered into an agreement with a third party to exchange certain radio stations in cincinnati  ohio  and seattle  washington  for certain radio stations in san francisco  california  and million in cash 
concurrently with entering into this asset exchange agreement  we entered into a time brokerage agreement 
the provisions of fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 include any variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
in connection with this transaction  we determined that fin r was applicable as the buyer had a variable interest in and was the primary beneficiary of our entity that contained the cincinnati radio station assets 
as the primary beneficiary  the purchaser could incur the expected losses that could arise from the variability of the fair value of the variable interest entity vie 
as a result  as of december  we deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of those entities holding our cincinnati assets into a balance sheet classification as an investment in deconsolidated subsidiaries in the amount of million 
the investment in deconsolidated subsidiaries reflects the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the variable interest entity that contain the cincinnati assets that were disposed of in the first quarter of under the asset exchange agreement see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the bonneville disposition

fas no 
r  which is effective for us as of january   will apply to all business combinations that will close on or after january  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or by using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be important in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
based upon past experience  the use of these criteria has been a reliable method to recognize revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure to make payments to us 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and changes in our customer payment practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical estimates have been a reliable method to estimate future allowances 
our historical reserves have averaged less than of our outstanding receivables 
due to the recent economic downturn and its effect on our business and our customer base  we increased our accounts receivable reserve to as of december  if the financial condition of our customers or markets were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances could be required 
our basic and diluted net loss per share would be negatively impacted by  assuming a increase in our outstanding accounts receivable allowance of million as of december  net of a full valuation allowance against any tax benefit 

table of contents radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
as of december   we have recorded approximately million in radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill  which represents of our total assets at that date 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must conduct impairment testing required by sfas no 
and charge to operations an impairment expense only in the periods in which the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value 
in  we recorded an impairment loss of million for radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
we believe our estimate of the value of our radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimate of the value uses assumptions that incorporate variables based on past experiences and judgments about future performance of our stations 
these variables include but are not limited to the forecast growth rate of each radio market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  risk adjusted discount rate  the likely media competition within the market area  and terminal values 
changes in our estimates of the fair value of these assets could result in material future period write downs in the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
please refer to note  intangible assets and goodwill  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of several key assumptions used in the fair value estimate of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill during our fourth quarter interim impairment test 
market capitalization as of december   our total market capitalization was million less than our equity book value 
we believe this difference can be attributed to the recent volatility of our stock price in the current economic environment and to the control premium that a market participant may pay in the event we were acquired 
in the accompanying notes to the financial statements  please refer to note  intangible assets and goodwill  for a discussion of the impact to our equity book value as a result of the fourth quarter impairment loss 
contingencies and litigation on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our exposure related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
estimation of our tax rates we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments must be used in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities because of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
in  we recorded a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets primarily due to our cumulative losses over the past three years 
as changes occur in our assessments regarding our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision is decreased in any period in which we determine that the recovery is probable 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities requires us to account for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation of fin the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit based upon its technical merits  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions  and review whether any new uncertain tax positions have arisen  on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  historical experience with similar tax matters  guidance from our tax advisors  and new audit activity 
a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period in which the change occurs 

table of contents we believe our estimates of the value of our tax contingencies and valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates  as they contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
in past years  our estimate of our tax rate has varied from to 
for  if we excluded the discrete items of tax including the increase in our valuation allowance and the impairment loss  then our tax rate would have been in the low percent range 
the effect of a increase in our estimated tax rate as of december   would be a decrease in the income tax benefit of million before the impact of a change in the valuation allowance and an increase in net loss of million net loss per basic and diluted common share of for the year ended december  
valuation of share based compensation we determine the fair value of restricted stock units with service and market conditions using a monte carlo simulation model 
the fair value is based on the use of certain assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
if other reasonable assumptions were used  the results could differ 
we determine the fair value of our employee stock options at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from these traded options 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate our radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are subject to renewal every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
subject to delays in processing by the fcc  historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
see part i  item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the risks associated with the renewal of licenses 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for radio station operating expenses  including wages and equipment 
the exact impact cannot be reasonably determined 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank facility 
from time to time  we may seek to limit our exposure to interest rate volatility through the use of derivative rate hedging instruments 
if the borrowing rates under our libor loans were to increase above the rates as of december   our interest expense under our bank facility would increase by approximately million on an annual basis  including any interest benefit or interest expense associated with the use of outstanding derivative rate hedging instruments 
we do not have interest rate risk related to our senior subordinated notes  which have a fixed interest rate of 
during the year ended december   we entered into the following derivative rate hedging transactions in the aggregate notional amount of million to fix interest on our variable rate debt 
these rate hedging transactions are tied to the one month libor interest rate

the fair value based upon current market rates of the rate hedging transactions is included as derivative instruments in long term assets and or liabilities as the maturity dates are greater than one year 
our rate hedging transactions are tied to the one month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the fair value of the hedging transaction is affected by a combination of several factors  including the change in the one month libor rate and the forward interest rate to maturity 
any increase in the one month libor rate and or the forward interest rate to maturity results in a more favorable valuation  while any decrease in the one month libor rate and or forward interest rate to maturity results in a less favorable valuation 
the fair value of our derivative instruments outstanding as of december  was a liability of million  which was a million change from the fair value of the derivative instruments at their inception in this negative change was primarily due to the effect of a decrease in the forward interest rate to maturity 
our credit exposure under our hedging agreements  or similar agreements we may enter into in the future  is the cost of replacing such agreements in the event of non performance by our counter party 
to minimize this risk  we select high credit quality counter parties 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by such counter parties  and no material loss would be expected in the event of the counter parties nonperformance 
our cash equivalents are money market instruments consisting of short term government securities and repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by government securities 
we do not believe that we have any material credit exposure with respect to these assets 
our credit exposure related to our accounts receivable does not represent a significant concentration of credit risk due to the quantity of advertisers  the minimal reliance on any one advertiser  the multiple markets in which we operate and the wide variety of advertising business sectors
