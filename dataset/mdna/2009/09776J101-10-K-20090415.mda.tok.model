item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general we compete in the department store segment of the us retail industry 
founded in  the company is one of the largest regional department store operators  offering a broad assortment of brand name fashion apparel and accessories for women  men and children as well as cosmetics  home furnishings and other goods 
we currently operate stores in states in the northeast  midwest and upper great plains under the bon ton  bergner s  boston store  carson pirie scott  elder beerman  herberger s and younkers nameplates and  under the parisian nameplate  stores in the detroit  michigan area  encompassing a total of approximately million square feet 
the company had net sales of billion in effective march   we purchased all of the outstanding securities of two subsidiaries of saks that were solely related to the business of owning and operating retail department stores 
the stores are located in states in the midwest and upper great plains regions and operate under the names carson pirie scott  younkers  herberger s  boston store and bergner s 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we paid approximately billion in cash for carson s 
to finance the acquisition and the payoff of our previous revolving credit facility  we entered into a new revolving credit facility which provides for up to billion in borrowings  issued million in senior unsecured notes  and entered into a new mortgage loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of million 
on october   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with belk  pursuant to which we agreed to purchase assets in connection with four department stores  all operated under the parisian nameplate  and the rights to construct a new parisian store  which opened in october the purchase price was million in cash 
in addition  we agreed to assume specific liabilities and obligations of belk and its affiliates with respect to the acquired parisian stores 
the acquisition of these parisian stores was effective as of october  economic factors and company performance our performance in reflects the declining us economy and record low consumer confidence that have greatly impacted the retail industry  including the department store sector 
a wide range of factors contributed to the difficult economic environment a poor housing market  high energy costs  mortgage and credit market concerns  rising unemployment and a loss of wealth due to the decline in the stock market 
we believe that  for these reasons  consumers were less willing to spend their discretionary income 
while we prudently managed variables within our control inventory investment  operating expenses and capital expenditures in response to the deteriorating economic situation  we were unable to counteract the severe external pressures 
as a result  we reported a decline in sales and gross margin  as well as considerable asset impairments and an income tax valuation allowance adjustment  resulting in a significant loss for the year 
given the outlook of continued recessionary factors  we anticipate another difficult year in assumptions in our projections include a comparable store sales decrease in the range of to  a reduction in other income  a gross margin rate of to  a reduction of million in our sg a expenses  and an effective tax rate of 
in response to the deepening economic crisis  we have implemented a cost savings plan in which builds upon the expense control efforts initiated in  actions taken include the reduction of corporate and store personnel  the elimination of bonus payments for senior executives and merit based wage increases for all associates  the suspension of employer contributions to our k plan  and the reduction of capital spending and inventory levels 
the impact of these actions is estimated to be an annualized increase in income from operations of million 
our cash flow in will benefit from these savings as well as the lower capital spending 
summary of charges in  we recognized material non cash charges which we believe are primarily a result of the downturn in our business and the expectation that current economic challenges will impede near term recovery in the retail sector 
our assessment of the recoverability of these assets considered company specific projections  assumptions about market rates and transactions and  in the case of goodwill  our market capitalization at the time of testing 
as a result of the reviews  the following charges were recorded dollars in millions  except per share data earnings per category charge diluted share goodwill impairment pre tax long lived assets impairment pre tax intangible assets impairment pre tax deferred tax valuation allowance adjustment after tax the charges noted above compare unfavorably with a per share impact for asset impairment charges of in results of operations the following table summarizes changes in our selected operating indicators  illustrating the relationship of various income and expense items to net sales for each year presented components may not add or subtract to totals because of rounding percent of net sales net sales other income costs and expenses costs of merchandise sold selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization amortization of lease related interests goodwill impairment other impairment charges loss income from operations interest expense  net loss income before income taxes income tax provision net loss income compared with net sales net sales in decreased to  million from  million in comparable store sales decreased from the prior year 
we believe the comparable store sales decline reflects a confluence of factors that created an adverse economic environment throughout the year  particularly the last quarter of  which weakened consumer sentiment and pressured spending 
the best performing merchandise category in the period was children s apparel 
sales increases in this category primarily reflect expanded and improved product selection in branded playwear and outerwear 
the poorest performing categories in the period were furniture included in home and moderate sportswear and dresses both included in women s apparel 
furniture sales were impacted by the difficult housing market in new construction and existing home sales  and continued deterioration in consumer spending for more expensive items 
moderate sportswear and dresses have been impacted by the challenging economic environment  which has resulted in reduced consumer spending on discretionary items 
sales in moderate sportswear were also affected by the decision made in by certain of our key vendors to exit the moderate sportswear business 
it was not until the fall of that we began receiving merchandise from new  replacement vendors 
other income other income  which includes income from revenues received under our credit card program agreement with hsbc  leased departments and other customer revenues  was million  or of net sales  in as compared with million  or of net sales  in the decrease primarily reflects reduced sales volume in the current year 
costs and expenses gross margin dollars in were  million as compared with  million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in gross margin dollars reflects the reduced sales volume and a decrease in the gross margin rate 
gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased percentage points to in the current year from in the prior year 
the decrease in the gross margin rate primarily reflects an increased net markdown rate in response to the challenging economic environment 
sg a expense in was  million as compared with  million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease primarily resulted from expense reductions in payroll  benefits and advertising in response to our sales trend 
other expense reductions were due to increased efficiencies in operations and prior year store closing expenses 
despite the expense savings  the expense rate in increased percentage points to of net sales  compared with in  due to the reduced sales volume 
in  depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of lease related interests increased million  to million  from million in we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the second quarter of in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

based upon our review  the fair value of our single reporting unit  estimated using a combination of our common stock trading value as of the end of the second quarter of  a discounted cash flow analysis and other generally accepted valuation methodologies  was less than the carrying amount 
there was no such charge in see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 we recorded million of non cash asset impairment charges which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of certain store properties 
we recorded charges of million for asset impairments in see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  a review was completed of the carrying value of certain intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of our assessment  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million related to the reduction in the value of four indefinite lived trade names and two indefinite lived private label brand names 
in  we recorded impairment charges of million related to the reduction in the value of two indefinite lived private label brand names 
see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
loss income from operations the loss from operations in was million  or of net sales  as compared with income from operations of million  or of net sales  in interest expense  net net interest expense in was million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  in the million decrease primarily reflects decreased borrowing levels and reduced interest rates in the current year and million of prior year expense incurred for the early extinguishment of debt 
income tax provision the income tax provision reflects an effective tax rate of in  compared with in the income tax provision includes an unfavorable million tax expense adjustment in the fourth quarter of pursuant to establishment of an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and a favorable million tax benefit adjustment in the third quarter of related to expiration of certain exposures pursuant to the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no

net loss income net loss in was million  or of net sales  as compared with net income of million  or of net sales  in compared with consisted of weeks  while consisted of weeks 
comparability between the periods is also affected by the inclusion of five additional weeks of carson s operations in the first quarter of  the prior year period includes carson s operations following the march  acquisition 
net sales net sales in increased to  million from  million in the total sales increase reflects the inclusion of the five additional weeks of sales from carson s in the first quarter of as well as sales at the acquired parisian stores  partially offset by a reduction for closed stores and the inclusion of an additional week of sales in the prior year  reflective of the fifty three week fiscal period 
the balance of sales in reflects a bon ton comparable store net sales decrease of and  for informational purposes only  a full year carson s comparable store net sales decrease of  which  in total  approximates million 
we believe that the comparable store net sales decline was the result of several factors including  among others a challenging economic environment  the result of a weak housing market  mortgage and credit market concerns and rising energy prices  which pressured consumer spending 
unseasonable weather in our geographic regions in april  september  october and december  which negatively impacted apparel sales 
the elimination of the prior year liquidation of non go forward merchandise in bon ton stores 
the quantifiable impact of the liquidation sales in the prior year was approximately million in the home area alone 
we believe there were incremental sales generated in the prior year from increased customer traffic as a result of the liquidation event  the effect of which cannot be discretely quantified 
the best performing merchandise categories in the period were children s apparel  footwear and better sportswear included in women s apparel 
children s apparel benefited from increased inventory investment and the introduction of new vendors and licensed product 
sales increases in footwear were primarily the result of increased inventory investment and the expansion of certain vendors into additional stores 
better sportswear sales increased as customers responded favorably to our new and expanded offerings of private brand merchandise and key branded vendors 
the poorest performing categories in the period were home which includes furniture  moderate sportswear and coats both included in women s apparel 
the sales decrease in home was primarily due to the elimination of the prior year liquidation event  the impact of which was particularly significant in the second quarter of  and the concerns in the housing market 
sales in coats and moderate sportswear were adversely impacted by the unseasonable weather 
moderate sportswear was also affected by the decision made by certain of our key vendors to exit the moderate sportswear business  the company was unable to develop sufficient new merchandise resources to mitigate the sales volume erosion in other income other income  which includes income from revenues received under our credit card program agreement with hsbc  leased departments and other customer revenues  was million  or of net sales  in as compared with million  or of net sales  in the increase in dollars was primarily due to the inclusion of thirteen weeks of carson s operations in the first quarter of as compared with eight weeks of carson s post acquisition operations in the first quarter of and increased revenues received under the credit card program agreement  partially offset by the inclusion of an additional week of operations in the prior year 
costs and expenses gross margin dollars in were  million as compared with  million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in gross margin dollars primarily reflects the reduced sales volume attributable to the comparable store sales decrease and a decrease in the gross margin rate 
gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased percentage point to in the current year from in the prior year 
the decrease in the gross margin rate reflects the inclusion of carson s sales and markdowns for the first five weeks of the current year  this historically clearance driven period with reduced margins was not included in the prior year period 
additionally  the gross margin rate was impacted by increased net markdowns in the third and fourth quarters of  the result of increased promotional activity in response to unseasonable weather conditions and the challenging economic environment 
sg a expense in was  million as compared with  million in  an increase of million 
the principal factors in the increase in sg a expense were the inclusion of five incremental weeks of carson s operations in the first quarter of as compared with the first quarter of and increases in those costs affected by normal inflationary adjustments 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in integration expenses  increased efficiencies in operations in and the inclusion of an additional week of operations in the prior year 
the expense rate increased percentage point to 
depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of lease related interests increased million  to million  in from million in  primarily the result of including thirteen weeks of carson s operations in the first quarter of as compared with eight weeks of carson s operations in the first quarter of as well as the increased expense associated with asset additions 
in we recorded million of asset impairment charges which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of certain store properties  as compared with million of charges in for an impaired store property and a reduction in the value of duplicate information systems software 
additionally  in we recorded an impairment charge of million related to a reduction in the value of two indefinite lived private label brand names 
there was no such charge in income from operations income from operations in was million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  in interest expense  net net interest expense in was million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  in the million increase is principally due to the net additional weeks of interest expense on debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of carson s compared with such interest expense in the prior year  partially offset by a prior year charge of million for the write off of fees associated with a bridge facility and the early extinguishment of previous debt 
income tax provision the income tax provision reflects an effective tax rate of in as compared with in included in the prior year provision is an income tax benefit adjustment of million principally associated with a net reduction in income tax valuation allowances 
net income net income in was million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  in liquidity and capital resources at january   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million available under our asset based revolving credit facility before taking into account the minimum borrowing availability of million 
the borrowing base calculation under our revolving credit facility contains an inventory advance rate subject to periodic review at the lender s discretion 
based upon the most recent inventory appraisal in february  we realized a decrease in our advance rate  the effect of which would have reduced borrowing availability by million had the new advance rate been applied to our calculation at january  while much of the reported loss in resulted from material non cash charges for asset impairments and deferred tax valuation allowances  our operating performance decreased as well 
in anticipation of continued recessionary pressures in  we have heightened our focus on maximizing operating cash flow and have significantly curtailed our planned capital expenditures 
additionally  we will continue to control inventory levels in order to benefit our working capital needs 
we anticipate that these actions  together with projected cash benefits from our cost savings initiatives  will positively impact our cash flow 
our business is dependent to a significant degree upon close relationships with our vendors and their factors 
the loss of key vendor or factor support could have a material adverse effect on our business 
given the weak global markets  vendors and factors may seek assurances to protect against non payment of amounts due them 
if we continue to experience declining operating performance  and if we experience severe liquidity challenges  vendors and factors may demand that we accelerate our payment for their products 
these demands could have a significant adverse impact on our operating cash flow and result in a severe diminishment of our liquidity 
under such circumstances  borrowings under our existing credit facility could reach maximum levels  in which case we would take actions to obtain additional liquidity 
however  there can be no assurance that we would be successful obtaining such additional liquidity 
as a result  we may not be able to meet our obligations as they become due 
in addition  if our vendors are unable to access liquidity or become insolvent  they could be unable to supply us with product or continue with their support of our advertising and promotional programs 
any such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to acquire merchandise or obtain vendor allowances in support of our advertising and promotional programs  which in turn could have an adverse impact on our business  operating results  financial condition or cash flow 
historically  we have generated cash flow from operating activities and used supplemental borrowings under our credit facility to provide the liquidity we need to operate our business 
the downturn in the global economy and the recent distress in the financial markets have resulted in extreme volatility in the capital markets and diminished liquidity and credit availability 
the tightening of credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds  to refinance our existing indebtedness  to enter into agreements for new indebtedness or to obtain funding through the issuance of securities and could potentially increase our borrowing costs 
if such conditions were to persist  we would seek alternative sources of liquidity  but there can be no assurance that we would be successful obtaining such additional liquidity 
as a result  we may be unable to meet our obligations as they become due 
typically  cash flows from operations are impacted by consumer confidence  weather in the geographic markets served by the company  and economic and competitive conditions existing in the retail industry  a downturn in any single factor or a combination of factors could have a material adverse impact upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to operate our business 
currently  our business model is adversely impacted by additional economic drivers reflective of the global recession 
while the current and anticipated future difficult economic conditions affect our assessment of short term liquidity  we consider our resources cash flows from operations supplemented by borrowings under the credit facility adequate to satisfy our cash needs 
while there can be no assurances  management believes there should be sufficient liquidity to cover our short term funding needs 
the following table summarizes material measures of our liquidity and capital resources january  february  february  dollars in millions working capital current ratio debt to total capitalization unused availability under lines of credit debt includes obligations under capital leases 
total capitalization includes shareholders equity  debt and obligations under capital leases 
subject to a minimum borrowing availability covenant of based upon the most recent inventory appraisal in february  unused availability under lines of credit would have been reduced by had the new advance rate been applied to our calculation at january  our primary sources of working capital are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our business follows a seasonal pattern  working capital fluctuates with seasonal variations  reaching its highest level in october or november to fund the purchase of merchandise inventories prior to the holiday season 
working capital levels decreased minimally between and the increase in the current ratio in  as compared with  primarily reflects proportionately larger decreases in current liabilities as compared with current assets  principally due to reduced accrued liabilities relating to benefits 
the increase in debt to total capitalization is largely due to the significant decrease in shareholders equity in  the result of the net loss for the period as well as a decline in the funded status of the company s defined benefit pension plans 
the decrease in unused availability under lines of credit as compared with the prior year reflects decreased availability primarily due to reduced inventory levels as well as increased documentary letters of credit to support the purchasing of inventory 
increases in working capital and the current ratio in  as compared with  largely reflect reductions in accrued liabilities and income taxes payable 
the decrease in debt to total capitalization reflects cash flow generated in utilized to reduce debt levels 
the increase in unused availability under lines of credit as compared with the prior year primarily reflects decreases in direct borrowings and standby letters of credit to support the importing of merchandise and as collateral for obligations related to general liability and workers compensation insurance 
cash provided by used in our operating  investing and financing activities is summarized as follows dollars in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in as compared with largely reflects a decrease in business performance  resulting in the current year loss compared with prior year income  partially offset by increased non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization  impairment charges for long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  and the increase in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
we sought to reduce our working capital needs and  accordingly  reduced inventory levels in and we plan to continue to control inventory levels in the change in cash flows from operating activities in primarily reflects decreases in merchandise inventories due to inventory management efforts in response to sales trends  partially offset by a reduction in net income 
we invested million  million and million in capital expenditures not reduced by landlord contributions in  and  respectively 
these investments were for the opening  expanding and remodeling of stores as well as investments in information technology 
additional capital investment of  million in was expended for the acquisition of carson s and parisian 
we have significantly reduced our capital expenditures in response to current economic conditions and expect capital expenditures to total approximately million net of approximately million of landlord contributions in  as we are limiting store expansion and remodel activities in the near term 
included in future capital expenditures is continued investment in information technology for on going efforts to implement bon ton s advanced point of sale system in the carson s stores 
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in as compared with primarily reflects net payments made to reduce long term debt in  the result of increased operating cash flows in that year 
proceeds from the issuance of long term debt totaled  million in  reflecting increased borrowings to fund the acquisitions of carson s and parisian

the borrowing base calculation under the senior secured credit facility contains an inventory advance rate subject to periodic review at the lender s discretion 
based upon the most recent inventory appraisal in february  we realized a decrease in our advance rate  the effect of which would have reduced borrowing availability by million had the new advance rate been applied to our calculation at january  on april   we elected to reduce our commitment under our senior secured credit facility to million from the previous billion  which will reduce interest expense associated with the unused commitment fee

these purchase orders do not contain any significant termination payments or other penalties if cancelled 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affected reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to merchandise returns  bad debts  inventories  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  financings  contingencies  insurance reserves  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially lead to materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as described below 
for a discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margin is derived by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry 
use of the retail inventory method will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are taken timely as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact both the ending inventory valuation at cost and the resulting gross margin 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  result in individual inventory components with cost above related net realizable value 
factors that can lead to this result include applying the retail inventory method to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost  selling price relationship and turnover  or applying the retail inventory method to transactions that include different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise 
in addition  failure to take timely markdowns can result in an overstatement of inventory under the lower of cost or market principle 
we believe that the retail inventory method we use provides an inventory valuation that approximates cost and results in carrying inventory in the aggregate at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record an adjustment for excess or old inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of merchandise demand for the selling season 
demand for merchandise can fluctuate greatly 
a significant increase in the demand for merchandise could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future merchandise demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the adjustment required for excess or old inventory 
if our inventory is determined to be overvalued in the future  we would be required to recognize such costs in costs of goods sold and reduce operating income at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is later determined to be undervalued  we may have overstated the costs of goods sold in previous periods and would recognize additional operating income when such inventory is sold 
therefore  although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future merchandise demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or in economic conditions within our markets could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
prior to the carson s acquisition  we utilized the last in  first out lifo cost basis for all of our inventories 
in connection with the carson s acquisition  we evaluated the inventory costing for the acquired inventories and elected the first in  first out fifo cost basis for the majority of the acquired carson s locations 
as of january  and february   approximately of our inventories were valued using a fifo cost basis and approximately of our inventories were valued using a lifo cost basis 
as is currently the case with many companies in the retail industry  our lifo calculations yielded inventory increases due to deflation reflected in price indices used 
the lifo method values merchandise sold at the cost of more recent inventory purchases which the deflationary indices indicated to be lower  resulting in the general inventory on hand being carried at the older  higher costs 
given these higher values and the promotional retail environment  we have reduced the carrying value of our lifo inventories to an estimated realizable value 
these reductions totaled million and million as of january  and february   respectively 
inherent in the valuation of inventories are significant management judgments and estimates regarding future merchandise selling costs and pricing 
should these estimates prove to be inaccurate  we may have overstated or understated our inventory carrying value 
in such cases  operating results would ultimately be impacted 
vendor allowances as is standard industry practice  allowances from merchandise vendors are received as reimbursement for charges incurred on marked down merchandise 
vendor allowances are generally credited to costs of goods sold  provided the allowance is collectable  for merchandise either permanently marked down or sold  not predicated on a future purchase  not predicated on a future increase in the purchase price from the vendor  and authorized by internal management 
if the aforementioned criteria are not met  the allowances are reflected as an adjustment to the cost of merchandise capitalized in inventory 
additionally  allowances are received from vendors in connection with cooperative advertising programs and for reimbursement of certain payroll expenses 
these allowances received from each vendor are reviewed to ensure reimbursements are for specific  incremental and identifiable advertising or payroll costs incurred to sell the vendor s products 
if a vendor reimbursement exceeds the costs incurred  the excess reimbursement is recorded as a reduction of cost purchases from the vendor and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold 
all other amounts are recognized as a reduction of the related advertising or payroll costs that have been incurred and reflected in sg a expense 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 the process involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period  an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the statement of operations 
our net deferred tax assets were million and million at january  and february   respectively 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we considered whether it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized based upon all available evidence  including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical operating results  projected future operating results  tax carry back availability  and limitations pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  among others 
pursuant to sfas no 
 significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
as a result  a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than any projected future taxable income 
in addition  a recent three year historical cumulative loss is considered a significant element of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome 
we evaluated our deferred tax assets each reporting period  including assessment of the company s cumulative income over the prior three year period  to determine if valuation allowances were required 
a significant element of negative evidence was the company s three year historical cumulative loss as of the fourth quarter of this  combined with uncertain near term economic conditions  reduced our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in establishing the deferred tax assets valuation allowance at january  accordingly  a full valuation allowance was established during the fourth quarter of on nearly all the company s net deferred tax assets  resulting in a tax expense adjustment of million 
we recorded a valuation allowance of million and million at january  and february   respectively 
if actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
if sufficient positive evidence arises in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets meet the more likely than not standard under sfas no 
 the valuation allowance would be reversed accordingly in the period that such a conclusion is reached 
effective february   we adopted the provisions of fin no 
 which prescribes a recognition and derecognition threshold and measurement element for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
accordingly  we establish reserves for certain tax positions that we believe are supportable  but are potentially subject to successful challenge by applicable taxing authorities 
however  interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
changes in our assumptions and judgments could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
long lived assets property  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in our business model or capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from estimates 
in cases where we determined that the useful life of property  fixtures and equipment should be shortened  we depreciated the net book value in excess of the salvage value over the revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or leasehold improvements could also result in shortened useful lives 
our net property  fixtures and equipment amounted to million and million at january  and february   respectively 
sfas no 
requires the company to test a long lived asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance of stores relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends for a sustained period 
if the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are insufficient to support the recorded asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
cash flow estimates are based on historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
estimates of fair value are calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
should cash flow estimates differ significantly from actual results  an impairment could arise and materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
given the seasonality of operations  impairment is not conclusive  in many cases  until after the holiday period in the fourth quarter is concluded 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type  store location  current marketplace awareness of private label brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results 
if conditions prove to be substantially different from expectations  the carrying value of new stores long lived assets may ultimately become impaired 
we evaluated the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
as a result  in we recognized a million asset impairment charge which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of certain store properties 
these analyses anticipate continued difficult economic conditions 
should economic conditions result that are worse than anticipated  additional impairment charges could result 
in we recorded million of asset impairment charges which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of certain store properties 
impairment losses of million  which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of a store property and a reduction in the value of duplicate information systems software resulting from the acquisition of carson s  were recorded in goodwill and intangible assets net intangible assets totaled million and million at january  and february   respectively 
our intangible assets at january  are principally comprised of million of lease interests that relate to below market rate leases and million associated with trade names  private label brand names and customer lists 
the lease related interests are being amortized using a straight line method 
the customer lists are being amortized using a declining balance method 
at january   lease related interests and customer lists had average remaining lives of fourteen years and ten years  respectively  for amortization purposes 
at january   trade names and private label brand names of million have been deemed as having indefinite lives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
fair value is determined using quoted market prices and or a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors 
our policy is to conduct impairment testing based on our most current business plans  which reflect anticipated changes in the economy and the industry 
we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the second quarter of in accordance with sfas no 
based upon our review  the fair value of our single reporting unit  estimated using a combination of our common stock trading value as of the end of the second quarter of  a discounted cash flow analysis and other generally accepted valuation methodologies  was less than the carrying amount 
the charge reduced the balance of goodwill to zero at january  from the million balance at february  no such charge was recorded in or other indefinite lived intangible assets were reviewed in the second quarter of as well  with the determination that no impairment adjustments were required on these assets at that time 
because of the significant economic downturn experienced during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed the intangible assets for impairment and recognized asset impairment charges of million and million on indefinite lived trade names and private label brand names  respectively 
as a result of our review of the carrying value of intangible assets for  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to the reduction in the value of two indefinite lived private label brand names 
no such charge was recorded in while the value of intangible assets has been substantially reduced  should future results or economic events cause a change in our projected cash flows  future determination of fair value may not support the carrying amount of these assets 
if actual results prove inconsistent with our assumptions and judgments  we could be exposed to a material impairment charge 
insurance reserve estimates we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks  including workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by our associates 
we determine the estimates for the liabilities associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
a change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which we operate could result in a change to the required reserve levels 
pension and supplementary retirement plans we provide an unfunded supplementary pension plan to certain key executives 
through acquisitions  we acquired a defined benefit pension plan and assumed the liabilities of three supplementary pension plans and a postretirement benefit plan 
major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on the defined benefit plan s assets 
the discount rate assumption is evaluated annually 
we utilize the citibank pension discount curve cpdc to develop the discount rate assumption 
the cpdc is developed from a us treasury par curve that reflects the treasury coupon and strips market 
option adjusted spreads drawn from the double a corporate bond sector are layered in to develop a double a corporate par curve  from which the cpdc spot rates are developed 
the cpdc spot rates are applied to expected benefit payments  from which a single constant discount rate can then be developed based on the expected timing of these benefit payments 
we base our asset return assumption on current and expected allocations of assets  as well as a long term view of expected returns on the plan asset categories 
we assess the appropriateness of the expected rate of return on an annual basis and  when necessary  revise the assumption 
our target pension plan asset allocation of equity securities  fixed income and real estate at january  and february  was  and  respectively 
changes in the assumptions regarding the discount rate and expected return on plan assets may result in materially different expense and liability amounts 
actuarial estimations may differ materially from actual results  reflecting many factors including changing market and economic conditions  changes in investment strategies  higher or lower withdrawal rates and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
in addition  while we are not required to make any mandatory contributions to the defined benefit pension plan in  the funded status of this plan and the related cost reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty  particularly in the current economic environment 
under the pension protection act of  continued losses of asset values may necessitate increased funding of the defined benefit pension plan in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements 
the continued downward pressure on the asset values of the defined benefit pension plan may require us to fund obligations earlier than we forecasted  which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operations 
in the first quarter of  we paid million pursuant to the termination of one of our unfunded supplemental pension plans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and financial instruments we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
to provide some protection against potential rate increases associated with our variable rate facilities  we enter into derivative financial transactions in the form of interest rate swaps 
the interest rate swaps are used to hedge a portion of the underlying variable rate facilities 
the swaps are qualifying hedges and the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps 
at january   we held two variable to fixed rate swaps with a notional amount of million each 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  rather  it is used as the basis to calculate amounts due and to be received under the rate swap 
during and  we did not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations and the interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at january  for the interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amount and weighted average pay and receive interest rates by expected maturity date 
for additional discussion of our interest rate swaps  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
expected maturity date by year dollars in there thousands after total fair value debt fixed rate debt average fixed rate variable rate debt average variable rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swap variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate seasonality and inflation our business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal fluctuations  with the major portion of sales and income realized during the second half of each fiscal year  which includes the holiday season 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the company s quarterly results for and due to the fixed nature of certain costs  sg a expense is typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first half of each year 
working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as well and generally reach their highest levels during the third and fourth quarters 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full year 
in addition  quarterly operating results are impacted by the timing and amount of revenues and costs associated with the opening of new stores and the closing and remodeling of existing stores 
although we cannot determine the precise effects of inflation on our business  we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on operating results during the past three years 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by material inflationary adjustments in the future
