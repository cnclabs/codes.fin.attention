financial liquidity and capital resources overview as a distributor  the company s use of capital is largely for working capital to support its revenue base 
capital commitments for property  plant and equipment are limited to information technology assets  warehouse 
table of contents equipment  office furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  since the company operates almost entirely from leased facilities 
therefore  in any given reporting period  the amount of cash consumed or generated by operations will primarily be due to changes in working capital as a result of the rate of sales increase or decline 
in periods when sales are increasing  the expanded working capital needs will be funded first by cash from operations  secondly from additional borrowings and lastly from additional equity offerings 
also  the company will  from time to time  issue or retire borrowings or equity in an effort to maintain a cost effective capital structure consistent with its anticipated capital requirements 
in periods when sales are decreasing  the company will have improved cash flows due to reduced working capital requirements 
during such periods  the company will use the expanded cash flow to reduce the amount of leverage in its capital structure until such time as sales growth resumes

while the company s ongoing strategy remains consistent and focused on the long term  the evolving macro environment necessitated a shift in management s immediate focus in the fourth quarter 
the company moved from concentrating primarily on sales and earnings growth to focusing on cost and working capital management 
this shift in emphasis recognizes that with appropriate working capital management adjustments to address the slower economic environment  the company s business can be a strong generator of cash 
with an expectation that global recession conditions will persist for some portion or all of  the company anticipates that sales will be less than those reported for as a result  the improved cash flow that will be derived from a combination of earnings and lower working capital requirements will be used to reduce borrowings and provide improved liquidity 
the company believes that earnings  additional cash flow generated as a result of lower working capital requirements due to expected lower near term sales growth as a result of the global recession  and approximately million in available  committed  unused credit lines will be sufficient to fund operations  as well as the potential put of its zero coupon convertible notes due in july for million or an inability to renew its accounts receivable securitization facility in september at the end of  the company had million of borrowings under this facility

results of operations executive overview and outlook the company competes with distributors and manufacturers who sell products directly or through existing distribution channels to end users or other resellers

risk factors 
in  recessionary economic conditions produced decelerating year on year growth rates from those of the past few years 
the company nonetheless reported record sales for the year of  million  which was an increase of versus the prior year 
this growth was aided by acquisitions that added million to sales offset by a slightly stronger us dollar throughout the year that decreased sales by million 
excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange effects  sales in were up versus the prior year 
while the company experienced solid growth during the first half of  recessionary economic conditions negatively impacted sales growth rates during the second half of the year 
although the sales growth in the third and fourth quarters of was modest due to a challenging global economic environment  sequential organic sales declined approximately between the third and fourth quarters of which is consistent with historical and expected sequential organic sales trends between these two periods 
although fiscal was challenging due to the recessionary economic conditions  progress was made on the company s major initiatives during specifically  the company made progress on the initiatives to grow the company s security business  drive organic growth in the oem supply business  initiate a factory automation network sales effort  add to the supply chain services offering  enlarge the geographic presence of the electrical wire and cable business  expand the company s product offering and continue to expand business in the emerging markets 
operating income in was million versus million in operating margins were in as compared to in while operating earnings through the first nine months showed year on year growth and operating margins approximated the record operating margins achieved for all of  an acceleration of the macro economic decline in the fourth quarter resulted in a number of negatives 
a significant slowdown in sales activity in the last few months of produced operating de leveraging in the fourth quarter that resulted in a decline in operating margins of approximately basis points as compared to the first nine months of the year 
operating income was further impacted by the following pre tax charges in the company recorded a non cash charge in north america of million million  net of tax related to amendments made to the employment contract of the company s recently retired chief executive officer ceo which extended the terms of his non competition and non solicitation restrictions in exchange for extended vesting and termination provisions of previously granted equity awards 
deteriorating credit markets and economic conditions resulted in two large customer bankruptcies  netversant solutions inc and nortel networks inc  which resulted in bad debt losses of million million  net of tax in north america and million million  net of tax in europe 

table of contents in response to the substantially lower sales levels during the fourth quarter  the company undertook a series of actions that resulted in the recognition of million of expense million  net of tax in north america and million million  net of tax in europe related to severance costs and facility lease write offs 
these actions are expected to reduce future operating costs by approximately million annually 
during the fourth quarter  the company also recorded a million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment million  net of tax in europe with respect to certain wire and cable product lines where the depth of current inventory positions likely exceed market inventory levels such that it is probable that by the time the company sells through its current inventory of those products it will not be able to realize a profit on those products 
excluding the items outlined above of million  operating income in was million  which represents a slight decrease of as compared to  while operating margins were versus in in addition to the after tax impact of million for the above mentioned items  net income for was also impacted by the following items in  the company recorded foreign exchange losses of million million after tax due to both a sharp change in the relationship between the us dollar and all of the major currencies in which the company conducts its business and  for several weeks  a period of highly volatile conditions in the foreign exchange markets 
specifically  during the latter part of the us dollar reversed its multi year slide against the world s major currencies  with as much as  or more than  a percent change in value against individual foreign currencies in the period of one month 
while the company has had historically effective hedging programs to mitigate exchange risk in its foreign operations this extreme volatility presented the company with unprecedented challenges in managing this risk 
the combined effect of valuation declines in both the equity and bond markets resulted in a million decline million  net of tax in the cash surrender value inherent in a series of company owned life insurance policies associated with the company sponsored deferred compensation program 
net tax benefits of million related to the reversal of valuation allowances associated with certain net operating loss carryforwards in the first quarter of as a result of these items and the above outlined items affecting operating income collectively  the unusual items  net income in was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the prior year period 
prior year net income included million of net income related to foreign tax benefits and finalization of prior year tax returns 
excluding the unusual items  net income would have been million as compared to net income of million  exclusive of the identified tax benefits 
diluted earnings per share for fiscal  inclusive of per diluted share related to the unusual items  declined to per diluted share from per diluted share in the prior year  which included a benefit of per diluted share related to foreign taxes and finalization of prior year tax returns 
excluding the effect of the unusual items  net income per diluted share would have been as compared to the per diluted share in  exclusive of the identified tax benefits 
primarily as a result of the company s share repurchases during the last year  the diluted weighted average common shares declined by during versus the corresponding prior year period which produced a favorable impact on net income per diluted share of 
the company s operating results can be affected by changes in prices of commodities  primarily copper  which are components in some of the products sold 
generally  as the costs of current inventory purchases increase due to higher commodity prices  the company s mark up percentage to customers remains relatively constant  this inflationary effect results in higher sales revenue and gross profit 
in addition  existing inventory purchased at previously lower prices and sold as prices increase results in a higher gross profit margin 
conversely  a decrease in commodity prices in a short period of time would have the opposite effect  negatively affecting financial results 
over the past three years  the company has benefited from historically high copper prices on its financial performance 
importantly  however  there is no exact measure of the effect of higher copper prices  as there are thousands of transactions in any given quarter  each of which has various factors involved in the individual pricing decisions 
market based copper prices averaged approximately per pound during per pound 
table of contents during the first three quarters of the year and during the fourth quarter of the year compared to per pound in despite the significant drop in spot market prices for copper in the fourth quarter of  for the full year  copper price fluctuations had a limited impact on product prices 
while certain products in certain markets dropped in price to reflect the lower raw material costs  for much of the market  pricing in the final months of the year continued to reflect higher priced copper content in inventory throughout the supply chain 
as the supply chain replaces it current high priced inventory with newer inventory that reflects more current lower copper prices  the deflationary effects of this will be seen more dramatically beginning in outlook as we look to  there are a number of factors that will likely lead to the company reporting lower sales and earnings than in in late  the us dollar strengthened considerably against most foreign currencies 
with approximately percent of the company s sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar it is expected that  if exchange rates stay at their comparative year end levels  then reported sales and earnings from our foreign operations will translate to lower amounts than reported in in addition  in the fourth quarter of  the average spot price of copper dropped by about percent from the average level of the first three quarters of while this drop in spot prices had little effect on fourth quarter results  it is assumed that  if the average spot price for copper remains near the year end level through  it will have deflationary effects on our reported electrical wire and cable sales  and the earnings associated with those sales  throughout the coming year 
lastly  the consensus economic forecasts are for a decline in global gross domestic product gdp in versus  but with considerable variation in opinion on how the year on year comparisons will trend by quarter 
the combination of the above factors creates considerable uncertainty about the outlook for the full year of with the level of uncertainty increasing later in the year because of a lack of visibility on these key factors 
further  significant changes in foreign exchange rates  copper prices and the gdp outlook during may either negatively or positively affect reported sales and earnings depending on the direction and degree of change in these factors 
as of the date of this filing  the near term outlook is somewhat clearer given the comparative stability of foreign exchange rates and copper prices to those seen at year end 
as such  the company expects that first quarter sales and operating income will show year on year declines that are greater than those seen in the fourth quarter year on year comparisons  exclusive of the unusual expense items reported in the fourth quarter of the greater decline in sales and operating income are anticipated to be largely due to the deflationary effects of the fourth quarter declines in copper prices being reflected in product prices beginning in the first quarter

excluding the acquisitions and the favorable effects of foreign exchange rates  the company s net sales increased million  or approximately  in as compared to the prior year 
the factors driving the company s organic growth were consistent with those the company has seen during the past couple of years

excluding the operating expenses related to the unusual items  acquisitions  the effects of foreign exchange rates and the extra rd week in fiscal  operating expenses increased approximately million  or  primarily due to variable costs associated with the organic growth in sales 
the low rate of expense growth also reflects the benefit of lower management incentive expense due to the company s earnings being less than the incentive plan targets 
core operating expenses remain very tightly controlled relative to sales growth so that the company can continue to invest in its strategic initiatives which include growing the security business  expanding the geographic presence of the electrical wire and cable business in continental europe and the middle east  developing a presence in the industrial automation market  adding to our supply chain services offering and continuing to expand business in the emerging markets

critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes that the following are critical areas of accounting that either require significant judgment by management or may be affected by changes in general market conditions outside the control of management 
as a result  changes in estimates and general market conditions could cause actual results to differ materially from future expected results 
historically  the company s estimates in these critical areas have not differed materially from actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts at january  and december   the company reported net accounts receivable of  million and  million  respectively 
each quarter the company segregates the doubtful receivable balances into the following major categories and determines the bad debt reserve required as outlined below customers that are no longer paying their balances are reserved based on the historical write off percentages  risk accounts are individually reviewed and the reserve is based on the probability of potential default 
the company continually monitors payment patterns of customers  investigates past due accounts to assess the likelihood of collection and monitors industry and economic trends to estimate required allowances  and the outstanding balance for customers who have declared bankruptcy is reserved at the estimated net realizable value 
if circumstances related to the above factors change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced increased by a material amount 
inventory obsolescence at january  and december   the company reported inventory of  million and  million  respectively 
each quarter the company reviews the excess inventory and makes an assessment of the realizable value 
there are many factors that management considers in determining whether or not or the amount by which a reserve should be established 
these factors include the following return or rotation privileges with vendors  price protection from vendors  expected future usage  whether or not a customer is obligated by contract to purchase the inventory  current market pricing  historical consumption experience  and risk of obsolescence 
if circumstances related to the above factors change  there could be a material impact on the net realizable value of the inventory 
pension expense sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
and the policies used by the company generally reduce the recognition of actuarial gains and losses in the net benefit cost  as any significant actuarial gains losses are amortized over the remaining service lives of the plan participants 
these actuarial gains and losses are mainly attributable to the return on plan assets that differ from that assumed  changes in the obligation different from that assumed due to changes in the discount rate  plan demographic changes and other assumptions 
a significant element in determining the company s net periodic benefit cost in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
in  the company assumed that the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets would be 
this expected return on plan assets is included in the net periodic benefit cost for the fiscal year ended as a result of the combined effect of valuation declines in both the equity and bond markets  the plan assets produced an actual loss of approximately in as compared to an actual return of in as a result  the fair value of plan assets declined to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal when the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is significant  the difference is amortized into expense over the service lives of the plan participants 
these amounts are reflected on the balance sheet through charges to other comprehensive income 

table of contents the measurement date for all plans of the company is december st 
accordingly  at the end of each fiscal year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount the plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate at the end of and  the company reviewed rates of return on relevant market indices  specifically  the citigroup pension liability index 
these rates are adjusted to match the duration of the liabilities associated with the pension plans 
at january  and december   the company determined the consolidated weighted average rate of all plans to be and  respectively  and used this rate to measure the projected benefit obligation at the end of each respective fiscal year end 
as a result of the change in the discount rate as well as changes in foreign exchange rates  the projected benefit obligation declined to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal as a result of the change in asset values and the projected benefit obligation  the company s consolidated net pension liability was million at the end of  up from million at the end of based on the consolidated weighted average discount rate at the beginning of and and  respectively  the company recognized a consolidated pre tax net periodic cost of million in  down slightly from million in the company estimates its net periodic cost to increase by approximately due to the large difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets which will result in additional amortization of actuarial gains and losses in due to its long duration  the pension liability is very sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a basis point decline in the assumed discount rate would result in an increase in the pension expense of approximately million and an increase in the projected benefit obligations at january  of million 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis and in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 the company tests for goodwill impairment annually using a two step process  unless there is a triggering event  in which case a test would be performed at the time that such triggering event occurs 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
for all periods presented  the company s reporting units are consistent with its operating segments 
the estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires the company to make various judgmental assumptions  including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the forecast and long term business plans of each operating segment 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units 
if necessary  the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the company s goodwill impairment analysis is performed annually at the beginning of the third quarter 
however  as a result of the dramatic change in the economic and market conditions in the fourth quarter of  including the change in the company s stock price as compared to the company s book value per share as well as the significant disruptions in the global credit markets  the company performed an interim impairment test as of fiscal year end the company s annual and interim impairment tests did not result in an impairment charge for goodwill 
however  if market conditions deteriorate further from current conditions during  in particular  if the company s share price is below or approximates its book value per share  or if other conditions cause a significant change in any one reporting unit s fair value  the company may need to reassess goodwill impairment at a period other than its annual impairment test 
subsequent reviews of goodwill could result in a non cash impairment charge related to goodwill during as of january   the company does not have any material indefinite lived intangible assets subject to the provisions of sfas no 
our intangible assets include definite lived intangibles which are primarily related to customer relationships 
the impairment test for these intangible assets is conducted when impairment indicators are present 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its intangible assets warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable 

table of contents deferred tax assets the company maintains valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances are included in the company s tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
the reliability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future  particularly if earnings of a particular subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected  or if management takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 
reserves for uncertain tax positions in the normal course of business  the company is audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
management believes the company s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions  based upon the technical support for the positions  the company s past audit experience with similar situations and potential interest and penalties related to the matters 
management believes these reserves represent the best estimate of the amount that the company will ultimately be required to pay to settle the matters 
the company s effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if  upon final resolution with taxing authorities  the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established  or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
as of january   the aggregate amount of global income tax reserves and related interest recorded in current taxes payable was approximately million 
these reserves cover a wide range of issues and involve numerous different taxing jurisdictions 
the single largest item million relates to a dispute with the state of wisconsin concerning income taxes payable upon the sale of a short line railroad that operated solely within such state 
other significant exposures for which reserves exist include  but are not limited to  a variety of foreign jurisdictional transfer pricing disputes and foreign withholding tax issues related to inter company transfers and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rate changes  as well as changes in the market value of its financial instruments 
the company periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
the company s strategy is to negotiate terms for its derivatives and other financial instruments to be perfectly effective  such that the change in the value of the derivative perfectly offsets the impact of the underlying hedged item 
the company s counterparties to its derivative contracts have investment grade or above credit ratings 
the company expects the credit worthiness of its counterparties to remain intact through the term of the transactions 
the company regularly monitors the credit worthiness of its counterparties to ensure no issues exist which could affect the value of the derivatives 
any resulting gains or losses from hedge ineffectiveness are reflected directly in income 
during periods of volatile changes in foreign exchange rates  the company can be subject to significant foreign exchange gains and losses since there is a time lag between when the company incurs the foreign exchange exposure and when the company has the information to properly hedge the exposure 
the company s foreign currency denominated sales were in and and in the company s exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relate to canada canadian dollar and europe euro and british pound 
the company also has exposure to currency rate fluctuations related to more volatile markets such as argentina peso  australia dollar  brazil real  chile peso  colombia peso  mexico peso  and venezuela bolivar 
the company s investments in several subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the us dollar 
as these foreign currency denominated investments are translated at the end of each period during consolidation  fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the us dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments 
these fluctuations and the results of operations for foreign subsidiaries  where the functional currency is not the us dollar  are translated into us dollars using the average exchange rates during the year  
table of contents while the assets and liabilities are translated using period end exchange rates 
the related translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity  foreign currency translation  which is a component of other comprehensive income 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
borrowings are raised in certain foreign currencies to minimize the exchange rate fluctuation risk 
as of january  and december   the company had a significant amount of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity 
the absolute value of these assets and liabilities at january  and december   was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company has purchased short term foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies 
at january  and december   the notional amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of these contracts are recorded as an asset of million and a liability of million at january  and december   respectively 
as of january  and december   the company utilized interest rate agreements that effectively fix or cap  for a period of time  the gbp london interbank offered rate gbp libor  the eur interbank offered rate eur ibor and the bankers acceptance canadian dollar offered rate ba cdor components of the interest rates on a portion of its floating rate obligations denominated in those currencies 
at january   the company had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a notional amount of gbp million  euro million two euro million agreements and million canadian dollars 
at december   the company had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a notional amount of gbp million  euro million and million canadian dollars 
the gbp libor swap agreements obligate the company to pay a fixed rate of approximately through july the ba cdor swap agreement obligates the company to pay a fixed rate of approximately through december and the eur ibor swap agreements obligate the company to pay a fixed rate of approximately and through july and november  respectively 
as of january  and december   as a result of these agreements along with fixed rate borrowing agreements  the interest rate on approximately and of debt obligations  respectively  was fixed 
the fair market value of outstanding interest rate agreements  which is the estimated amount that the company would pay to transfer the interest rate agreements ie  exit price  was million and million at january  and december   respectively 
the impact of interest rate agreements to interest expense was minimal in  and the company does not enter into interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its derivatives and other financial instruments assuming a adverse change in interest rates and a adverse change in the foreign currency contracts outstanding 
holding all other variables constant  the hypothetical adverse changes would have increased interest expense by million and million in and  respectively  and decreased the value of foreign currency forward contracts by million and million in and  respectively 
if there were a percent adverse change in the exchange rates  the company would record a foreign exchange loss of approximately million 
the company s fixed rate debt primarily consists of the senior notes and convertible debt instruments specifically  the notes due and notes due 
the combined estimated fair market value of the company s outstanding fixed rate debt senior notes and convertible debt at january  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the fair market value is due to the decrease in the company s stock price during the company s notes due bear interest at a fixed rate of 
therefore  changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the notes due but interest rates do affect the fair value 
if interest rates were to increase by  the fair market value of the notes due would decrease by and for and  respectively 
if interest rates were to decrease by  the fair market value of the fixed rate debt would increase by and for and  respectively 
as of january  and december   the fair value of the fixed rate debt instruments was million and million  respectively 
the company has outstanding debt that may be converted into the company s common stock 
accordingly  the price of its common stock may affect the fair value of the company s convertible debt 
the estimated fair value of the company s outstanding convertible debt decreased to million at january  from million at december  due to the decrease in the company s stock price during a hypothetical decrease 
table of contents in the price of the company s common stock from the price at january  and december  would have reduced the fair value of its then outstanding convertible debt by million and million  respectively 
changes in the market value of the company s debt do not affect the reported results of operations unless the company is retiring such obligations prior to their maturity 
this analysis did not consider the effects of a changed level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment and certain other factors 
further  in the event of a change of this magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to possible changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
