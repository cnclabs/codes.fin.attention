risk factors in this annual report 
business overview trends and economic environment we believe that the poor economy  high unemployment  tight credit markets  and heightened uncertainty in financial markets during the past two years have adversely impacted discretionary consumer spending  including spending on the types of electronic devices that are accessorized by our products 
in response to the economic recession certain of our major diabetic case customers have significantly reduced their sales forecasts to us for blood glucose diagnostic kits  with which our products are packaged in box  therefore implying reduced sales revenues from these customers in future periods 
we expect this challenging business environment to continue in the near term 
our response to current conditions has been to cut operating expenses and reduce headcount  and we have attempted to limit increases in operating expenses except where we think increases are critical to potential future growth 
in response to increasing customer and sales concentration  we have focused marketing efforts on expanding our customer base 
these efforts are meeting with some preliminary success  although the degree of success will not become apparent until we are deeper into fiscal we have received small  initial orders from first time customers 
the key question in fiscal will be whether our overall net sales and net profit will primarily reflect revenue contribution from new customers or the decline in revenues from existing customers that have indicated reduced order flow in fiscal see part i  item ia 
of this annual report  risk factors  including we have announced our intention to diversify our business by means of acquisition or other business combination 
variability of revenues and results of operation because a high percentage of our sales revenues is highly concentrated in a few large customers  and because the volumes of these customers order flows to us are highly variable  with short lead times  our quarterly revenues  and consequently our results of operations  are susceptible to significant variability over a relatively short period of time 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the accounting policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment of a particular transaction 
in other cases  management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion of the applications of these and other accounting policies  refer to
