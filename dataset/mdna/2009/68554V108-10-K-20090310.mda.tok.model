the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained herein and the notes thereto  along with the section entitled critical accounting policies and estimates  set forth below 
overview we operate primarily in the in vitro diagnostic business 
our business principally involves the development  manufacture  marketing and sale of oral fluid diagnostic products and specimen collection devices using our proprietary oral fluid technologies  as well as other diagnostic products including immunoassays and other in vitro diagnostic tests that are used on other specimen types  and other medical devices used for the removal of warts and other benign skin lesions by cryosurgery  or freezing 
our diagnostic products include tests which are performed on a rapid basis at the point of care and tests which are processed in a laboratory 
these products are sold in the united states and internationally to various clinical laboratories  hospitals  clinics  community based organizations and other public health organizations  distributors  government agencies  physicians offices  and commercial and industrial entities 
one of our products has been sold in the otc or consumer retail market in the united states  canada  europe  mexico and australia 
in vitro diagnostic testing is the process of analyzing oral fluid  blood  urine and other bodily fluids or tissue for the presence of specific substances or markers for infectious diseases  drugs of abuse or other conditions 
however  we have targeted the use of oral fluid in our products as a differentiating factor and believe that it provides a significant competitive advantage over blood and urine 
our oral fluid tests have sensitivity and specificity comparable to blood and or urine tests 
in vitro diagnostic tests are performed outside the body  in contrast to in vivo tests  which are performed directly on or within the body 
when combined with their ease of use  non invasive and dignified nature  and cost effectiveness  our oral fluid tests represent a very competitive alternative to the more traditional testing methods in the diagnostic space 
during the year ended december   our total revenues were million  which represents a decrease from the million we reported in we recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december   which includes a non cash charge of million in our income tax provision for the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
this compares to net income of million for the year ended december  during  we continued to invest in our research and development efforts to obtain fda approval to sell our oraquick hiv test over the counter  to develop our rapid hcv test and to develop homogeneous fully automated drugs of abuse assays for use with our intercept oral fluid collection device in collaboration with roche diagnostics 
as a result  research and development expenses increased million in compared to the prior year 
our liquidity position remains strong  as we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  revenues from the infectious disease testing market continued to grow in as result of sales of our oraquick advance hiv test 
sales to public health benefited from the growth in our base business and from the incremental sales driven by the cdc s efforts to increase hiv testing 
we terminated our distribution agreement with abbott for the sale of oraquick advance at the end of as a result of our decision to sell oraquick advance directly to us hospitals and reference laboratories 
table of contents starting on january  sales to abbott decreased in as a direct result of the reduction of abbott purchases in the latter months of in anticipation of the agreement termination at year end and increased competition in the hospital market 
under our former distribution agreement  abbott was our exclusive distributor in the us hospital market and a non exclusive distributor in the us physicians office marketplace 
competition in the market for hiv testing is intense and is expected to increase 
we believe that the principal competition will come from existing laboratory based blood tests  point of care rapid blood tests  laboratory based urine assays or other oral fluid based tests that may be developed 
our competitors include specialized biotechnology firms  as well as pharmaceutical companies with biotechnology divisions and medical diagnostic companies 
revenues from our cryosurgical products decreased significantly in  primarily due to the absence of sales in the us otc market  reduced sales in certain european and mexican otc markets  and a decrease in product sales in the domestic professional market 
the cryosurgical systems market is comprised of histofreezer sales into both the domestic and international physicians office markets and sales of our otc product formulation to our international distributors  ssl and genomma labs 
ssl distributes our wart removal product under its scholl s and dr 
scholl trademarks in the otc footcare market in several european countries 
genomma labs has distribution rights to a similar product in the otc footcare market in mexico  argentina  brazil  and various other central and south american countries 
genomma labs reduced its purchasing levels in  in response to an increase in product returns from retailers due to overstocking during the winter months of sales to ssl declined due to lower revenues experienced by ssl in key markets outside of the united kingdom 
the absence of us otc sales in resulted from the termination of our domestic distribution relationship with prestige brands at the end of as a result  we have developed our own proprietary nationally branded wart removal product which we started selling in the us otc market in early it is not possible to predict at this time how well the new branded product will perform 
our combined cryosurgical sales to physician offices also experienced a decline in as the business was negatively impacted by the diversion of some lower priced histofreezer product from international sources back into the us professional market 
we addressed this diversion issue by increasing our international pricing  changing product labeling and packaging  and enforcing contractual rights against certain international distributors 
we believe this diversion issue was largely confined to  and we do not expect it to have a material impact on revenues 
revenues from the substance abuse testing market decreased in as sales of our intercept drug testing system were directly impacted by the decline in pre employment testing in domestic markets 
pre employment drug screening represents approximately of our workplace drug testing business 
as a result of the decline in the us economy  the related decrease in hiring has had a direct impact on this segment of our business 
because of the regulatory approvals needed for most of our products  we often are required to rely on sole source providers for critical components and materials and on related products supplied by third parties 
this is particularly true for our oraquick advance test  our orasure oral fluid collection device and our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory product 
if we are unable to obtain necessary components or materials from these sole sources  the time required to develop replacements and obtain the required fda approvals could disrupt our ability to sell the affected products 
in past years  bmx manufactured and sold the only oral fluid hiv screening test that had received fda approval for use in detecting hiv in an oral fluid specimen collected with our orasure collection device 
bmx also supplied the hiv antigen used to manufacture our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory test and was the exclusive world wide distributor of that product 
bmx discontinued manufacturing their hiv eia screening test during as a result  we intend to seek fda approval of an alternative hiv eia screening 
table of contents test for use with our orasure collection device 
bmx also elected not to renew our western blot agreements beyond december   and we are now selling the western blot oral fluid hiv confirmatory test directly to our laboratory customers 
we also rely heavily on distributors to purchase and resell many of our products 
for example  ssl has exclusive rights to our wart removal product in the otc footcare market in europe  australia and new zealand 
we granted genomma labs exclusive rights to distribute our wart removal product in the otc market in mexico  argentina  brazil  and various other central and south american countries 
we have contracted with several distributors to sell our oraquick advance hiv test to the us physician office market and our intercept and orasure product lines are sold by several laboratory distributors 
we expect to enter into additional distribution agreements for new and future products  for distribution in the us and internationally 
if our distributors are unable or unwilling to meet the minimum purchase commitments set forth in their agreements or otherwise substantially reduce the volume of their purchases  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we generated of our revenues in the us marketplace compared to in we are continuously evaluating strategies to increase our sales penetration in markets outside the us as our business in foreign countries increases  we could be exposed to other economic  political  exchange rate  regulatory and cultural risks 
the current economic downturn  including disruptions in the capital and credit markets  may continue indefinitely and intensify  and could adversely affect our financial performance and condition or those of our customers and suppliers 
these circumstances could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed to conduct or expand our business or conduct acquisitions or make other discretionary investments 
these circumstances may also adversely impact the capital needs of our customers and suppliers  which  in turn  could adversely affect their ability to purchase our products or supply us with necessary equipment  raw materials or components 
results of operations year ended december  compared to december  total revenues decreased to million in from million in increased sales in both the infectious disease and insurance risk assessment markets  together with an increase in licensing and product development revenues  were more than offset by declines in sales of our cryosurgical wart removal and substance abuse testing products 
revenues derived from products sold to customers outside the united states were million and million or and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of our international sales are transactions in us dollars 
as such  the impact of foreign currencies has not been material to our operating results 
the table below shows the amount of our total revenues in thousands  except generated in each of our principal markets and by licensing and product development activities 
year ended december  dollars change percentage of total revenues market infectious disease testing substance abuse testing cryosurgical systems insurance risk assessment product revenues licensing and product development total revenues 
table of contents sales to the infectious disease testing market increased to million in  primarily as a result of the continued strong performance of our oraquick advance rapid hiv antibody test in an increasingly competitive environment 
oraquick and orasure sales during totaled million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million in  respectively 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total oraquick revenues in thousands  except during and year ended december  change customers direct to us public health abbott international samhsa cdc total oraquick revenues during  oraquick revenue derived from direct sales to the us public health market increased by as compared to this increase is the result of continued growth in our base business and from incremental sales driven by the cdc s efforts to increase hiv testing 
in september  the cdc awarded incremental funding to expand hiv testing and prevention programs in populations disproportionately affected by hiv  primarily african americans 
these funds were allocated to targeted state and public health agencies  for utilization during for the year ended december   sales to our former hospital distributor  abbott  decreased to million  as compared to million in this decrease was largely the result of abbott s ordering patterns  the impact of negotiations to end our distribution agreement at the end of  and increased competition in the hospital market 
as previously discussed  commencing in  we began selling our oraquick advance rapid hiv antibody test directly into the us hospital market 
revenues derived from the cdc and samhsa declined significantly in when compared to in  the cdc and samhsa placed bulk purchase orders directly with the company for oraquick advance devices and related testing materials  for further distribution to various public health entities 
however  both the cdc and samhsa did not place new bulk orders in and are not currently engaging in bulk procurement and distribution activities 
as such  it is not expected that comparable sized bulk purchase orders from these governmental entities or others will be received in the future 
we believe that our oraquick advance device  which is fda approved for detecting antibodies to both hiv and hiv in oral fluid  finger stick and venous whole blood  and plasma samples  and is clia waived for use with all sample types except plasma  provides a significant competitive advantage  thereby enabling us to fully implement a strategy for selling oraquick in the us and internationally 
we received ce mark approval for our oraquick advance test and we currently sell small quantities of this product in europe 
we have established distribution channels in several european countries and are pursuing other distributors elsewhere in the european union and in other countries 
international sales of our oraquick test remained relatively flat at million in both and  with sales in africa contributing and million of those revenues in and  respectively 
we have continued to see evidence that sales of oraquick advance are negatively impacting sales of our orasure oral fluid collection device in the infectious disease testing market in the us during  our sales of orasure declined  from million in to million in some customers who have purchased our orasure device for laboratory hiv testing in the past are now electing to purchase our 
table of contents oraquick advance test 
we believe this is the result of customers recognizing the benefits of rapid hiv testing  especially with oral fluid  and the cdc s efforts to increase rapid hiv testing in healthcare settings 
while it is not possible at this time to estimate the extent of such ongoing change in purchasing patterns  we expect the decline in orasure sales to continue 
sales to the substance abuse testing market decreased in as the use of our intercept device for workplace testing was impacted by the continuing adverse economic conditions 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total intercept revenues in thousands  except generated in each market during and year ended december  change market workplace testing criminal justice international direct total intercept revenues our workplace testing business decreased from million in to million in pre employment drug screening represents approximately of our workplace testing business and the current decline in the domestic economy and rising unemployment has had a direct impact on this segment of our business 
accordingly  we do not expect renewed growth in our intercept business until employment conditions in the us improve 
in addition  the microplate oral fluid drug assays  which are sold for use with the intercept collection device  are expected to come under increasing competitive pressure in the future from home brew assays developed internally by our laboratory customers 
our oral fluid microplate assays also compete with urine based homogeneous assays that are run on fully automated  random access analyzers 
we believe our competitors are developing oral fluid tests suitable for use on these fully automated homogeneous assay systems and these assays  if and when they are developed and commercialized  could represent a significant competitive threat to our oral fluid microplate business 
in order to meet this competition  we are jointly developing and intend to commercialize fully automated homogeneous oral fluid drugs of abuse assays with roche diagnostics for use with our intercept device 
sales of our products in the cryosurgical systems market which includes both the physicians office and otc markets decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily the result of a significant decline in sales of our domestic and international otc cryosurgical products when compared to the table below shows a breakdown of our total cryosurgery revenues in thousands  except generated in each market during and year ended december  change market professional domestic professional international otc domestic otc international total cryosurgical systems revenues 
table of contents our domestic otc cryosurgical product was previously distributed in the united states and canada by prestige  owner of the compound w line of wart removal products 
our distribution agreement with prestige terminated on december   and as a result  no sales were made to prestige in or will be made in the future to this distributor 
sales to prestige were million in in  we developed our own proprietary nationally branded wart removal product and began selling this product in the us otc market in early it is not possible to predict at this time how successful our new brand will be in the domestic otc marketplace 
we have an agreement with ssl under which we manufacture and supply  and ssl distributes on an exclusive basis  our cryosurgical wart removal product in the otc footcare market in europe  australia and new zealand 
the product is manufactured and sold under ssl s scholl and dr 
scholl trademarks 
sales to ssl were million and million in and  respectively 
the million sales decline in the current year is due to lower than expected outsales by ssl in key markets outside of the united kingdom  primarily resulting from intense competition from an already existing brand and new market entrants 
we have granted genomma labs exclusive distribution rights to our cryosurgical wart removal product in the otc markets in mexico  argentina  brazil  and various other central and south american countries 
sales to genomma labs were approximately  in and million in during  genomma labs reduced its purchases from us  in response to an increase in product returns from retailers in mexico who overstocked during the winter months of throughout  genomma worked to reduce its excess inventory position  and accordingly did not purchase additional product from us 
we believe these markets represent potential future sales opportunities for our cryosurgical products  however  the full realization of such sales will take time 
sales of our histofreezer product to physicians offices in the united states decreased to million in  as compared to million in sales of histofreezer in the international market increased to million from million in on a combined basis  however  cryosurgical sales in the professional market declined in  as this business was affected by the diversion of some lower priced histofreezer product from international sources into the us professional market 
the selling prices for our histofreezer product are lower in some foreign countries due to differences in the healthcare systems in those countries 
during  some distributors in these countries purchased english labeled histofreezer product and resold it into the domestic distribution network to distributors who employ alternate sourcing programs 
we aggressively addressed this diversion issue by increasing our international pricing  changing product labeling and packaging  and enforcing contractual rights against certain international distributors 
we believe this diversion issue was largely confined to and we do not expect it to have a material impact on revenues 
we are beginning to see some evidence that sales of our otc cryosurgical products may reduce the number of individuals that will seek to obtain treatment of their warts by a physician  which in turn could negatively affect sales of our histofreezer product in the professional market 
it is not possible at this time to estimate the extent of the financial impact of this change 
sales to the insurance risk assessment market increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of an increase in revenues associated with our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory test 
bmx discontinued the distribution of our western blot hiv confirmatory test and  as a result  we are now selling this product directly to our laboratory customers 
overall  we expect our revenues in this market will remain at levels comparable to those attained in licensing and product development revenues increased to million in  from million in in january  we entered into a license and settlement agreement with schering plough in which they agreed to pay us royalties on sales of their freeze away tm product 
pursuant to the terms of that licensing agreement  during  we recorded million in royalty payments from schering plough 
in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with schering plough corporation  for the development and promotion of a rapid oral fluid test for the detection of antibodies to hcv 
during  we recognized million in revenues associated with funded research and development under this agreement 

table of contents the company s gross margin was in  compared to in our gross margin was negatively impacted by the significant decline in higher margin cryosurgical sales and by increases in manufacturing scrap and spoilage expense 
scrap expense increased from million in to million in although scrap and spoilage expense exceeded levels  oraquick scrap and spoilage was down sequentially in each quarter of  as we identified its root cause and made the appropriate adjustments 
we expect overall oraquick scrap and spoilage expense to be significantly lower in when compared to  primarily due to the oraquick product and manufacturing process enhancements and twelve month shelf life recently approved by the fda 
research and development expenses increased to million in  from million in  primarily as a result of increased product and clinical development costs for our oraquick hcv test  costs associated with our continued efforts to obtain fda approval to sell our oraquick hiv test over the counter  and costs to develop our homogeneous fully automated drugs of abuse assays for use with our intercept oral fluid collection device in collaboration with roche diagnostics 
also included in the current year expense is a million patent license milestone payment required as a result of our filing of a premarket approval application with the fda for our oraquick hcv device 
we believe the majority of the product development and clinical trial costs associated with the oraquick hcv device have already been incurred 
as such  we expect our research and development costs to decrease in sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily the result of incremental salaries  benefits  and recruiting and relocation expenses related to hiring additional direct sales personnel for the hospital market  as we prepared to assume control of this distribution channel from abbott in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in distributor advertising and promotional costs 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to remain at approximately the level 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower cash and stock compensation costs  bank charges  consulting fees and legal expenses 
in  we expect general and administrative costs to increase slightly due to increased staffing costs and legal expenses associated with the patent infringement lawsuit filed against us by inverness medical and church dwight 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in  as a result of lower outstanding debt balances and our election to fix the interest rate on our primary facilities advance at until its maturity in june interest income decreased to million in from million in primarily as a result of lower yields earned on our investment portfolio  usage of some previously invested cash to fund inventory purchases  capital expenditures  and the stock repurchase program initiated during  and an overall conservative  shorter term investment approach 
as a result of the license and settlement agreement we entered into with schering plough to resolve our patent infringement litigation  we received a payment of million during the first quarter of  which was recorded as other income 
in january  we sold our ownership interest in a privately held nonaffiliated company and recorded a million pre tax gain on the sale of this investment 
we purchase some of our cryosurgical products from  or utilize the services of  vendors located in the netherlands 
as a result of the weakness of the united states dollar in relation to the euro  we recorded a net loss on foreign currency transactions in the amount of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we recorded a million net federal and state tax benefit associated with the pretax loss of million for that same period 
in the fourth quarter of  however  as global economic conditions worsened  we also re evaluated whether or not we would realize the benefits associated with our total net deferred tax asset in the future 
given the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and length of the current economic recession  our loss in  and our projection of a loss in  we determined that it is more likely 
table of contents than not that we will not realize the benefits associated with our net deferred tax assets in the immediate future 
accordingly  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes  we recorded an income tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of in order to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
during  we recorded provisions for federal and state income taxes of million  which reflect a effective tax rate 
our effective rate reflects the impact of permanent differences  generated by items which are not deductible on our income tax returns 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an income tax benefit of  related to the inclusion of a federal research and development tax credit 
year ended december  compared to december  total revenues increased by to million in from million in  primarily as a result of increased sales of our oraquick advance rapid hiv antibody test and our otc cryosurgical products  together with an increase in funded research and development related to our oraquick rapid hcv test

in september  prestige announced that it had acquired the wartner cryosurgical wart removal product line  which directly competed with the freeze off product in the otc market 
our distribution agreement with prestige contained a covenant not to compete which precluded prestige from acquiring  manufacturing  distributing or selling a cryosurgical product that directly competed with the freeze off product 
we notified prestige that its acquisition of the wartner product constituted a material breach of the distribution agreement and that certain of its other actions constituted additional breaches under the agreement 
efforts to resolve this matter through mediation were not successful and arbitration commenced 
our distribution agreement with prestige terminated on december  as a result of the arbitration proceeding

sales to genomma under this new distribution agreement were approximately million in sales of our histofreezer product to physicians offices in the united states decreased to million in  as compared to million in sales of histofreezer in the international market remained relatively flat at million 
sales to the insurance risk assessment market declined by to million in from million in  primarily because of a reduction in the number of applications for life insurance and changes in underwriting requirements 
for higher face value policies  it appears insurance companies are more likely to use a blood test for multiple risk factors  rather than an oral fluid test 
licensing and product development revenues increased to million in  from  in in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with schering plough  for the development and promotion of a rapid oral fluid test for the detection of antibodies to hcv

net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december primarily as a result of the purchase of  shares of common stock  at an aggregate cost of million  under our stock repurchase plan which was approved by our board of directors on august   partially offset by  received from the exercise of stock options 
additional uses of cash for financing activities were  in loan principal repayments and  used for the purchase and retirement of common stock 
at december   we had in place a  credit facility the credit facility with comerica bank comerica which is comprised of a  facilities advance and a  revolving working capital line of credit 
at our option  interest on the facilities advance is payable monthly at either a fixed rate equal to the five year us treasury note rate plus to  or a variable rate equal to the   or day libor plus to 
in each case  the interest rate is determined at the date of the advance and is based upon the amount of cash and cash equivalents we invest and retain at comerica securities  inc we also can choose the fixed rate option  without penalty  at the expiration of a previously elected libor period 
principal is repayable in periodic installments  based upon the rate option that we elect  with the remaining balance of unpaid principal due on june  interest on any advances under the revolving working capital line of credit is payable at either the us prime rate less or day libor pus  in each case determined at the time of funding 
in january  we elected to fix the interest rate on the facilities advance at until its maturity  with principal and interest payable on a monthly basis 
as of december   we had  in outstanding borrowings under the facilities advance and no outstanding borrowings under the  revolving working capital line of credit  which has a maturity date of june  all borrowings under the credit facility are collateralized by a first priority security interest in all of our assets  including present and future accounts receivable  chattel paper  contracts and contract rights  equipment and accessories  general intangibles  investments  instruments  inventories  and a mortgage on our three facilities in bethlehem  pennsylvania 
borrowings under the revolving working capital line of credit are limited to commercially standard percentages of accounts receivable 
the credit facility contains certain covenants that set forth minimum requirements for our quick ratio  liquidity  and tangible net worth 
we were in full compliance with all covenants at december  the credit facility also restricts our ability to pay dividends  to make certain investments  to incur additional indebtedness  to sell or otherwise dispose of a substantial portion of assets  and to merge or consolidate operations with an unaffiliated entity  without the consent of comerica 
at december   we had nol carryforwards of million for federal income tax purposes 
during the fourth quarter of  the company retained independent tax specialists to perform an ownership change study and analysis to determine the annual limitation amount applicable to utilization of the nol carryforwards due to past ownership changes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
we continue to review ownership changes on an annual basis 
we do not believe that ownership change limitations would impair our ability to utilize our nols against taxable income that we may generate in the future 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset generated by these nols 
establishment of this valuation allowance does not change our view of the company s long term financial outlook or the expected utilization of our nol carryforwards 
the combination of our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and available borrowings under our credit facility  is expected to be more than sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs through 
table of contents our cash requirements  however  may vary materially from those now planned due to many factors  including  but not limited to  the scope and timing of strategic acquisitions  the cost and timing of the expansion of our manufacturing capacity  the progress of our research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical testing  the magnitude of capital expenditures  changes in existing and potential relationships with business partners  the time and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents  proprietary rights and any necessary licenses  the cost and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of market launch of new products  market acceptance of new products  competing technological and market developments and other factors

off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our judgments and estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue recognition  clinical trial accruals  contingencies and litigation 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other 
table of contents factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we consider the following accounting estimates  which have been discussed with our audit committee  to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition 
we follow sab no 
 revenue recognition 
this bulletin draws on existing accounting rules and provides specific guidance on revenue recognition for up front non refundable licensing and development fees 
we license certain products or technology to outside third parties  in return for which we receive up front licensing fees 
some of these fees can be significant 
in accordance with sab no 
 we recognize this revenue ratably over the related license period 
we also enter into research and development contracts with corporate  government and or private entities 
these contracts generally provide for payments to us upon achievement of certain research or development milestones 
product development revenues from these contracts are recognized only if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the customer and payment from the customer is probable 
any amounts received prior to the performance of product development efforts are recorded as deferred revenues 
recognition of revenue under these contracts can be sporadic  as it is the result of achieving specific research and development milestones 
furthermore  revenue from future milestone payments will not be recognized if the underlying research and development milestones are not achieved 
we recognize product revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has passed and collection is reasonably assured 
product revenues are net of allowances for any discounts or rebates 
we do not grant price protection or product return rights to our customers  except for warranty returns 
where a product fails to comply with its limited warranty  we can either replace the product or provide the customer with a refund of the purchase price or credit against future purchases 
historically  returns arising from warranty issues have been infrequent and immaterial 
accordingly  we expense warranty returns as incurred 
while such returns have been immaterial in the past  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same rate of warranty claims as we have in the past 
royalty income from the grant of license rights is recognized during the period in which the revenue is earned and the amount is determinable from the licensee 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are reduced by an estimated allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
on an ongoing basis  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon the customer s payment history and creditworthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we also continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that are identified  we use our judgment to establish and evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for estimated credit losses  which was  at december  while credit losses have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  these losses can vary from period to period   and  in  and  respectively 
furthermore  there is no assurance that we will experience credit losses at the same rates as we have in the past 
the current economic downturn  including disruptions in the capital and credit markets  may continue indefinitely and intensify  and could adversely affect the operations  cash flows and financial condition of our customers 
these circumstances may adversely impact the liquidity or financial position of our customers and could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and future operating results 

table of contents inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on a first in  first out basis  and include the cost of raw materials  labor and overhead 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we continually evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when  in the opinion of management  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  either a reserve is established against the inventories carrying value or the inventories are completely written off 
we base these decisions on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements over the next twelve months and the expiration dates of raw materials and finished goods 
during  and  we wrote off inventory which had a cost of million   and  respectively  as a result of scrap and product expiration issues 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the carrying value of our inventories and reported operating results 
stock based compensation 
we follow sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires us to recognize the fair value of equity based awards as compensation expense in our statement of operations 
the fair value of our stock option awards was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this valuation model s computations incorporate highly subjective assumptions  such as the expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award 
the fair value of awards  after considering the effect of expected forfeitures  is then amortized  generally on a straight line basis  over the related vesting period of the award 
long lived and intangible assets 
our long lived assets are comprised of property and equipment and our intangible assets primarily consist of patents and product rights 
together  these assets had a net book value of million  or of our total assets  at december  property and equipment and patents and product rights are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which we determine based upon our estimate of the period of time over which each asset will generate revenues 
in august  we recorded a million intangible asset related to a payment under a license agreement to certain patents related to the hepatitis c virus or hcv 
we recorded an additional million related to this license in management s intent in executing this license was to provide for various alternatives for use  including uses in the international market that would not require additional research and development efforts or regulatory approvals 
this million asset was capitalized based on management s estimate of the cash flows to be received from future product sales in these international markets 
no sales of hcv products had been made in the international markets as of december  a similar analysis of estimated future cash flows will be prepared upon payment of additional license fees under this agreement  or upon changes in circumstances  to determine the appropriate accounting treatment for payments under this license agreement 
an impairment of long lived or intangible assets could occur whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger asset impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of an asset or in our overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and shortening of product life cycles or changes in technology 
if we believe impairment of an asset has occurred  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the net book value of the affected assets to the fair value of these assets  which is generally determined based upon the present value of the expected cash flows associated with the use of these assets 
if the net book value exceeds the fair value of the impaired assets  we would incur an impairment expense equal to this difference 
we currently believe the future cash flows to be received from all long lived and intangible assets will exceed their book value and  as such  we have not recognized any impairment losses for the years ended december   and any unanticipated significant impairment in the future  however  could have a material adverse impact to our balance sheet and future operating results 
deferred tax assets 
at december   we had federal nol carryforwards of million 
the net deferred tax asset associated with these nols and other temporary differences was million at december  in assessing the realizability of net deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those 
table of contents temporary differences become deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated our ability to realize our net deferred tax asset  in order to determine if a valuation allowance should be recorded against it 
according to sfas no 
 a cumulative loss in recent years is significant piece of negative evidence to be considered when evaluating the need for a valuation allowance and this evidence is difficult to overcome 
given the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and length of the current economic recession  our loss in  and our projection of a loss in  we determined that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits associated with our net deferred tax asset in the immediate future 
accordingly  in accordance with sfas  we recorded an income tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of in order to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
our ability to use our nol carryforwards to offset future federal income tax obligations could be limited by changes in the ownership of our stock 
internal revenue code irc section contains provisions that limit the amount of federal nol carryforwards that can be used in any given year in the event of specified occurrences  including significant ownership changes 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed an analysis  with the assistance of independent tax specialists  to determine if any irc section ownership changes had occurred that would limit the amount of nols that could be utilized to offset future taxable income 
as a result of this analysis  the company concluded that prior period ownership changes may impose a limitation on the amount of nols that can be utilized in a given year 
the company does not believe  however  that this limitation will impair our future ability to utilize nols to offset our future taxable income 
the company continues to review ownership changes on an annual basis 
clinical trial accruals 
some of our research and development is conducted by third parties  including contract research and development service providers 
all such costs are charged to research and development expense systematically as incurred  which may be measured by patient enrollment or the passage of time 
at the end of each quarter  we compare the payments made to each service provider to the estimated progress toward completion of the research or development objectives 
such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
depending on the timing of payments to the service providers and the estimated service provided  we record net prepaid or accrued expense relating to these costs 
contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into various contractual relationships with strategic corporate partners  customers  distributors  research laboratories and universities  licensors  licensees  suppliers  vendors and other parties 
as such  we could be subject to litigation  claims or assessments arising from any or all of these relationships 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires that we use our best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not hold any amounts of derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and  accordingly  we have no material derivative risk to report under this item 
a significant portion of our assets is comprised of certificates of deposit  commercial paper  us government and agency obligations  and us corporate bonds 
all such instruments are classified as 
table of contents available for sale securities 
the primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal while maximizing the related income without significantly increasing risk 
even so  some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
market risk is the risk that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of an investment to fluctuate 
as interest rates increase  the fair value of a debt instrument would be expected to decrease 
correspondingly  if interest rates decrease the fair value of a debt instrument would be expected to increase 
to minimize market risk  we have the ability to hold such debt instruments to maturity  at which time the debt instrument would be redeemed at its stated or face value 
to further mitigate market risk  we also typically invest in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum 
as such  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to market risk 
in january we elected to fix the interest rate at on our long term debt until the debt s maturity in june as a result  we have no exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december   we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts or purchase currency options to hedge local currency cash flows 
we have operations in europe and africa  which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of revenues and expenses for these operations from foreign currencies to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
sales denominated in a foreign currency represented approximately  of our total revenues for the year ended december  we do not expect the risk of foreign currency fluctuations to be material in the near future
