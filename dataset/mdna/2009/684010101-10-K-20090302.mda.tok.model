liquidity and capital resources as a holding company  almost all of our funds generated from operations are earned by our operating subsidiaries 
we access these funds through receipt of dividends from these subsidiaries 
some of our subsidiaries are subject to requirements of various regulatory bodies  including the sec  finra  the cboe  the cftc and the nfa  relating to liquidity and capital standards  which may limit the funds available for the payment of dividends to us 
we invest company cash in a variety of high credit quality investment vehicles including us government treasury bills  bank issued commercial paper  aaa rated institutional money market funds and tax free ars backed by united states department of education guaranteed student loans issued under the ffelp 
our ars are marketable securities with long term stated maturities during years for which the interest rates are reset through periodic short term auctions every or days  depending on the issue 
as a result of the liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets  all of the auctions for all our ars have failed since february failed auctions limit liquidity for ars holders until there is a successful auction  the issuer redeems the security  or another market for ars develops 
we have reclassified all of our investments in ars from short term investments to investments in securities as a result of the uncertainty of when these ars could be successfully liquidated 
our ars portfolio consists entirely of securities backed by student loans issued under the ffelp program  which are individually guaranteed by the united states department of education 
all of our ars are aaa rated with the exception of two issues totaling million in par value and all of our ars are current with respect to receipt of interest payments according to the stated terms of each ars indenture 
as of the date of this report  we have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ars will be unable to satisfy the terms of the indentures or that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing our ars investments has deteriorated 
since the ars markets began failing on february   million of our ars securities have been redeemed by issuers at par 
we believe we have the ability  if necessary  to hold our ars investments until such time as the auctions are successful  the issuer redeems the securities  or another market for ars develops 
at december   there was insufficient observable ars market information available to determine the market value of our investments in ars 
therefore  we have continued to designate the ars as level financial assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and estimated the level fair values for these securities by using the income method  incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
we calculate the income by developing a discounted cash flow model based on the expected cash flows from the ars compared to a market rate 
some of these assumptions include credit quality  long term contractual interest rates paid by the issuers in the event of auction failures  estimates of the economic life of the ars including the probability of the ars being called or becoming liquid prior to the final maturity and the fair market interest rates for the ars 
for the economic life of the ars  we relied on estimates based in part on issuer statements regarding the intent and likelihood of the ars being redeemed or refinanced  the economic life of the loans currently outstanding in the trusts and observed redemption and refinance activity throughout based on our analysis  the weighted average economic life was estimated to be approximately four to five years 
for the 
table of contents current yield of the ars  we used the long term default rates as described in the indentures of the individual ars  which we then adjusted for the expected tax benefit 
for the fair market interest rates used in our discounting analysis  we used a current market rate for liquid debt instruments of similar underlying assets and credit quality  with spreads of approximately bps bps over the london interbank offered rate libor 
we also relied upon the indentures underlying the ars and other market information in determining these assumptions 
of the million par value of ars as of december   approximately million were sold by ubs ag ubs and have been classified as trading securities 
in november  we accepted an offer from ubs  entitling us to sell at par value ars originally purchased from ubs at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  ubs put right 
prior to june   ubs is offering no net cost loans using our eligible ars as collateral to provide interim liquidity 
in accepting the offer  we granted ubs the authority to sell or auction the ars at par at any time up until the expiration date of the offer and released ubs from any claims relating to the marketing and sale of ars 
ars will continue to accrue and pay interest as determined by the auction process or the terms specified in the prospectus of the ars if the auction process fails 
ubs s obligations under the offer are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the offer 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the offer 
we have adopted the fair value option under sfas no 
to classify the ubs put right and the ars sold by ubs as trading securities 
our calculation of fair value of the ubs ars at december  implied an impairment of fair value of approximately million  which has been recorded as an unrealized loss in other income on the consolidated statement of operations 
this impairment has been substantially offset by a realized gain in the value of the ubs put right 
the fair value of the ars held at ubs is approximately million 
if ubs has insufficient funding to buy back the ars and the auction process continues to fail  we may incur losses on these ars 
the remaining million in par value ars were sold by another investment advisor  who has not made an offer similar to ubs  and therefore we have continued to classify them as available for sale securities 
our calculation of fair value of the ars not held at ubs at december  implied an impairment of fair value of approximately million  which has been recorded through other comprehensive income  and the carrying fair value of those ars was approximately million 
if the market conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income or impairment charges 
we may not be able to liquidate these investments unless the issuer calls the security  a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the security matures

as of december   there was no balance outstanding on this credit facility 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may issue equity or debt securities or enter into secured or additional unsecured lines of credit from time to time 
cash flow cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities increased despite a decrease in net income in compared to the primary reasons for the increase in cash provided by operating activities were the smaller increases in payables to brokerage customers and segregated cash and receivables from brokerage customers 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in cash provided by investing activities was the decrease in cash held in investments in securities

capital expenditures capital expenditures were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures for the years ended december  and included capitalized software development costs  which we capitalized in accordance with statement of position sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  primarily related to the development of our technology 
the decrease in capital expenditures was related to an increased level of capitalized software development which was more than offset by the absence of the investment made to prepare our new corporate headquarters for occupancy 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  there are certain customer activities that may result in contingencies that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
these activities may expose us to off balance sheet credit risk in the event the customers are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations 
many of our customer accounts are margin accounts 
in margin transactions  we may be obligated for credit extended to our customers by our clearing firms and subject to various regulatory and clearing firm margin requirements

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe the accounting policies that have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to make assumptions and estimates involving significant judgment relate to the fair value of our investments in securities  specifically our investments in ars  and capitalization of software development 
investments in securities our investments in securities consist of ars backed by student loans issued under the ffelp program and the ubs put right associated with ars held at ubs 
we determine the fair value of our ars and the ubs put right using the income method 
we calculate the income by developing a discounted cash flow model based on the expected cash flows from the ars compared to a market rate 
for additional information regarding our ars and our valuation methodology and assumptions  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources for the available for sale ars  if the calculated fair value is below the carrying amount of the securities  we then determine if the decline in value is other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in underlying credit ratings  forecasted recovery  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of 
table of contents time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and the probability that the scheduled cash payments will continue to be made 
when we conclude that an other than temporary impairment has resulted  the difference between the fair value and the carrying value is recorded as an impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations 
impairments that we conclude are temporary are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
software costs associated with software developed for internal use include capitalized costs based on sop and other related guidance 
capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software and payroll for employees directly associated with  and who devote time to  the development of the internal use software 
costs incurred in development and enhancement of the software that does not meet the capitalization criteria are expensed as incurred 
these capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
during the years ended december  and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  of software development costs 
in addition  during the years ended december  and  we expensed million and million for costs associated with software that did not meet the capitalization criteria 
the critical estimate related to this process is the determination of the amount of time devoted by employees to specific stages of internal use software development projects 
we utilize a project management tool to assist in validating the underlying estimates used in the determination of time devoted 
we periodically review the capitalized costs for impairment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks in the normal course of our business operations 
we do not have material exposure to commodity price changes  foreign currency fluctuations or similar market risks other than the effect they may have on trading volumes 
accordingly  we have not entered into any derivative contracts to mitigate such risks 
interest rate risk as a self clearing broker dealer  we hold interest earning assets  mainly customer funds required to be segregated in compliance with federal regulations 
interest earning assets are financed primarily by short term interest bearing liabilities in the form of customer cash balances 
we earn a net interest spread on the customer balances  as well as on the difference between amounts earned on customer margin loans and amounts paid on customer cash balances 
since we set the rate paid on customer cash balances and the rate charged on customer margin loans  we are able to manage a substantial portion of our interest rate risk 
however  a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread while a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread 
since december   the federal open market committee has lowered the federal funds target rate times for a total of 
because the reductions occurred gradually throughout  the full impact of the interest rate cuts is not reflected in our interest income 
based on interest rates and balances as of december   we estimate that all of the decreases in short term interest rates during will result in a reduction of approximately million in our annual pretax income from levels 
in addition  we have estimated the additional impact to pretax income that hypothetical interest rate changes would have to balances as of december  we estimate that as of december   an immediate basis point increase in short term rates would result in an addition of approximately million in annual pre tax income from current levels 
although it is difficult to anticipate the behavior of money market participants if the federal funds target rate is lowered from a range of bps bps to bps  we estimate that a federal funds rate of bps would result in approximately million less in annual pretax income from current levels 
credit risk we extend margin credit and leverage to our customers  which are subject to various regulatory and clearing firm margin requirements 
margin credit balances are collateralized by cash and securities in the customers accounts 
leverage involves securing a large potential future obligation with a lesser amount of cash or securities 
the risks associated with margin credit and leverage increase during periods of fast market movements or in cases where leverage or collateral is concentrated and market movements occur 
during such times  customers who utilize margin credit or leverage and who have collateralized their obligations with securities may find that the securities have a rapidly depreciating value and may not be sufficient to cover their obligations in the event of liquidation 
we are exposed to credit risk when our customers execute transactions  such as short sales of options and equities or futures transactions that can expose them to risk beyond their invested capital 
at december   we had million in credit extended to our customers 
in addition  we may be obligated for margin extended to our customers by our third party clearing agents on collateralized securities and futures positions 

table of contents the margin and leverage requirements that we impose on our customer accounts meet or exceed those required by various regulatory requirements and regulation t of the board of governors of the federal reserve 
the amount of this risk is not quantifiable since the risk is dependent upon analysis of a potential significant and undeterminable rise or fall in stock prices 
as a result  we are exposed to significant off balance sheet credit risk in the event customer collateral is not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur 
in the event customers fail to satisfy their obligations  we may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices to fulfill the customers obligations 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements  and no liabilities related to these guarantees and indemnifications have been recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we borrow securities temporarily from other broker dealers in connection with our broker dealer business 
we deposit cash as collateral for the securities borrowed 
decreases in securities prices may cause the market value of the securities borrowed to fall below the amount of cash deposited as collateral 
in the event the counterparty to these transactions does not return the cash deposited  we may be exposed to the risk of selling the securities at prevailing market prices 
we seek to manage this risk by requiring credit approvals for counterparties  by monitoring the securities values on a daily basis  and by requiring additional collateral as needed 
securities risk in order to help us provide our customers with the most favorable trade execution  we sometimes take proprietary short term positions in listed equity and option securities 
we attempt to manage this risk by hedging our proprietary positions so that changes in market prices do not materially change the value of our securities  however  our hedging strategy may not be effective and may expose us to losses on these securities
