non gaap financial measure return on investment roi is an important internal measure for us because it is a key component of our evaluation of overall performance and the performance of our business segments 
studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between shareholder value and roi and that shareholder value is created when roi exceeds the cost of capital 
roi allows us to evaluate our performance on a consistent basis as the amount we earn relative to the amount invested in our business segments 
a significant portion of senior management s compensation is based on achieving roi targets 
in evaluating overall performance  we define roi as total segment operating income  less general and administrative expenses and share based compensation not included in segments  divided by total assets  less certain assets and certain current liabilities 
we do not believe there is a comparable gaap financial measure to our definition of roi 
the reconciliation of our roi calculation to amounts reported under gaap is included in a later section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
despite its importance to us  roi is a non gaap financial measure that has no standardized definition and as a result may not be comparable with other companies measures using the same or similar terms 
also there may be limits in the usefulness of roi to investors 
as a result  we encourage you to read our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 
accounting policies critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  we follow generally accepted accounting principles  which in many cases require us to make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
many of these principles are relatively straightforward 
there are  however  a few accounting policies that are critical because they are important in determining our financial condition and results  and they are difficult for us to apply 
they include asset impairments  contingency reserves  pension accounting and income taxes 
the difficulty in applying these policies arises from the assumptions  estimates and judgments that we have to make currently about matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future economic conditions  operating results and valuations  as well as our intentions 
as the difficulty increases  the level of precision decreases  meaning actual results can  and probably will  be different from those currently estimated 
we base our assumptions  estimates  and judgments on a combination of historical experiences and other factors that we believe are reasonable 
we have reviewed the selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with our audit committee 
measuring assets for impairment requires estimating intentions as to holding periods  future operating cash flows and residual values of the assets under review 
changes in our intentions  market conditions  or operating performance could require us to revise the impairment charges we previously provided 

table of contents contingency reserves are established for potential losses related to litigation  environmental remediation and other items 
estimating these reserves requires us to make certain judgments and assumptions regarding actual or potential claims  interpretations to be made by courts or regulatory bodies  and other factors and events that are outside our control 
changes and inaccuracies in our interpretations and actions of others could require us to revise the reserves we previously provided 
the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is an important assumption in determining pension expense 
in selecting that rate  particular consideration is given to our asset allocation because percent of our plan assets are debt related with a duration that closely matches that of our benefit obligation 
another important consideration is the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligation 
we determined the discount rate by referencing the citigroup pension discount curve 
we believe that using a yield curve more accurately reflects changes in the present value of our defined benefit plan obligation because each year s cash flow will be discounted at a rate at which it could effectively be settled versus the use of a single index rate 
we previously referenced an index for long term  high quality bonds  ensuring that the duration of that index did not materially differ from the duration of the plan s liabilities 
differences between actual and expected rates of return and changes in the discount rate will affect future pension expense and funded status 
for example  a basis point change in the discount rate would affect the projected benefit obligation by about million and the net periodic pension cost by about million 
a basis point change in the expected long term rate of return would affect the net periodic pension cost by about million 
tax provisions are based on the respective tax rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
where we believe a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes  it is included in the respective tax return 
when a position is uncertain  a liability is recorded for the most likely outcome considering the technical merits of the position and specific facts 
changes to liabilities are only made when an event occurs that changes the most likely outcome  such as settlement with the relevant tax authority  expiration of statutes of limitations  changes in tax law  or recent court rulings 
new accounting pronouncements in the last three years  we adopted a number of new accounting pronouncements  including in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements and sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
in addition  there are three new accounting pronouncements that we will be required to adopt in none of which we expect to have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

results of operations for the years   and summary our two key objectives are maximizing roi and profitably growing our business 

table of contents we will accomplish our key objectives through execution of our strategic initiatives 
our key strategic initiatives in corrugated packaging are maintaining full integration  driving for low cost through asset utilization and manufacturing excellence  improving mix and margins through sales excellence  and growing our business 
our key strategic initiatives in building products are delivering a tailored portfolio of building products  driving for low cost through manufacturing excellence  serving growing markets with favorable demographics  and promoting sales excellence 
in  consistent with our key strategic initiatives we had record production in our containerboard mills through manufacturing excellence 
we improved asset utilization and lowered costs in our box plants through our box plant transformation 
we grew our business through the purchase of our partner s percent interest in pbl  a joint venture that manufactures containerboard and gypsum facing paper at a mill in newport  indiana 
late in  we began producing white top linerboard at this mill 
we continued to drive down our costs throughout our company

while we continued to see the benefits in our manufacturing operations from our initiatives to lower costs  improve asset utilization  and increase operating efficiencies  the increased cost of energy  freight  and fiber in our corrugated packaging operations more than offset these benefits 
share based compensation decreased due to the effect of the lower share price on our cash settled awards 
we incurred million of costs primarily related to our transformation plan  of which million is related to the settlement of supplemental retirement benefits 
we also decreased litigation reserves by million due to the settlement of the remaining claim related to our antitrust litigation

we experienced higher prices for our corrugated packaging products  however  we experienced lower prices and volumes for most of our building products 
while we continue to see the benefit in our manufacturing operations from our initiatives to lower costs  improve asset utilization  and increase operating efficiencies  the higher cost of recycled fiber used at our containerboard mills offset some of the benefits 
we recognized million in charges  including million as a result of the decision to cease production permanently at our mt

shipments in were slightly lower than in and shipments increased in due to increased mill production 
costs and expenses were up eight percent in compared with  up one percent in compared with  and up one percent in compared with in  the increased costs were primarily the result of higher prices for recycled fiber  energy  chemicals  freight  and the inclusion of pbl since its purchase in july in  higher raw material costs were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement costs  million in business interruption and other insurance proceeds primarily related to an equipment outage and other operational issues at our mills that occurred in  and cost reductions attributable to the sale of performance sheets 
increased mill reliability and efficiency resulted in lower maintenance costs and improved raw material yield and energy usage

table of contents items not included in segments items not included in segments are income and expenses that are managed on a company wide basis and include corporate general and administrative expense  share based compensation  other operating and non operating income expense  and interest income and expense 
the million decrease in general and administrative expense in was principally due to our cost reduction efforts including headcount reductions of percent in business support and a decrease in incentive compensation 
the million decrease in was primarily related to a decrease in incentive compensation 
incentive compensation fluctuates based on changes in roi 
our share based compensation fluctuates because a significant portion of our share based awards are cash settled and are affected by changes in the market price of our common stock 
the million decrease in share based compensation in was principally due to the decrease in the market price of our common stock

in the s  we entered into two sale lease back transactions of production facilities with municipalities 
we entered into these transactions to mitigate property and similar taxes associated with these facilities 
the municipalities purchased these facilities from us for million  our carrying value  and we leased the facilities back from the municipalities under capital lease agreements  which expire in and concurrently  we purchased million of interest bearing bonds issued by these municipalities 
the bond terms are identical to the lease terms  are secured by payments under the capital lease obligations  and the municipalities are obligated only to the extent the underlying lease payments are made by us 
the interest rate implicit in the leases is the same as the interest rate on the bonds 
as a result  the present value of the capital lease obligations is million  the same as the principal amount of the bonds 
since there is no legal right of offset  the million of bonds are included in other assets and the million present value of the capital lease obligations are included in other long term liabilities

the purchase obligations are valued at year end market prices  however  our actual future purchases will be at the then current market prices 
purchase obligations include billion related to a pulpwood supply agreement that expires in and a sawtimber supply agreement that expires in both of which can be extended 
these supply agreements were entered into in conjunction with the sale of our timberlands 
we have other long term liabilities  principally liabilities for pension and postretirement benefits  unrecognized tax benefits  and deferred income taxes that are not included in the table because they do not have scheduled maturities

we do not expect any significant changes in our deferred tax liability in our cash tax rate is impacted by utilization of our alternative minimum tax credits 
at year end  we do not have any outstanding derivative instruments 
our interest rate derivative instruments that were outstanding at year end expired in financial assets and nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities we sold our strategic timberland on october  for billion 
the total consideration consisted almost entirely of notes due in issued by the buyer of the timberland 
the notes are secured by billion of irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by four banks  which are required to maintain a credit rating on their long term unsecured debt of at least a by s p and a by moody s 
the letters of 
table of contents credit are secured by the buyer s long term deposits with the banks of billion of cash and cash equivalents 
on december   two wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiaries formed by us borrowed billion repayable in from a group of lenders affiliated with citibank  na  and led by citicorp north america  inc  as agent  under substantially similar loan agreements 
the loans are nonrecourse to us and are secured only by the billion of notes and the letters of credit 
the loan agreements provide that if a credit rating of any bank issuing letters of credit is downgraded below the required level  the letters of credit issued by that bank must be replaced within days with letters of credit from another qualifying financial institution 
on december   s p lowered its credit rating of one of the letter of credit banks  dexia credit local  to a 
to replace the letters of credit issued by dexia  suntrust bank  at the request of the buyer of the timberland  issued substitute letters of credit totaling approximately million on january  and replaced dexia as a qualified letter of credit issuer in the transaction 
in order to maintain a constant deposit margin equal to that paid by dexia  we were required to pay million to suntrust 
this payment will be amortized through  the remaining life of the transaction  at a rate of less than million per year 
following this substitution  the four banks issuing letters of credit in the transaction are now barclays plc  soci t gen ral  and sun trust bank  each of which has issued letters of credit totaling about million  and the royal bank of scotland plc  which has issued letters of credit totaling million 
currently each of these banks meets the required minimum credit ratings 
however  in light of current conditions in financial markets  there is no assurance that these credit ratings will be maintained 
if we were required to find a substitute letter of credit issuer because of a credit rating change and were unable to do so  it is possible that a portion of the deferred taxes from the gain on the sale of our timberlands would become currently payable 
we currently have alternative minimum tax credits available to offset a substantial portion of any federal taxes that would become payable 
the net payment required would vary depending on the bank involved  the portion of the transaction represented and amount of alternative minimum tax credits available  but would likely be in the range of million to million 
if there were a second failed substitution  it is possible that the remaining deferred taxes from the gain on the sale of our timberlands would become currently payable  less any remaining available alternative minimum tax credits 
in addition  some or all of the difference between the purchase notes and the obligations under the loan agreements  approximately million in total  would be available to pay any such taxes 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements to facilitate our operating activities 
at year end  our off balance sheet unfunded arrangements  excluding contractual interest payments  operating leases  and purchase and other obligations included in the table of contractual obligations  consist of expiring by year total thereafter in millions joint venture guarantees performance bonds and recourse obligations we participate in one joint venture that produces medium density fiberboard in el dorado  arkansas 
our partner in this venture is a publicly held company unrelated to us 
at year end  this venture had million in long term debt and million of debt included in current maturities  along with various letters of credit 
we guaranteed million of the joint venture debt and letters of credit 
our joint venture partner also provided guarantees of the debt and letters of credit 
generally we would be called upon to fund the guarantees due to the lack of specific performance by the joint ventures  such as non payment of debt 
performance bonds and recourse obligations are comprised of million of letters of credit to support workers compensation obligations  an million letter of credit to support an operating lease obligation  and million of letters of credits primarily to support environmental cleanup obligations 

table of contents pension  postretirement medical and health care matters our non cash defined benefit pension expense in was million and  in addition  we recognized million of expense related to lump sum settlements of supplemental payments 
we expect our non cash defined benefit pension expense to be about million 
in  we made significant changes to our asset allocation to a more matched position between assets and liabilities in our qualified defined benefit plan 
this action is expected to reduce the volatility of our defined benefit expense and our funding requirements 
as a result  we have targeted to percent of our plan assets to be invested in debt securities that we believe have a duration that approximates our benefit obligation 
the remaining plan assets are targeted to be invested in assets that provide market exposure to mitigate the effects of inflation  mortality and actuarial risks 
the funded status of our defined benefit plan was a liability of million at year end and million at year end the change was principally due to a lower than expected return on plan assets  partially offset by million in voluntary  discretionary contributions we made in unrecognized actuarial losses  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and principally represent the delayed recognition of changes in the discount rate and differences between expected and actual returns  were million at year end and million at year end these losses will be recognized over the average remaining service period of our current employees  which is about nine years 
we expect about million of these losses will be recognized in  compared with million recognized in our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is percent for both and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption we make reflecting the anticipated weighted average rate of earnings on the plan assets over the long term 
in selecting that rate particular consideration is given to our asset allocation that reflects our matched position between the assets and liabilities of our qualified defined benefit plan 
the discount rate we used to determine the present value of the benefit obligations at year end was percent 
we determined this rate using the citigroup pension discount curve 
previously we used the december one month average of the moody s aa corporate bond rate adjusted to reflect the effect of compounding 
we believe that using a yield curve more accurately reflects changes in the present value of our defined benefit plan obligation because each year s cash flow is discounted at a rate at which it could effectively be settled versus the use of a single index rate 
we have no minimum funding requirement under erisa in beginning in  benefits earned under the supplemental defined benefit plan are paid upon retirement or when the employee terminates 
in addition in  we made lump sum payments of million to existing retirees who elected to receive a lump sum settlement of supplemental benefits earned 
the funded status of our postretirement medical plans projected benefit obligation was a liability of million at year end and million at year end we expect our payments to participants in our postretirement medical plans to be about million

table of contents energy and the effects of inflation energy costs increased million in  decreased million in and increased million in the increase in is primarily attributable to the higher market prices 
the decrease in is primarily attributable to reduced usage as a result of lower operating rates at several of our building products facilities 
we continue to reduce our dependency on natural gas by utilizing biomass fuels 
our energy costs fluctuate based on the market prices we pay 
we hedge very little of our energy needs 
it is likely that these costs will continue to fluctuate in inflationary increases in compensation and certain input costs such as fiber  energy and freight have had a negative impact on our operating results 
however  we have managed to offset a portion of the impact of inflation through increased productivity 
our fixed assets are carried at historical costs 
if carried at current replacement costs  depreciation expense would have been significantly higher than what we reported 
environmental protection our operations are subject to federal  state  and local provisions regulating discharges into the environment and otherwise related to the protection of the environment 
compliance with these provisions requires us to invest substantial funds to modify facilities to assure compliance with applicable environmental regulations 
please read business environmental regulation 
litigation matters we are involved in various legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of doing business 
in our opinion  the possibility of a material loss from any of these proceedings is considered to be remote  and we do not expect that the effect of these proceedings will be material to our financial position  results of operations  or cash flow 
it is possible  however  that charges related to these matters could be significant to results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk is primarily due to our variable rate  long term debt and to the financial assets and nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities 
this risk is the result of changes in interest rates and also the use of different base rates and the timing of the quarterly interest rate resets on the financial assets and nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities 
this risk could be volatile in light of current conditions in the financial markets and the erratic movements of libor 
our variable rate debt was million at year end and million at year end a one percent change in interest rates on our variable rate debt would change our annual interest expense by million 
our billion of financial assets of special purpose entities require quarterly interest payments based on variable rates referenced to libor that reset quarterly 
a one percent change in interest rates on these financial assets will change our annual interest income by million 
our billion of nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities require quarterly interest payments based on variable interest rates 
the interest rates on these liabilities reflect the lenders pooled commercial paper issuance rates and reset daily 
a one percent change in interest rates on these liabilities will change our annual interest expense by million 
the following table illustrates the estimated effect on our pre tax income of immediate  parallel  and sustained shifts in interest rates for the next months at year end on our variable rate debt and our net financial assets and nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities  with comparative year end information 
these estimates assume that debt reductions from contractual payments will be replaced with short term  variable rate debt  however  that may not be the financing alternative we choose to follow 
increase decrease year end year end special special change in variable purpose variable purpose interest rates rate debt entities net total rate debt entities net total in millions foreign currency risk we do not have significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on our financial instruments because most of these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
commodity price risk from time to time we use commodity derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in product pricing and manufacturing costs 
these instruments cover a small portion of our volume 
considering the fair value of these instruments at year end  we believe the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical ten percent change in the underlying commodity prices would not be significant
