item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report 
overview we design  develop  market and license memory intellectual property  or ip  used by the semiconductor industry 
our patented memory solutions include t sram and t flash high density alternatives to traditional volatile and non volatile embedded memory 
we license these technologies to companies that incorporate  or embed  memory on complex integrated circuits  such as systems on chips  or socs 
our customers typically include fabless semiconductor companies  integrated device manufacturers  or idms  and foundries 
we generate revenue from the licensing of our ip  and our customers pay us fees for licensing  non recurring engineering services  royalties and maintenance and support 
royalty revenues are typically earned under our license agreements when our licensees manufacture or sell products that incorporate any of our technologies 
generally  we expect our total sales cycle  or the period from our initial discussion with a prospective licensee to our receipt of royalties from the licensee s use of our technologies  to run from to months 
the portion of our sales cycle from the initial discussion to the receipt of license fees may run from to months  depending on the complexity of the proposed project and degree of development services required 
in  we began delivering our t sram classic memory macro products to licensees 
these macros are silicon proven  pre configured and high density solutions offering customers rapid memory block integration into their soc designs with minimal additional customization 
we believe they will enable us to increase our penetration of the market for very dense  low power  high speed embedded memory applications 
in the third quarter of  we acquired analog mixed signal integrated circuit designs  intellectual property  related assets and subsidiaries from atmel corporation  or atmel  and lsi design and integration corporation  or ldic 
in december  we announced our plan to shut down these acquired assets and incur up to million of exit costs 
sources of revenue we generate two types of revenue licensing and royalties 
licensing 
licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements  development services  prepaid pre production royalties  and support and maintenance 
our license agreements involve long sales cycles  which make it difficult to predict when the agreements will be signed 
in addition  our licensing revenues fluctuate from period to period  and it is difficult for us to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue from quarter to quarter 
moreover  we believe that the amount of licensing revenue for any period is not necessarily indicative of results in any future period 
our licensing revenue consists primarily of fees for providing circuit design  layout and design verification and granting licenses to customers that embed our technology into their products 
license fees generally range from  to several million dollars per contract  depending on the scope and complexity of the development project  and the extent of the licensee s rights 
the licensee generally pays the license fees in installments at the beginning of the license term and upon the attainment of specified milestones 
the vast majority of our contracts allow for milestone billing based on work performed 
fees billed prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 

table of contents royalty 
royalty revenue represents amounts earned under provisions in our licensing contracts that require our licensees to report royalties and make payments at a stated rate based on actual units manufactured or sold by licensees for products that include our technologies 
we generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee s report 
generally our license agreements provide for royalty payments at a stated rate 
we negotiate royalty rates by taking into account such factors as the anticipated volume of the licensee s sales of products utilizing our technologies and the cost savings to be achieved by the licensee through the use of our technology 
our license agreements generally require the licensee to report the manufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs 
as with our licensing revenue  the timing and level of royalties are difficult to predict 
they depend on the licensee s ability to market  produce and sell products incorporating our technology 
many of the products of our licensees that are currently subject to licenses from us are used in consumer products  such as electronic game consoles  for which demand can be seasonal 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the accounting policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
these policies may involve estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual future results may differ from our estimates  and if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
revenue recognition general we generate revenue from the licensing of our ip  and customers pay fees for licensing  development services  royalties and maintenance and support 
we apply the principles of the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of signed agreements 
when sales arrangements contain multiple elements eg  license and services  we apply the provisions of the financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine the separate units of accounting that exist within the agreement 
if more than one unit of accounting exists  the consideration payable to us under the agreement is allocated to each unit of accounting using either the relative fair value method or residual method as prescribed by eitf revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria of sab no 
have been met for that unit of accounting 
licensing for license agreements that do not require significant development  modification or customization  revenues are generally recognized when the criteria of sab no 
have been met 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer revenue recognition until such time as all criteria have been met 

table of contents for license agreements that include deliverables that require significant production  modification or customization  we apply american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
when we have significant experience in meeting the design specification involved in the contract and the direct labor hours related to services under the contract can be reasonably estimated  we recognize revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed 
for these arrangements  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress 
significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours 
these judgmental elements include determining that we have the experience to meet the design specifications and estimation of the total direct labor hours 
we follow this method because we can obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the direct labor hours to perform the contract services 
the direct labor hours for the development of the licensee s design are estimated at the beginning of the contract 
as these direct labor hours are incurred  they are used as a measure of progress towards completion 
we have the ability to reasonably estimate direct labor hours on a contract by contract basis from our experience in developing prior licensee s designs 
during the contract performance period  we review estimates of direct labor hours to complete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimates of revenue and gross profit under the contract if we revise the estimations of the direct labor hours to complete 
our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate in reported income in the period in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known 
under the percentage of completion method  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined 
for the year ended december   we recorded loss accruals on two agreements for a total of  no loss accruals were recorded during the years ended december  and if the amount of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion accounting method exceeds the amount of billings to a customer  then we account for the excess amount as an unbilled contract receivable 
our total unbilled contract receivables were  and  as of december  and  respectively 
for contracts involving design specifications that we have not previously met or if inherent risks make estimates doubtful  the contract is accounted for under the completed contract method  and we defer the recognition of all revenue until the design meets the contractual design specifications 
in this event  the cost of revenue is expensed as incurred 
when we have experience in meeting design specifications  but believe that we do not have significant experience to reasonably estimate the direct labor hours related to services to meet a design specification  we defer both the recognition of revenue and the cost 
we recognized  of revenue under the completed contract method in in and  no revenue was recognized using the completed contract method 
we also provide support and maintenance under many of our license agreements 
under these arrangements  we provide unspecified upgrades  design rule changes and technical support 
no other upgrades  products or other post contract support are provided 
we recognize support and maintenance revenue at its fair value established by objective evidence  ratably over the period during which the obligation exists  typically months 
these arrangements are renewable annually by the customer 
revenue from support and maintenance was   and  in  and  respectively  and was included in licensing revenue 
from time to time  a licensee may cancel a project during the development phase 
such a cancellation is not within our control and is often caused by changes in market conditions or the licensee s business 
cancellations of this nature are an aspect of our licensing business  and  in general  license contracts allow us to retain all payments that we have received or are entitled to collect for items and services provided before the cancellation occurs 
typically under our license agreements  the licensee is obligated to complete the project within a stated timeframe  including assisting us in completing the final milestone 
if we perform the contracted services  the licensee is obligated to pay 
table of contents the license fees even if the licensee fails to complete verification or cancels the project prior to completion 
for accounting purposes we will consider a project to have been canceled even in the absence of specific notice from its licensee  if there has been no activity under the contract for six months or longer  and we believe that completion of the contract is unlikely 
in this event  we recognize revenue in the amount of cash received  if we have performed a sufficient portion of the development services 
if a cancelled contract had been entered into before the establishment of technological feasibility  the costs associated with the contract would have been expensed prior to the recognition of revenue 
in that case  there would be no costs associated with that revenue recognition  and gross margin would increase for the corresponding period 
no license revenue from cancelled contracts was recognized in and license revenue from cancelled contracts was  in we also recognize pre production prepaid royalties as license revenues 
these are lump sum payments made when we enter into licensing agreements that cover future shipments of a product that is not commercially available from the licensee 
we characterize such payments as license revenues because they are paid as part of the initial license fee and not with respect to products being produced by the licensee 
royalty licensing contracts also provide for royalties based on licensees use of our technology in their currently shipping commercial products 
we generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee s report 
we may also recognize revenue from post production prepaid royalties  which are paid in a lump sum after the licensee commences production of the royalty bearing product and applied against future unit shipments regardless of the actual level of shipments by the licensee 
the criteria for revenue recognition of prepaid royalties are that a formal agreement with the licensee is executed  no deliverables  development or support services related to prepaid royalties are required  the fees are non refundable and not contingent upon future product shipments by the licensee  and the fees are payable by the licensee in a time period consistent with the our normal billing terms 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer revenue recognition until such time as all criteria have been met 
fair value measurements our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in money market accounts  auction rate securities  corporate debt  commercial paper  government agency securities and municipal debt securities 
in the current market environment  the assessment of the fair value of the securities can be difficult and subjective 
the volume of trading activity of certain securities has declined  and the rapid changes occurring in today s financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in the relatively short periods of time 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
level inputs used to measure fair value are unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
therefore  determining fair value for level investments generally does not require significant judgment  and the estimation is not difficult 
level pricing is provided by third party sources of market information obtained through our investment advisors 
we do not adjust for or apply any additional assumptions or estimates to the pricing information we receive from the advisors 
for level securities  we base the fair value of our cash equivalents and available for sale securities on pricing from third party sources of market information obtained through our investment advisors rather than models 
these cash equivalents 
table of contents and available for sale securities consisted primarily of commercial paper  corporate debt securities  and government agency and municipal bonds from issuers with high quality credit ratings 
our investment advisors obtain pricing data from independent sources  such as standard poor s  bloomberg and interactive data corporation  and rely on comparable pricing of other securities because the level securities we hold are not actively traded and have fewer observable transactions 
we consider this the most reliable information available for the valuation of the securities 
level inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment 
these values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions 
the determination of fair value for level investments involves the most management judgment and subjectivity 
all of our investments classified as level are auction rate securities collaterized by student loans substantially guaranteed by the us government 
since february  there has not been a successful auction in that there were insufficient buyers for these auction rate securities 
therefore  we transferred them from the level to level category as of march  in accordance with sfas no 
 we used the concept of fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows that included the following significant inputs and considerations projected interest income and principal payments through the expected holding period  a market risk adjusted discount rate  which was based on actual securities traded in the open market that had similar collateral composition to the auction rate securities as of december   adjusted for an expected yield premium to compensate for the current lack of liquidity resulting from failing auctions for such securities  and no default or collateral value risk adjustments were considered for the discount rate  because all of the issuers were aaa rated by nationally recognized rating agencies at december   and the auction rate securities were collateralized by student loans  the repayments of which were substantially guaranteed by the us department of education 
in november  we accepted an offer the right from ubs financial services  inc ubs by which ubs will purchase the auction rate securities from us  at our election  at par value at any time during the period from june  through july  prior to june   ubs can redeem the securities at par value at its sole election 
additionally  the auction rate securities are still subject to redemptions by the underlying issuers at any time 
as a result of the right  we no longer have the intent to hold the securities until maturity and the purchase of the securities by ubs may occur before the markets for these securities recover 
therefore  we have changed the classification of the auction rate securities to the trading securities category and reversed the unrecognized losses previously recorded in stockholders equity 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a realized loss on investments of million in the other income  net  line item in the consolidated statement of operations 
however  as we can elect to have ubs purchase the auction rate securities from us  we have accounted for the right as a separate freestanding financial asset measured at fair value  resulting in the recording of a long term asset with an offsetting gain of approximately million recorded in the other income  net  line item in the consolidated statements of operations 
we valued the right using a discounted cash flow approach including estimates of  based on data available as of december   interest rates  timing and amount of cash flow  adjusted for any bearer risk associated with ubs s financial ability to repurchase the auction rate securities beginning june  these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change 

table of contents on january   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
we did not elect the fair value option for our financial assets and liabilities existing on january   and did not elect the fair value option for any financial assets and liabilities transacted during the twelve months ended december   except for the right related to our auction rate securities  which permits us to elect the fair value option for recognized financial assets  in order to match the changes in the fair value of the right 
we will be required to assess the fair value of the right and auction rate securities and record changes each period until the right is exercised or the auction rate securities are redeemed 
we will continue to classify the auction rate securities as long term investments until june   one year prior to the expected settlement 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when a triggering event is deemed to have occurred 
this assessment is subjective in nature and requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results  projected cash flows and current period market capitalization levels 
if our estimates and assumptions change in the future  it could result in a material write down of long lived assets 
we amortize our finite lived intangible assets  such as developed technology  patents and workforce  on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to five years 
we recognize an impairment charge as the difference between the net book value of such assets and the fair value of the assets on the measurement date 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually on september and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
for step one  we determine the fair value of its reporting unit using the market approach 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on the market value of the reporting unit at the entity level 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of net assets to the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
we performed the annual impairment test during the third quarter of  and the test did not indicate impairment of goodwill 
as of december   we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill 
if our stock price continues to experience significant price and volume fluctuations  this will impact the fair value of the reporting unit  which can lead to potential impairment in future periods 
deferred tax valuation allowance when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets  which we show on our consolidated balance sheet under the category of other current assets 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon weighted available evidence  it is more likely 
table of contents than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of approximately million  of which approximately million was attributable to canadian loss and research and development pool carryforwards  million was attributable to us and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  and million to other temporary differences 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation costs in accordance with sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  and apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical and implied volatility of our stock price 
results of operations the following discussion compares the historical results of operations based on us generally accepted accounting principles for the years ended december   and revenues 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands licensing percentage of total revenues the million decrease in was primarily due to a decline in the value of license agreements for our t sram licenses compared with  although the total number of licensees increased in specifically  we signed new licenses for our t sram display driver interface application  which have lower license fees than our traditional t sram 
the million decrease in was primarily due to a significant decline in new customers and agreements for our classic macro products and t sram technology licenses 
licensing revenue from classic macros declined primarily because in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a royalty bearing technology license agreement with tsmc that allows them to develop and distribute t sram macro designs for which tsmc pays us royalties when they ship integrated circuits to their customers 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands royalty percentage of total revenues royalty revenue increased million in primarily due to an increase in royalties earned on the sales of socs incorporating our technology by nec for the nintendo wii game console  an increase in royalties received from a major foundry partner as production on the nm manufacturing 
table of contents process increased  and royalties received from a major oem customer that licenses our t sram for advanced mobile phone applications 
the increases were offset by decreased royalties received from licensees with products incorporating older generation technologies  such as products manufactured on the nm and nm processes 
royalty revenue increased million in primarily due to an increase in royalties earned on the sales of socs incorporating our technology by nec for the nintendo wii game console which reached volume production in the last quarter of cost of net revenues and gross profit 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands cost of net revenue percentage of total revenues cost of net revenues consists of personnel costs for engineers assigned to revenue generating licensing arrangements and related overhead allocation costs 
the increase in cost of net revenues for was primarily due to licensing arrangements for our t sram display driver interface application  which required the development of new macros for new foundry processes 
cost of revenue in included stock based compensation expense of million  a decrease of million over as a result of the increased engineering costs to fulfill our delivery obligations  our gross profit decreased from million in to million in and  as a percentage of total revenue  decreased slightly to of total revenue in from in we expect that cost of licensing revenues will continue to grow in absolute dollars because we anticipate entering into license agreements on smaller process geometries  such as the nm process and below  which require more development 
as a percentage of revenue  we expect to maintain the levels reported in and the increase in cost of net revenues for was primarily due to new licensing arrangements we entered into in  which required significantly increased engineering services 
those contracts required us to develop new memory macros for smaller manufacturing process geometries  and we incurred higher costs to fulfill our obligations 
cost of revenue in included stock based compensation expense of million  an increase of million over as a result of the significant increase in engineering costs under new licensing arrangements  our gross profit decreased from million in to million in and  as a percentage of total revenue  decreased to of total revenue in from in research and development 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands research and development percentage of total revenues our research and development expenses include development and design of variations of the t sram technologies for use in different manufacturing processes used by licensees  development of our t flash technology solution  costs related to the development of the analog mixed signal design technology  and amortization of intangible assets 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 

table of contents the million increase in was primarily due to the following million increase  primarily personnel related  attributable to the analog mixed signal technology and personnel acquired at the beginning of the third quarter of million increase in costs attributable to the expansion of our engineering team working on our non volatile t flash memory technology and t sram display driver interface applications  million increase in tape out charges to complete validation of our designs in silicon  million increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets from the atmel and ldic acquisitions  and million increase in license costs for our cad tools 
the million increase in was primarily due to the following million increase  primarily personnel related  attributable to the atmel and ldic asset acquisitions in the third quarter of  million attributable to the expansion of our engineering team working on our non volatile t flash memory technology and t sram display driver applications  million of amortization of purchased intangible assets from the atmel and ldic asset acquisitions  and million increase in stock based compensation expense 
although we plan to increase our development efforts in to enable the commercial launch of our new embedded memory ip technologies  we expect total research and development expense to decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues as a result of the elimination of the analog mixed signal product lines  after excluding the costs of exiting these product lines 
research and development expenses included stock based compensation expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands selling  general and administrative percentage of total revenues selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  customer support  finance  human resources and general management 
the million increase for was primarily due to the following million increase in stock based compensation expense  million expense reduction from the reversal of bad debt expense recorded in  million increase attributable to the hiring of additional personnel to expand our sales and marketing organizations to enhance our global presence and add analog mixed signal expertise  million reduction in legal costs  and million reduction in personnel costs in the general and administrative function due to lower headcount 

table of contents we expect total selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues as a result of cost saving measures taken to reduce headcount and consulting expenses 
the million increase for was primarily due to the following million increase in stock based compensation expense  million increase in salary and related costs  million increase in legal fees related to employment matters  million increase in bad debt expense attributable to one customer  million increase in marketing promotional activities  million of separation costs related to the departures of two executives  and million decrease in litigation expenses due to uniram in stock based compensation 
we recognized million  million and million as stock based compensation expense during the years ended december   and  respectively 
expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the total compensation cost of options granted  but not yet vested  as of december  was million  which is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of approximately years 
acquired in process research and development 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands in process research and development percentage of total revenues we recorded a charge of million in for purchased in process research and development expenses upon completion of the atmel and ldic asset acquisitions because technological feasibility of the acquired technology had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
the fair value of the projects was determined by estimating the present value of the net cash flows we believed would result from the acquired technology 
litigation settlement 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands litigation settlement percentage of total revenues in march  uniram technology  inc uniram filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california  alleging trade secret misappropriation and patent infringement 
in october  we entered into a settlement agreement with uniram under which we and uniram agreed to dismiss all outstanding claims and counterclaims with prejudice  and we paid uniram million and received a complete release of all claims as well as a future fully 
table of contents paid license for ourselves and all of our licensees with respect to uniram s relevant intellectual property 
impairment of intangible assets and restructuring charges 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands impairment of intangible assets and restructuring charges percentage of total revenues in the fourth quarter of  our management approved and initiated a plan to exit the unprofitable analog mixed signal product lines  which we had acquired in through asset purchase agreements with atmel and ldic 
in connection with these asset purchases  we had recorded intangible assets  which were being amortized over three to five years 
as a result of the plan to exit these product lines  the intangible assets were considered to have no future value and deemed impaired  as no future cash flows will be generated 
the remaining net book value  as of the date of management s announcement to exit the product lines  was written off 
this plan resulted in the elimination of approximately employees  mainly located in our subsidiaries in china and romania 
the total costs in associated with the restructuring were million  primarily related to accrued employee severance and the write off of computer equipment and other assets 
we expect to incur future additional restructuring charges related to this exit initiative in the range of million to million  primarily in the form of facility related exit costs  in the first half of total expected cash expenditures are expected to be million  which will primarily be incurred in the first quarter of this product line exit is expected to result in approximately a million reduction in annual operating expenses 
other income  net 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands other income  net percentage of total revenues other income  net primarily consisted of interest income on our investments  which was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income declined by million in primarily due to lower interest rates earned  as we transferred most of our cash into very high credit quality investments  such as money market funds that invest in securities of the us government and its agencies and bear interest at lower rates 
in addition  we had lower average investment balances during compared with the remaining decrease is primarily related to the impact of foreign exchange losses on balances denominated in foreign currencies 
we expect interest income to decline  as we expect to realize lower average interest rates on our portfolio in as we do not expect interest rates to increase significantly in from the levels they declined to in the fourth quarter of the increase in other income  net for was primarily due to a million increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments and a million decrease in other 
table of contents expenses due to a non recurring charge recorded in related to japan withholding taxes paid by japanese licensees on our behalf 
provision for income taxes 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands income tax provision percentage of total revenues our income tax provisions were primarily attributable to foreign jurisdictions 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes  approximately million for state income tax purposes and canadian loss and research and development pool carryforwards of approximately million that are available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal  canadian and applicable state income tax laws 
these net operating loss carryforwards expire from to in  we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will continue to be less than the federal statutory tax rate 
as of december  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
because of uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets  we had recorded a full valuation allowance as of december  and liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million  resulting in a combined balance of million compared with a combined balance of million at december  our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital 
cash used in operating activities was million for  which primarily resulted from the net loss of million  which was partially offset by non cash charges  including stock based compensation expense of million  depreciation and amortization of million  an intangible asset impairment charge of million  non cash restructuring charges of million and million generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash used in operating activities was million for  which primarily resulted from the net loss of million  and was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million resulting from a decline in sales  increases in non cash charges including the in process research and development charge of million  stock based compensation expense of million  million for depreciation and amortization and million of bad debt expense 
in  we spent approximately million of expenditures for property and equipment 
in  we spent approximately million of expenditures for property and equipment and million for the purchase of intangible and other assets from atmel and ldic in the third quarter of otherwise  our investing activities consisted of investing our cash in marketable securities and rolling over those investments 
net cash used in financing activities was million for  which was primarily attributable to million of cash expenditures during the fourth quarter of to repurchase approximately  shares of our own common stock under a repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors  partially offset by proceeds of million from stock option exercises 

table of contents net cash used in financing activities was million for  which was primarily attributable to million of cash expenditures during the third and fourth quarters of to repurchase approximately  shares of our own common stock under a repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors  partially offset by proceeds of million from stock option exercises 
our future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter  depending on numerous factors  including level and timing of licensing and royalty revenues  cost  timing and success of technology development efforts  including meeting customer design specifications  market acceptance of our existing and future technologies and products  competing technological and market developments  cost of maintaining and enforcing patent claims and intellectual property rights  variations in manufacturing yields  materials costs and other manufacturing risks  costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations  and profitability of our business 
although we expect to continue to expend cash in as we continue to expand research and development efforts for our t sram and t flash technologies  we expect our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  along with our existing capital and cash generated from operations  if any  to be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
as a result of our plan to exit the analog mixed signal product lines  we expect to incur cash expenditures of approximately million primarily in the first quarter of in addition  in october  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan 
since october  we have spent approximately million of our cash to repurchase shares under that plan 
we cannot be certain  however  that we will not require additional financing at some point in time 
should our cash resources prove inadequate  we may need to raise additional funding through public or private financings 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could have a material  adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payment due by period total less than year years more than years operating leases purchase commitments as of december   the company had purchase commitments of million for licenses related to computer aided design tools payable through december and a million purchase commitment for testing equipment 
included above is approximately million in future minimum lease payments attributable to a facility lease in china 
in connection with our exit of the analog mixed signal product lines and related

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk due to our investment portfolio 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including us government agencies  municipal notes  including auction rate securities  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we do not use interest rate swaps in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer or fund 
the investments other than money market funds and auction rate securities for which we have accepted the right to require their purchase by ubs and reclassified as trading securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
securities with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents 
securities with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short term investments 
securities with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long term investments 
all investments have a maturity of less than two years other than our auction rate securities  discussed further below 
no single security should exceed of the portfolio at the time of purchase 
these securities  which approximated million as of december  and earned an average annual interest rate of approximately in  are subject to interest rate and credit risks 
as of december   we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio 
according to our analysis  parallel shifts in the yield curve of both would result in changes in 
table of contents fair market values for these investments of approximately million 
we do not have any investments denominated in foreign country currencies  and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments 
as of december   we held million net of million in recognized losses of investments  classified as long term investments  with an auction reset feature auction rate securities whose underlying assets were primarily in student loans 
all of the issuers of our auction rate securities had an aaa credit rating at december  auctions for all of these auction rate securities failed in early  which means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not do so as a result of a lack of buying demand 
as a result of auction failures  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities was limited 
in november  we accepted an offer from ubs by which ubs will purchase the auction rate securities from us  at our election  at par value at any time during the period from june  to july  in lieu of our making this election  the auction rate securities will continue to accrue and pay interest as determined by the auction process or the terms specified in the prospectus of the auction rate securities if the auction process fails 
ubs s obligations under the offer are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the offer 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the offer 
if ubs has insufficient funding to buy back the auction rate securities and the auction process continues to fail  then we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the auction rate securities 
foreign currency exchange rate risk currently  all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains or losses to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases  we may choose to hedge those exposures 
for most currencies  we are a net payer of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a stronger us dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker us dollar relative to those foreign currencies
