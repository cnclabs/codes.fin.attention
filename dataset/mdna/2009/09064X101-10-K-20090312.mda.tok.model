item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop and commercialize innovative products to help stimulate the body s natural tissue regenerative process 
we believe our protein therapeutic device combination product candidates have the potential to significantly improve the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries and conditions affecting bones  tendons  ligaments and cartilage 
our platform regenerative technology  which incorporates a potent version of one of the body s natural key stimulators of tissue repair  may offer physicians advanced biological solutions to actively stimulate tissue healing and regeneration 
we have already demonstrated that this technology is safe and effective in stimulating bone and periodontal regeneration in the jaws with the us and canadian regulatory approvals and commercialization of our first product  gem s growth factor enhanced matrix 
with the divestiture of gem s in january  we are now focused on developing this technology to stimulate tissue healing in orthopedic  and potentially spine and sports injury  applications 
our current product candidates use the same key stimulator as gem s  and are designed to target a broad range of clinical indications in bone  cartilage  ligament and tendon repair 
we currently have seven orthopedic clinical studies that are completed or are under way which seek to demonstrate the safety  clinical utility and or efficacy of our product candidates in the pipeline  including our lead orthopedic product candidate augment bone graft augment  formerly gem os bone graft  in treating bone defects and injuries 
in addition  we have pre clinical programs focused on the development of treatments for bone defects in the spine and various sports injury applications  including those requiring cartilage  ligament and tendon repair 
we have reported the results of a number of these studies  and those studies suggest that our platform technology will be effective in our target applications 
if successful  we expect these clinical studies should lead to regulatory approval of our regenerative product candidates in the united states  canada and europe 
if approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities  we believe that our product candidates will offer new  effective and less invasive treatment options in orthopedics  spine and sports related injuries to improve the quality of life for millions of patients suffering injuries or deterioration of bones  ligaments  tendons and cartilage 
however  according to the national bureau of economic research  the us economy has been in a recession since december this economic downturn and the ensuing instability of markets have impacted us by making it difficult to resolve the liquidity issues on our auction rate securities ars investments 
since the collapse of the ars market in february  we have been unable to liquidate the million par value in ars investments that we hold as of december  furthermore  our general business strategy may be further adversely affected if the current economic conditions deteriorate further  or do not improve 
for example  the economy may impact the demand for elective medical procedures that we are targeting with our product candidates  or may impact the pricing that we may set for our products 
however  since our anticipated product launch for our lead product candidate remains over a year away  the impact of the current recession on commercial markets for that product remains uncertain 
we have responded to the current economic crisis by investing our cash and cash equivalents and our short term investments conservatively  securing a short term credit facility to provide some liquidity for our ars investments  and initiating cost reduction measures such as scaling back growth in staff to conserve cash and manage expenses 
in addition  to the extent possible given contractual commitments  in order to postpone major expenses we have postponed certain major equipment purchases  delivery and validation efforts for manufacturing equipment intended for a new manufacturing facility that is being built in the same complex as our headquarters in franklin  tennessee 
we have leased a portion of this new facility and we intend to move certain of our manufacturing operations to it once completed 
also  we have filed an arbitration claim against deutsche bank securities  inc dbsi seeking to force them to repurchase the illiquid ars investments that they purchased on our behalf in managing our discretionary cash management account 

table of contents recent developments clinical trial updates augment bone graft north american augment pivotal study foot and ankle fusions on december   enrollment in the north american augment pivotal clinical trial was closed with a total of patients enrolled 
this clinical trial seeks to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of augment to stimulate bone healing in foot and ankle fusions  and is a randomized  controlled  non inferiority study comparing augment to autograft  the current gold standard for bone grafting in this type of surgery 
the trial was designed to enroll patients  however  enrollment continued through december  to accommodate those additional patients who had already consented into the study and scheduled for surgery 
we plan to file a modular pre market approval pma application for augment beginning in the spring of a modular submission breaks the pma document into three sections or modules filed at different times that together become a complete application 
the modular approach allows the applicant to potentially resolve any concerns noted by fda earlier in the review process than would occur with a traditional pma application  and may ultimately shorten the review and approval timeline 
the pre clinical section of the modular pma is expected to be submitted in march the quality and manufacturing section is on schedule to be filed in the spring of allowing time for the fda to review this data in advance of the clinical data 
we expect to file the clinical data with the fda in the fourth quarter of as the last element of our modular pma application 
eu augment trial foot and ankle fusions in november  we completed enrollment in the eu clinical study with augment for the treatment of foot and ankle fusions with a total enrollment of patients 
this study is an open label trial and was designed to enroll up to patients 
the assumption when designing the study was that among a population of foot and ankle fusion patients  we would likely enroll hindfoot ankle fusion patients the north american indication and midfoot fusion patients 
however  when we reached patients  we had exceeded the hindfoot ankle target of patients  and decided to cease enrollment 
all other aspects of the original study protocol will continue unchanged 
we expect that the data from the study will be released in the first quarter of and will support eu and other worldwide filings on augment 
clinical trial updates augment injectable bone graft canadian augment injectable pilot trial foot and ankle fusions this trial is a canadian study investigating the use of augment injectable bone graft augment injectable in patients being treated for foot and ankle fusions 
the trial is an open label study with seven of the patients considered to be high risk for poor healing as a result of co morbidities 
the results of the study demonstrated that all patients achieved complete clinical success by six months after surgery 
in addition  analysis of ct scans at three to four months after surgery showed that percent of the patients had achieved radiographic fusion 
consistent with our previous studies  there were no serious adverse events sae related to the device 
eu augment injectable pilot trial distal radius fractures this trial is a swedish study investigating the use of augment injectable in patients being treated for fractures of the distal radius wrist 
a total of patients have been enrolled in the study  consisting of patients treated with augment injectable combined with external fixation and patients treated with external fixation alone 
enrollment in the study was completed in december the results of data analysis shows patients treated with augment injectable demonstrated earlier bone formation at three and six weeks as measured by ct scans 
the six month evaluation of complete bone fill  defined as more than percent fill of the fracture gap  was percent for augment injectable patients  as compared to percent for the patients treated with external fixation alone 
the product candidate was demonstrated to be safe  with no reported adverse events related to the study devices 

table of contents regulatory filings augment canadian filing in the second quarter of  we filed a device license application dla with health canada for augment bone graft 
the dla submission is required in canada for approval of the commercialization of augment as a medical device for use in the treatment of foot and ankle fusions 
we received some initial questions on the filing that we responded to in september we have now received a letter from health canada setting forth what we believe are the remaining open questions on the dla 
we believe that we can address these questions  and we anticipate a final decision on the dla around the middle of gem s european union filing we previously announced that the marketing authorization application maa for gem s was validated and was under review by the european medicines agency emea 
we have received a preliminary report from the emea wherein they raise a number of issues that we must address before the maa will be approved 
in the report  the emea questions the sufficiency of the data that we submitted to establish efficacy of gem s  and in particular questions the sufficiency of our six month patient pivotal study to prove efficacy of a medicinal product 
in addition  the emea raised questions regarding the specifications for the pdgf drug substance 
approval of the maa submission is required for distribution and commercialization of gem s as a medicinal combination product in the european union eu 
we expect to receive the final report on the maa submission by the middle of the approval of gem s in the eu will trigger a million milestone payment to us from luitpold pharmaceuticals  inc luitpold  a us subsidiary of daiichi sankyo co  ltd  who owns and markets gem s through its osteohealth company 
based on the issues raised in the emea s preliminary report  the timing of our receipt of the million milestone payment is uncertain  and therefore our financial guidance for excludes this payment 
patent updates in november  we announced the united states patent office has allowed the company s us patent application no 
 titled platelet derived growth factor compositions and methods of use thereof 
the allowed claims within this patent application cover compositions of platelet derived growth factor pdgf combined with matrix materials having defined characteristics  which cover our regenerative protein therapeutic device combination products candidates augment and augment injectable 
during the time in which the patent is in force  it will prohibit the marketing by potential competitors of similar or generic versions of augment  augment injectable  gem s and potentially other products we have in development 
the new patent was originally to remain in force until  however  in january  we also announced that the united states patent office issued patent number  which granted a term extension that will provide us with protection for our augment product line  as well as certain other pdgf product formulations  until at least june financial overview since inception in  we have funded our operations from the sale of capital stock including redeemable preferred stock  our initial public offering ipo in may and our secondary public offering in february  from the licensing and sale of our orofacial therapeutic business in january  from a credit facility with deutsche bank ag deutsche bank and from research and development agreements  grants and product sales 
the proceeds of these activities are reflected in the balance of cash and investments totaling million as of december   which includes million in long term marketable securities 
these long term marketable securities consist of student loan backed auction rate securities ars that are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value and have a credit rating of aaa or a there is currently no viable market for these ars investments  and we cannot be sure if the market will reform or if our ars investments will be liquidated in a timely manner 
auctions for these ars investments have failed since february  and we have not been able to sell them 
consequently  an other than temporary impairment in fair value of our ars investments has resulted and an impairment loss of million is recorded on our consolidated statements of operations as of december  to address the liquidity issues associated with these ars investments in the short term  in october we entered into a time promissory note note credit facility with deutsche bank enabling us to borrow up to million with certain of our ars investments serving as collateral 
as of december   we have borrowed million  and as such these funds are reflected in the balance of cash and investments  as well as the related note payable liability  on our consolidated balance sheets 
we continue to incur research and development expenses due to the substantial expansion of our internal research capabilities and due to the numbers of patients we have enrolled and expect to enroll in the clinical trials of augment and our other product candidates 
we will make determinations as to which product candidates to advance and how much funding to direct to each on an ongoing basis in response to their scientific and clinical success 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase as a result of new and ongoing clinical trials and pre clinical studies of augment in the united states  canada and the eu  as well as continuing expenses associated with regulatory filings  including the eu regulatory filing for gem s 
the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the five years ended december  direct external costs represent significant expenses paid to third parties that 
table of contents specifically relate to the clinical development of augment  such as payments to contract research organizations  clinical investigators  manufacture of clinical material  consultants  contract manufacturing start up costs  manufacturing scale up costs  milestone payments and insurance premiums for clinical studies 
in addition  employee costs salaries  payroll taxes  benefits  and travel for employees of the manufacturing  regulatory affairs  clinical affairs  quality assurance  quality control and research and development are classified as research and development costs 
research and development spending for past periods is not indicative of spending in future periods 
years ended december  research development costs direct external periodontal orthopedic sports medicine internal periodontal orthopedic sports medicine total we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we expand our operations  facilities and other administrative activities related to our efforts to bring our product candidates into commercialization 
since inception  we have incurred losses from operations each year 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  which includes a million impairment loss on auction rate securities and a million net gain on the january sale of our orofacial therapeutic business 
although the size and timing of our future operating losses are subject to significant uncertainty  we expect that operating losses  excluding the impairment loss on marketable securities and the gain on sale of our orofacial therapeutic business  may continue over the next few years as we continue to fund our research and development activities and clinical trials and as we prepare for a future sales network to represent our products 
also  given the sale of our remaining orofacial therapeutic business  we do not have an fda approved product in commercialization 
even with the cost reduction measures discussed in overview  the successful development of augment or any of our other product candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development and approval of  or the period in which material net cash flows are expected to commence from  any of our product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  future clinical trial results  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the establishment of marketing  sales and distribution  the cost and timing associated with licensing  business relationships and similar arrangements  the cost and timing of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of augment and our other product candidates  
table of contents the timing and results of our pre clinical research programs  and the effects of competing technologies and market developments  and the industry demand and patient wellness behavior as businesses and individuals suffer from the current economic downturn 
any failure to complete the development of augment or any of our other product candidates in a timely manner  or any failure to successfully market and commercialize augment or any of our other product candidates  could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and some of the consequences of failing to do so  are set forth under item a risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses  fair valuation of inventory  valuation of any losses on purchase commitments  fair valuation of stock related to stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on authoritative literature and pronouncements  historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the results of our operations for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of the results of our operations for any other future period 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report  we believe that the following accounting policies relating to revenue recognition  research and development expense  inventory valuation  valuation of purchase commitments  accrued expenses and deferred liabilities  stock based compensation  income taxes and investments in marketable securities are significant and  therefore  important to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition we follow the revenue recognition criteria outlined in staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab  revenue recognition  emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf issue  and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas no 

product sales revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product to the customer 
accordingly  up front  non refundable license fees under agreements where we have an ongoing research and development commitment are amortized  on a straight line basis  over the performance period 
revenues from milestones are only recognized upon achievement of the milestone criteria 
milestone payments received for sublicense fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the sublicense 
revenues received for ongoing research and development activities under collaborative agreements are recognized as these activities are performed pursuant to the terms of the related agreements 
royalty revenues are received from our sublicensor in arrears based on sales by the sublicensor 
we recognize royalty income when we receive the sales information from luitpold 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
revenue related to grant awards is deferred and recognized as related research and development performance occurs

we evaluate payments made to suppliers and other vendors in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  and determine the appropriate accounting treatment based on the nature of the services provided  the contractual terms  and the timing of the obligation 
research and development costs include payments to third parties that specifically relate to augment and our other product candidates in clinical development  such as payments to contract research organizations  clinical investigators  manufacture of clinical material  product related consultants  contract manufacturer start up costs  manufacturing scale up costs  milestone payments and insurance premiums for clinical studies 
in addition  employee costs salaries  payroll taxes  benefits  and travel for employees of the manufacturing  regulatory affairs  clinical affairs  quality assurance  quality control  and research and development departments are classified as research and development costs 
we adopted emerging issues task force issue  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf issue  on january  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations as of and for the year ended december  inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of our actual cost or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review existing inventory quantities  expiration dates of existing inventory  and inventory purchase commitments with suppliers to evaluate a provision for excess  expired  obsolete and scrapped inventory based primarily on our historical usage and anticipated future usage 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated change in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
inventory is carried at the lower of cost first in  first out or net realizable value and consists primarily of the purchase of raw materials  shipping costs associated with the transportation of raw materials to the contract manufacturer  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of filled periodontal cups and syringes  kit packing fees  and quality control testing fees  less reserves for obsolescence  shrinkage  expired inventory and potential scrapping of product batches that may not be released for sale 
valuation of purchase commitments we have substantial firm purchase commitments with our suppliers related to our future inventory needs 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we assess the need for any provision for future losses associated with these future purchase commitments in accordance with accounting research bulletin arb no 
 restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins 
as of december   no reserves have been recorded associated with these future purchase commitments 
accrued expenses and deferred liabilities as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate expenses that we have incurred for which we have not been invoiced 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed by third parties and the associated cost incurred for such services where we have not been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs 
examples of expenses for which we accrue based on estimates include milestones payable  salaries and wages  unpaid vacation and sick pay  fees for services  such as those provided by clinical research and data management organizations  investigators and fees owed to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the manufacture of clinical trial materials 
in connection with such service fees  these estimates are most affected by management s projections of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under estimate or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
management makes these estimates based upon 
table of contents the facts and circumstances known to it at the time and in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation during  our board of directors approved the adoption of the long term stock incentive plan the option plan 
the option plan provides that stock options  other equity interests or equity based incentives in our company may be granted to key personnel at an exercise price determined by our compensation committee  at the time the option is granted  taking into account the fair value of the common stock at the date of grant 
the maximum term of any option granted pursuant to the option plan is ten years from the date of grant 
the stock options we granted to our employees are structured to qualify as incentive stock options isos 
under current tax regulations  we do not receive a tax deduction for the issuance  exercise or disposition of isos if the employee meets specific holding requirements 
if the employee does not meet the holding requirements  a disqualifying disposition occurs  at which time we will receive a tax deduction 
we do not record tax benefits related to isos unless and until a disqualifying disposition occurs 
in the event of a disqualifying disposition  the entire tax benefit is recorded as a reduction of income tax expense 
we have not recognized any income tax benefit for share based compensation arrangements due to the fact that we do not believe that we will recognize any deferred tax assets from such compensation cost recognized in the current period 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no

in accordance with sfas no 
r  the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions amortized to expense over the options vesting periods for the year ended december  risk free interest rate of  expected dividend yield of  volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock of  forfeiture rate of and weighted average expected life of the option of years 
since the trading market for our common stock has a limited history  the expected volatility rates are based on historical data from three companies similar in size and value to our company 
the expected terms of options granted represent the period of time that options granted are estimated to be outstanding and are derived from the contractual terms of the options granted 
we amortize the fair value of each option over each option s vesting period 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
our net loss for the years ended december   and includes compensation costs of million  million and million  respectively  related to our stock based compensation arrangements 
no income tax benefit related to our stock based compensation arrangement is included in our net losses

 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided for the deferred tax assets related to future years  including loss carryforwards  if there is not sufficient evidence to indicate that the results of operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax asset in future years 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  to account for uncertain tax positions 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation prescribes that we should use a more likely than not recognition threshold 
table of contents based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as a result of adopting fin  we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities  or any associated amounts for interest and penalties

the majority of the student loans are guaranteed by the us department of education at amounts representing a substantial portion of the loans 
our ars investments include interest rates which reset regularly at pre determined intervals  typically days  through an auction process 
however  auctions for these ars investments have failed since february  and we have not been able to sell them 
consequently  fair value measures have been estimated using cash flow discounting with a monte carlo simulation 
the valuation model considers factors reflecting assumptions that market participants would use in pricing  including among others  the collateralization underlying the ars investments  the creditworthiness of the counterparty  the expected future cash flows  and the risks associated with uncertainties in the current market 
the ars investments are stated at fair market value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses and declines in market value judged to be other than temporary on investments in marketable securities are included in investment loss income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the cost of ars investments sold is based on the specific identification method 
interest and dividends on ars investments are included in investment loss income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the ars investments are classified as long term because we do not anticipate liquidating them over the next twelve months 
see additional discussion regarding the liquidity of the ars investments in liquidity and capital resources 
our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  reflects a loss on our investment portfolio including realized gains and losses of million  which includes an other than temporary impairment loss of million on ars investments classified as available for sale 
at december   we had accrued interest receivable of million related to our ars investments 
results of operations years ended december  and net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  we anticipate that our operating losses  which are only partially offset by revenues from royalty income  sublicense fee income and investment income  may continue over the next few years as we continue to fund our research and development activities and clinical trials and as we prepare for a future sales network to represent our products 

table of contents disposal of orofacial therapeutic business in january  we sold our orofacial therapeutic business gem s to luitpold 
as a result  we recorded a million net gain on the transaction

under the terms of the sale agreement  we expect to receive an additional million time based payment due in cash by the end of at december   we had recorded a receivable for million  which represents the discounted balance of the million due from luitpold 
we recorded million of interest income from the accretion of the receivable during the year ended december  furthermore  we expect to receive ongoing royalty payments based on net sales of gem s and other products that are based on adapting the company s technology to future products in the orofacial therapeutic field

royalty expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase  which results from minimum royalty payment requirements set forth in our patent licensing agreements  was offset by an increase in royalty income received to reimburse us for royalty expenses paid to third parties in excess of the royalty income already received 
stock compensation expense was million in the general and administrative functions for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in this increase is due to the expense related to a total of  new stock options awarded in at a weighted average exercise price of per share

we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders 
we have invested our net proceeds from the offering in student loan backed auction rate securities ars with aaa  aa and a credit ratings 
in january  we completed the sale to luitpold of our remaining orofacial therapeutic business  including the downstream formulation  fill  finish  manufacturing and kitting of gem s 
as of december   we have received million in cash as a result of the transaction  plus million in cash from the sale of existing inventory 
under the terms of the sale agreement  we expect to receive an additional million time based payment due in cash by the end of as well as ongoing royalty payments based on net sales of gem s and other products that are based on adapting our technology to future products in the orofacial therapeuctic field 
we further expect to receive a million milestone payment based upon the future anticipated eu regulatory approval of gem s as pre established in a prior agreement between us and luitpold 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents held in three financial institutions 
our excess cash reserves are invested in overnight sweep accounts  operating accounts and money market accounts 
in addition to the balance of cash and cash equivalents as of december   we had million in short term investments consisting of gse securities totaling million and a us treasury note totaling million that are classified as available for sale 
the gse securities have maturity dates from march through november the us treasury note has a maturity of april  also as of december   we had long term investments of million in student loan backed ars investments that are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
a total of million of our ars investments are bonds with a credit rating of aaa and million are bonds with a credit rating of aa or a generally  the ars investments are sold by state guarantee agencies backed by student loans under the ffelp 
the majority of the student loans are guaranteed by the us department of education at amounts representing a substantial portion of the loans 
we intend to hold these ars investments for at least the next twelve months 
accordingly  these ars investments have been classified as long term 
auctions for these ars investments have failed since february  and we have not been able to sell them 
the current economic downturn and the related uncertainty in the markets have negatively impacted our ability to resolve the liquidity issues of these ars investments  providing us with no guarantee that the market will reform or that our ars investments will be liquidated in a timely manner 
consequently  fair value measures have been estimated using cash flow discounting with a monte carlo simulation and other information 
the valuation model reflects various assumptions that market participants would use in pricing  including among others  the collateralization underlying the investments  the creditworthiness of the counterparty  the expected future cash flows  and the risks associated with uncertainties in the current market 
as a result of the other than temporary impairment in fair value of our ars investments  we recorded a loss on investments of million  which is reflected on our consolidated statement of operations at december  to address the liquidity issues associated with these ars investments in the short term  in october we entered into a time promissory note note credit facility with deutsche bank enabling us to borrow up to million with certain of our ars investments serving as collateral 
we granted deutsche bank a first priority security interest in certain of our ars investments having a total combined par value of million as collateral 
under the terms of the note  we are required to make monthly interest payments during the two year term of the note 
all outstanding principal amounts are due and payable in full on the maturity date in october we may elect to pay back the full principal amount prior to the maturity date with no penalty 
absent a biomimetic default or a sale of part of the collateral ars investments  deutsche bank has no ability to withdraw  reduce or change the terms of the note 
under the terms of the note  and at our option  the interest rate will be based on either libor plus or deutsche bank s 
table of contents prime rate minus 
the note also provides that in the event that deutsche bank later offers an ars lending program or settlement loan program to institutional clients that includes either a lower interest rate or permits borrowing of more than of the par value of the collateral securities  then the terms of our note and any existing loans issued under the note will be modified to include the lower interest rate or higher borrowing base 
we believe that the december  balance of our cash and investments  the funds borrowed from our million credit facility  and the expected million in time based payments to be received in from luitpold will be sufficient to fund our business operations through at least the first quarter of we expect to devote substantial resources to continue our research and development efforts  including clinical trials 
clinical study costs are comprised of payments for work performed by contract research organizations  universities and hospitals 
because of the significant time it will take for augment or our other product candidates to complete the clinical trial process  obtain approval from regulatory authorities and successfully commercialize our products  we may require substantial additional capital resources 
we may raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  corporate collaborations or other means 
we may attempt to raise additional capital due to favorable market conditions or other strategic considerations even if we have sufficient funds for planned operations 
to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuance of equity securities  our stockholders will experience dilution  and debt financings  if available  may involve restrictive covenants or may otherwise constrain our financial flexibility 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaborative arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our intellectual property or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
in addition  payments made by potential collaborators or licensors generally will depend upon our achievement of negotiated development and regulatory milestones 
failure to achieve these milestones may harm our future capital position 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
capital may become difficult or impossible to obtain due to poor market or other conditions outside of our control 
if at any time sufficient capital is not available  either through existing capital resources or through raising additional funds  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our research  pre clinical or clinical programs 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million  primarily consisting of salaries  clinical trials  research and development activities and general corporate operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  and included the net proceeds from the disposal of our orofacial therapeutic business and the related assets held for sale  offset by the net purchases of investments  capitalized patent costs  and engineering design and planning costs for the new manufacturing facility at our corporate headquarters 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of million in net proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock compensation plans and million in funds borrowed under the deutsche bank credit facility 
seasonality in january  we completed a transaction to sell our remaining orofacial therapeutic business to luitpold  including the downstream formulation  fill  finish manufacturing and kitting rights to gem s 
as a result of the sale  we do not expect product sales revenues from gem s in and going forward  however  we expect to continue to receive ongoing royalty payments based on net sales of gem s and other products that are based on adapting our technology to future products in the orofacial therapeutic field 
prior to the january sale  the manufacturing and supply agreement with luitpold obligated luitpold to purchase all of its requirements for gem s from us and we were obligated to meet such requirements to the extent they were consistent with luitpold s forecasts 
the cyclical nature of these purchase commitments triggered product sales of gem s for us primarily in the third and fourth quarters  with a lower portion of product sales recognized in the first and second quarters 
segment information we have determined that we are principally engaged in one operating segment 
our product development efforts are primarily in the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries and diseases  including
