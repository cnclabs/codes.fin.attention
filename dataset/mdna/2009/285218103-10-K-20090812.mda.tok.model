the information appearing under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report is hereby incorporated by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we could be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents interest rate and market risk 
while we have the ability to draw on our revolving credit line  we have not had any borrowings under that credit facility for several years 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
except for our auction rate securities ars  none of our investments are held for trading purposes 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of high quality securities  including direct obligations of the united states government  securities issued by agencies of the united states government  aaa rated money market or cash management funds  corporate and government bond funds and ars 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates by would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
at may   we had million  at cost  invested in corporate and government bond funds  which were classified as investments available for sale 
our investments available for sale are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at may   we had gross unrealized gains on our available for sale investments of million 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our available for sale investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates by would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
at may   we held million  at cost  of ars 
although our ars became illiquid beginning in february  we continue to earn and receive interest on our ars at a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indexes 
a majority of our ars investments mature in to years 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record further impairment charges on these investments 
at may   ubs ag ubs provided a valuation for the ars investments utilizing a discounted cash flow model 
based on this valuation  we valued the ars investments at million  which represents a decline in value of million from par 
the model weights various factors  including assessments of credit quality  duration  insurance wraps  portfolio composition  discount rates  overall capital market liquidity and comparable securities  if any 
the assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change  and therefore could result in significant changes to the fair value of ars 
we entered into an arrangement the rights with ubs under which we can require ubs to purchase our ars at par value  which is defined as the price equal to the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  at any time between june  and july  conversely  ubs has the right  in its discretion  to purchase or sell our ars at any time until july   so long as we receive a payment at par value upon any sale or disposition 
we expect to sell our ars under the rights 
in addition  ubs bank usa has established a credit line for us in an amount up to of the market value of the ars that we pledge as collateral  with interest equal to the interest income that we receive on our ars investments 
we have not drawn any amounts under this line and have no current plans to do so 
ubs s obligations under the rights are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the rights 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the rights 
the enforceability of the rights resulted in a put option  recognized as a free standing asset separate from the ars 
we recorded million as the fair value of the put option  included in interest income  net  in our consolidated financial statements 
although a change in interest rates will affect the fair value of our ars and put option  we expect that future changes in the fair value of the put option will approximate fair value movements in the related ars with no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents changes in foreign currencies 
we have wholly owned chinese and european subsidiaries 
in addition  we have revenues  cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable in other foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar 
our international operations subject us to foreign currency risks ie  the possibility that the financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
during fiscal we began using forward contracts to hedge our economic exposure with respect to assets  liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
in fiscal  we included million of net foreign currency transaction losses in consolidated net income due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations prior to the time we put our hedging strategies in place 
although there can be no assurances  given the extent of our international operations and our hedging  we do not expect a change in foreign currency rates to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet
