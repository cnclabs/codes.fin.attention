overview of operating results we are a leading designer  developer and manufacturer of a wide range of semiconductor products and intellectual property ip products 
our diversified product portfolio includes our proprietary avr microcontrollers  security and smart card integrated circuits  and a diverse range of advanced logic  mixed signal  nonvolatile memory and radio frequency devices 
leveraging our broad ip portfolio  we are able to provide our customers with complete system solutions 
our solutions target a wide range of applications in the industrial  consumer electronics  automotive  wireless  communications  computing  storage  security  military and aerospace markets  and are used 
table of contents in products such as mobile handsets  automotive electronics  global positioning systems gps and batteries 
we design  develop  manufacture and sell our products 
we develop process technologies to ensure our products provide the maximum possible performance 
in the year ended december   we manufactured approximately of our products in our own wafer fabrication facilities 
our operating segments consist of the following microcontroller products microcontroller  nonvolatile memory products nonvolatile memory  radio frequency and automotive products rf and automotive  and application specific integrated circuits asics 
net revenues decreased to  million in the year ended december  from  million in the year ended december   a decrease of million  as global economic weakness translated to customers pushing out or cancelling orders as a result of their own reduced demand 
the decrease in net revenues in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a decrease of million in our rf and automotive segment net revenues primarily as a result of reduced shipments for bicmos foundry products related to communication chipsets for code division multiple access cdma phones of million 
asic segment net revenues decreased million in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in our custom asic products of million 
non volatile memory segment net revenue decreased million in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to reduced demand and lower pricing for serial eeprom and serial flash products 
in addition  our net revenues decreased by an estimated million due to the conversion of certain european distributors to a sell through revenue model 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in microcontroller segment net revenues of million primarily due to an increase in avr net revenues of million  or  and our expanding bit microcontroller business of million  or  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  during the six months ended june   our sales agreements with independent distributors in europe were accounted for using a sell in revenue recognition model 
sales to these distributors before july  were made under arrangements where pricing was fixed at the time of shipment 
in addition  the arrangements did not provide these distributors with allowances such as price protection or right of return upon termination of the agreement 
as a result  our policy was to recognize revenue upon shipment to these distributors 
effective july   we entered into revised agreements with certain european distributors that allow additional rights  including future price concessions at the time of resale  price protection  and the right to return products upon termination of the distribution agreement 
as a result of uncertainties over finalization of pricing for shipments to these distributors  revenues and related costs will be deferred until the products are sold by the distributors to their end customers 
we consider that the sale prices are not fixed or determinable at the time of shipment to these distributors 
the objective of the conversion to this sell through revenue recognition model is to enable us to better manage end customer pricing  track design registrations for proprietary products  and improve our visibility into distribution inventory and sales levels 
we expect that this conversion will result in improved operating results for us and our distribution partners in the future 
management estimates that the impact of this one time change lowered net revenues and cost of revenues by million and million  respectively  in the year ended december  gross margin improved to in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  the improvement to gross margin has been driven primarily by our strategic restructuring initiatives which included the closure of our north tyneside fab  process and cost improvements in our rousset fab and a stronger mix of higher margin microcontroller and other core products 
we continue to take significant actions to improve operational efficiencies and further reduce costs 
during the years ended december  and  we incurred million and million  respectively  in restructuring charges related to headcount reductions in our manufacturing operations that we expect will result in lower costs of revenue beginning in the first quarter of we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the sale of our manufacturing operations in heilbronn  germany in the year ended december  and a gain of million on the sale of assets related to north tyneside  united kingdom facilities  which were sold during the year 

table of contents provision for income taxes totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  compared to million at december  our total debt decreased to million at december  from million at december  due to debt repayments of million 
our current liabilities decreased to million at december  from million at december  on march   we acquired quantum research group ltd 
quantum for an initial purchase price of million  subsequently increased to million due to contingent consideration earned 
the results of operations of quantum are included in our microcontroller segment from the date of acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of  the global economy continued to weaken and the semiconductor industry suffered one of its worst declines on record 
therefore  we have taken actions to continue to focus on high growth  high margin products as well as to reduce our cost structure 
these actions included divesting or closing over product lines  reducing our wafer fab facilities from five to two and reducing our total headcount from approximately  to  or over 
in response to the severe economic conditions  we are taking numerous actions to reduce our expenses and cash break even point 
we are proposing to accelerate activities to consolidate some of our back end test operations during to further reduce our manufacturing costs 
we have instituted tighter control discretionary spending and selective hiring for critical positions only 
furthermore  we have taken or plan to take the following major actions two week wafer manufacturing shutdown worldwide in the first quarter of  one week leave for non manufacturing employees in the first quarter of and one week in the second quarter of  salary cut for our chief executive officer and for the remaining executive team  salary freeze for the rest of our workforce  and suspension of our k match program

table of contents net revenues net revenues decreased to  million in the year ended december  from  million in the year ended december   a decrease of million  as global economic weakness translated to customers pushing out or cancelling orders as a result of their own reduced demand 
the decrease in net revenues in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a decrease of million in our rf and automotive segment net revenues primarily as a result of reduced shipments for bicmos foundry products related to communication chipsets for code division multiple access cdma phones of million 
asic segment net revenues decreased million in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in our custom asic products of million 
non volatile memory segment net revenue decreased million in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to reduced demand and lower pricing for serial eeprom and serial flash products 
in addition  our net revenues decreased by an estimated million due to the conversion of certain european distributors to a sell through revenue model 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in microcontroller segment net revenues of million primarily due to an increase in avr net revenues of million  or  and our expanding bit microcontroller business of million  or  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net revenues decreased to  million in the year ended december  from  million in the year ended december   a decrease of million  primarily as a result of declines in our rf and automotive and asic segments  partially offset by growth in our microcontroller segment 
net revenues for our asic and nonvolatile memory segments remained flat or declined slightly during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in net revenues in the rf and automotive segment is primarily due to a decrease in net revenues of million for bicmos foundry products related to a decline in orders from a significant customer for communication chipsets for cdma phones 
the decrease in net revenues in the asic segment is primarily due to reduced shipments of lower margin commodity telecommunication market products 
microcontroller segment revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of from the million reported for the year ended december  our proprietary avr microcontroller product revenues were million during  up from million recorded in the increase in revenues for microcontrollers were driven by significant new designs in consumer  wireless handset  and industrial market applications 
average exchange rates utilized to translate foreign currency net revenues in euro were approximately and euro to the dollar in the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   changes in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on net revenues 
had average exchange rates remained the same during the year ended december  as the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december   our reported net revenues for the year ended december  would have been million lower 
net revenues by operating segment our net revenues by operating segment are summarized as follows in thousands  except percentages of net change change segment revenues from from in thousands  except percentage of net revenues microcontroller nonvolatile memory rf and automotive asic net revenues 
table of contents of net change change segment revenues from from microcontroller nonvolatile memory rf and automotive asic net revenues of net segment revenues microcontroller nonvolatile memory rf and automotive asic net revenues net revenues for the year ended december  have been adjusted to reflect the divestiture of our grenoble  france  subsidiary 
net revenues from the grenoble subsidiary of million for the year ended december  are excluded from consolidated net revenues and are reclassified to results from discontinued operations 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion 
microcontroller microcontroller segment net revenues increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to new customer designs utilizing our proprietary avr microcontroller products  our new qtouch touchscreen products  and our arm based microcontroller products 
avr microcontroller revenue grew million or in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  arm based microcontroller products revenue increased million or in the year ended december  from the year ended december  net revenues for microcontroller products have increased due to gains in the bit microcontroller market and arm based microcontrollers  growth in the overall microcontroller market including recent high volume customer applications in the consumer and industrial markets  and improved delivery times resulting from higher inventory levels 
our bit microcontroller business also grew in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  overall demand for microcontrollers is driven by increased use of embedded control systems in consumer  industrial and automotive products 
on a non gaap basis  microcontroller net revenues would have increased by approximately or million to million in the year ended december   after considering an adjustment of million for the estimated impact of the conversion of certain european distributors to a sell through revenue model in the year ended december  to supplement our microcontroller segment financial results presented in accordance with gaap  the preceding sentence includes non gaap microcontroller segment net revenues for the year ended december   which are adjusted from microcontroller segment net revenues presented in accordance with gaap to exclude the adjustment of million related to the conversion of certain distributors in europe to a sell through model 
management believes that this non gaap financial measure reflects an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results  provides a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting our business and operations 
we have used non gaap microcontroller segment net revenues in the year ended december  for internal purposes and believes that this non gaap financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance 
management uses this non gaap financial measure for strategic and business decision making  internal budgeting  forecasting and resource allocation processes 

table of contents we believe that providing this non gaap financial measure  in addition to the gaap financial results  is useful to investors because the non gaap financial measure allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management as this non gaap financial measure reflects our internal measurement processes 
management believes that this non gaap financial measure enables investors to better assess changes in a key element of our operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis 
thus  management believes that this non gaap financial measure provides investors with another method for assessing our operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of our ongoing operations 
in addition  this non gaap financial measure facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results and to competitors operating results 
there are limitations in using non gaap financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
in addition  non gaap financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results 
management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
the presentation of non gaap financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
non gaap financial measures supplement  and should be viewed in conjunction with  gaap financial measures 
microcontroller segment net revenues increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to new customer designs utilizing both our proprietary avr microcontroller products as well as our arm based microcontroller products 
avr microcontroller revenue grew million or in the year ended december   compared to results for the year ended december  arm based microcontroller products revenue increased million or in the year ended december  from the year ended december  net revenues for microcontroller products increased due to gains in the bit microcontroller market and arm based microcontrollers  growth in the overall microcontroller market including recent high volume customer applications in the consumer and industrial markets  and improved delivery times resulting from higher inventory levels and increased test capacity added during the first half of overall demand for microcontrollers is driven by increased use of embedded control systems in consumer  industrial and automotive products 
nonvolatile memory nonvolatile memory segment net revenues decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a reduction of serial eeprom and serial flash product sales due to reduced demand and increased pricing pressure 
market for our nonvolatile memory products are more competitive than other markets we sell in  and as a result  our memory products are subject to greater declines in average selling prices than products in our other segments 
nonvolatile memory segment net revenues increased less than to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  within this segment  revenues increased million or for serial eeprom based product revenues and million or in serial flash product revenues  partially offset by reduced shipments of lower margin commodity flash memory products  which decreased revenues by million or 
markets for our nonvolatile memory products are more competitive than many other markets we sell in  and as a result  our memory products are subject to greater declines in average selling prices compared to product pricing in our other segments 
competitive pressures and rapid obsolescence of products are among several factors that caused continued pricing declines in while pricing for serial eeprom based products remained steady  unit shipments increased by  compared to unit shipments for the year ended december  rf and automotive rf and automotive segment net revenues decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to reduced shipment quantities for bicmos foundry products related to communication chipsets for cdma phones and other automotive products 
net revenues for bicmos foundry products decreased million or and other

table of contents our net revenues in europe decreased million  or less than  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to lower volume shipments of smart card and automotive products 
our net revenues in europe increased million  or  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to both higher volume shipments of arm based microcontrollers and automotive products  partially offset by reductions in smartcard shipments 
our net revenues in the united states increased by million  or  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  and decreased million  or in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to united states based customers continuing to redirect deliveries from domestic operations to lower cost overseas operations  as well as reduced shipments to united states based distributors 
while revenues in asia declined in compared to and declined in compared to  we expect that asia revenues will grow more rapidly than other regions in the future 
revenues in asia may be impacted in the future as we refine our distribution strategy and optimize our distributor base in asia 
it may take time for us to identify financially viable distributors and help them develop high quality support services 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to manage this optimization process in an efficient and timely manner 
revenues and costs impact from changes to foreign exchange rates changes in foreign exchange rates  primarily the euro  have had a significant impact on our net revenues and operating costs

table of contents cost of revenues and gross margin we develop our own manufacturing process technologies to ensure our products provide the maximum possible performance 
in the year ended december   we manufactured approximately of our products in our own wafer fabrication facilities 
our cost of revenues includes the costs of wafer fabrication  assembly and test operations  changes in inventory reserves and freight costs 
our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues fluctuates depending on product mix  manufacturing yields  utilization of manufacturing capacity  and average selling prices  among other factors 
gross margin improved to in the year ended december   compared to and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the improvement in gross margin has been driven primarily by our strategic restructuring initiatives which included the closure of our north tyneside  uk fab  process and cost improvements in our rousset fab and a stronger mix of higher margin microcontroller and other core products 
manufacturing utilization improvements result primarily from higher production levels at our colorado springs  united states and rousset  france fabrication facilities following the closure of our north tyneside  uk facility in the second quarter of our gross margin for the year ended december  was also favorably impacted by a million pension benefit adjustment  which decreased cost of revenues  related to the reduction of pension liability and the release of the related accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the sale of our manufacturing operations in heilbronn  germany  which was completed in december gross margin improvements in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily resulted from lower depreciation expense related to our decision to sell our north tyneside  uk facility  as well as a more favorable mix of higher margin products sold  and improved manufacturing yields 
however  our gross margins were negatively impacted in the year ended december  by a significant change in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar weakening when compared to the euro as well as lower factory utilization rates  primarily for our north tyneside  uk facility 
gross margin was also impacted by higher inventory write downs of million in the year ended december   compared to million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively

stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award which is computed using a black scholes option valuation model  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service

the fair value of a restricted stock unit is equivalent to the market price of our common stock on the measurement date 
stock based compensation expense under sfas r was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense increased in the year ended december  primarily due to annual stock option and restricted stock unit replenishment grants  performance based restricted stock units and retention awards for certain key executives and employees 
charges for grant repayments in the fourth quarter of  we announced our intention to close our design facility in greece and sell our manufacturing facility in north tyneside  united kingdom 
we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of associated with the expected repayment of subsidy grants previously received and recognized related to grant agreements with government agencies at these locations 
the proceeds of the subsidy grants were originally recorded as either a reduction of cost of revenues or research and development expense when they were recognized during the period from to these grant repayments were repaid in full in january in each of the years ended december  and  we recorded additional accrued interest of million related to grant repayments for other grant proceeds which are expected to be repaid in future periods 
all of these charges have been included in charges for grant repayments in the consolidated statements of operations 
we receive economic incentive grants and allowances from european governments targeted at increasing employment at specific locations 
the subsidy grant agreements typically contain economic incentive and other covenants that must be met to receive and retain grant benefits 
noncompliance with the conditions of the grants could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received  as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 
in addition  we may need to record charges to reverse grant benefits recorded in prior periods as a result of changes to our plans for headcount  project spending  or capital investment at any of these specific locations 
if we are unable to comply with any of the covenants in the grant agreements  our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected

asset impairment charges recovery and gain on sale of assets under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 we assess the recoverability of long lived assets with finite useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
we measure the amount of impairment of such long lived assets by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair market value of the asset  which is generally determined based on projected discounted future cash flows or appraised values

interest and other expenses income  net  improved to million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  this improvement resulted primarily from a reduction to long term debt levels  as well as a gain from sale of excess land of million in the year ended december  interest and other expenses income  net  also improved as a result of reduced losses of million in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  related to foreign exchange transactions

approximately million of income tax expense in results from taxes incurred by our foreign subsidiaries which are profitable on a statutory basis for tax purposes and an increase in provision for tax settlements related to certain us federal  state and foreign tax liabilities 
at december   there was no provision for us income tax for undistributed earnings  as it was our intention to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the us for the year ended december   we changed our position to no longer assert permanent reinvestment of undistributed earnings for certain foreign entities 
as of december   there was no us income tax provision for undistributed earnings of approximately million as it is currently our intention to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the us the determination of the tax effect of repatriating these earnings in the foreseeable future is not practicable 

table of contents at december   we had net operating loss carry forwards in non us jurisdictions of approximately million 
these loss carry forwards expire in different periods starting in we also had us federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively  at december  these loss carry forwards expire in different periods from through we also have us federal and state tax credits of approximately million and million  respectively at december  us federal credits will expire beginning in  and state credits will expire beginning in the emergency economic stabilization act of  which contained the tax extenders and alternative minimum tax relief act of  was signed into law on october  under the act  the federal tax research credit was retroactively extended for amounts paid or incurred after december  and before january  the effect of this change resulted in an increase to our deferred tax assets with a corresponding increase to the valuation allowance 
on september   california enacted assembly bill which among other provisions  suspends net operating loss deductions for and and limits the utilization of tax credits to percent of a taxpayer s taxable income 
this new tax law did not have any impact on the tax provision 
during the year  we sold our fabrication facility and incurred restructuring charges related to a foreign subsidiary as well as incurring in process research and development costs in the united kingdom 
due to a full valuation allowance position in this jurisdiction  there was no tax provision impact associated with these events 
on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on income tax expense must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
upon review of our reserves  there were no changes to its reserves for uncertain tax positions upon adoption 
at the adoption date of january  we had million of recognized tax benefits 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits  of which million would affect income tax expense if recognized 
the remainder would affect the tax rate in the form of deferred tax assets  which would attract a full valuation allowance 
during the year  as a result of on going discussions with foreign tax authorities related to open audits  we remeasured our fin reserves and recorded an adjustment to unrecognized tax benefits of million 
this adjustment was a decrease to foreign net operating loss carry forwards with a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance 
this change has no impact on income tax provision 
in  the internal revenue service irs completed its audit of our us income tax returns for the years and and has proposed various adjustments to these income tax returns  including carry back adjustments to and in january  after subsequent discussions with us  the irs revised their proposed adjustments for these years 
we have protested these proposed adjustments and are currently working through the matter with the irs appeals division 
in may  the irs completed its audit of our us income tax returns for the years and and has proposed various adjustments to these income tax returns 
we have protested all of these proposed adjustments and we are currently working through the matters with the irs appeals division 
the income tax returns for our subsidiary in rousset  france for the through tax years are currently under examination by the french tax authorities 
the examination has resulted in a significant income tax assessment and we are currently pursuing administrative appeal of the assessment 
in addition  we have tax audits in progress in other foreign jurisdictions 
while we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position  the outcome is subject to significant uncertainties 
we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
to the extent the final tax liabilities are different than the amounts originally accrued  the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes and related interest and penalties due for potential adjustments may result from the resolution of these examinations  and examinations of open us federal  state and foreign tax years 

table of contents discontinued operations grenoble  france subsidiary sale in july  we completed the sale of our grenoble  france  subsidiary to ev technologies plc  a british corporation ev 
on august   we received million in cash upon closing million  net of working capital adjustments and costs of disposition 
the grenoble facility was originally acquired by us in may from thomson csf  and performed the manufacturing of image sensors  as well as analog  digital and radio frequency asics 
technology rights and certain assets related to biometry or finger chip technology were excluded from the sale 
as of july   the facility employed a total of employees  of which employees primarily involved with the finger chip technology were retained  and the remaining employees were transferred to ev 
in connection with the sale  atmel agreed to provide certain technical support  foundry  distribution and other services extending up to four years following the completion of the sale  and in turn ev has agreed to provide certain design and other services to atmel extending up to five years following the completion of the sale 
the financial statement impact of these agreements is not expected to be material to us 
the ongoing cash flows between us and ev are not significant and as a result  we have no significant continuing involvement in the operations of the subsidiary 
therefore  we have met the criteria in sfas no 
 which were necessary to classify the grenoble  france  subsidiary as discontinued operations

our current ratio  calculated as total current assets divided by total current liabilities  was at december   an increase of from at december  during  we generated positive cash flow from operating activities of million 
we have reduced our debt obligations to million at december  from million at december   a decrease of million 
working capital  calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities  increased by million to million at december   compared to million at december   primarily due to cash provided by operating activities 
approximately million of our long term investment portfolio at december  is invested in auction rate securities  compared to million at december  in the year ended december   approximately million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par value 
these auction rate securities were reclassified as long term investments within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of december   as they are not expected to be liquidated within the next twelve months 
in october  we accepted an offer from ubs financial services inc ubs to purchase our eligible auction rate securities of million at par value at any time during a two year time period from june  to july  as a result of this offer  we expect to sell the securities to ubs at par value on june  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  in the year ended december   cash flows from operations were significantly reduced by payments related to restructuring  facility sales  and other non recurring items 
restructuring payments in the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million in the year ended december  payments related to the closure of our north tyneside  uk fabrication facility  following the termination of manufacturing activity  totaled million in the year ended december   including million paid to the uk government in january related to repayment of grant proceeds 

table of contents while these payments were offset by proceeds from the sale of equipment of million  these sale proceeds were classified as a cash inflow in the net cash used in investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  total cash paid related to these non recurring items totaled million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  accounts receivable decreased by or million to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to lower revenue in the average days of accounts receivable outstanding dso increased to days at december   compared to days at december  in the three months ended december   we recorded a one time bad debt charge of million related to an asian distributor whose business was impacted following their addition to the us department of commerce entity list  which prohibits us from shipping products to the distributor 
accounts receivable balances were also impacted by the change of certain european distributors to a sell through revenue model in initial shipments to distributors under a sell through revenue model are usually priced higher than under the terms previously offered  increasing reported accounts receivable balances 
the related revenue is deferred until our products are sold to the end customers  at which time the distributors typically claim a credit 
our accounts receivable and dso are primarily impacted by shipment linearity  payment terms offered  and collection performance 
should we need to offer longer payment terms in the future due to competitive pressures or longer customer payment patterns  our dso and cash flows from operating activities would be negatively affected 
decreases in inventories provided million of operating cash flows in the year ended december   compared to an increase in inventories of million in the year ended december  this reduction was primarily as a result of the closure of our north tyneside  uk fabrication facility in the first quarter of our days of inventory increased to days at december   compared to days at december   primarily due to higher inventory quantities as result of a significant drop in shipments in the fourth quarter of inventory balances were reduced by million in connection with the sale of heilbronn  germany manufacturing operations 
inventories consist of raw wafers  purchased specialty wafers  work in process and finished units 
we are continuing to take measures to reduce manufacturing cycle times and improve production planning efficiency 
however  the strategic need to offer competitive lead times may result in an increase in inventory levels in the future 
reduction of accounts payable balances utilized million of operating cash flows in the year ended december   which included million of grant repayment in connection with the sale of our north tyneside  uk facility  which was paid in the first quarter of investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  during the year ended december   we paid approximately million for the acquisition of quantum  net of cash acquired  and million for capital expenditures  offset in part by million we received from the sale of fabrication equipment from our north tyneside  uk facility 
we anticipate that expenditures for capital purchases will be between million and million for  which will be used to maintain existing equipment  provide additional testing capacity and  to a limited extent  for equipment to develop advanced process technologies 
on may   we sold our irving  tx wafer fabrication facility for proceeds of approximately million million  net of selling costs 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  we continued to pay down debt  with repayments of principal balances on capital leases and other debt totaling million in the year ended december   compared to million in year ended december  net proceeds from issuance of common stock totaled million for both the years ended december  and in august  we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program asr with third party investment banks and used million to repurchase our common stock 
in the year ended december   we received and retired approximately million shares under the 
table of contents asr arrangement  which reduced our shares outstanding as of december  the entire million was recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  equipment lease financing  and other short term and medium term bank borrowings  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements over the next twelve months 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million in the year ended december   compared to an increase of million in the year ended december   due to the effect of exchange rate changes on cash balances 
during the next twelve months  we expect our operations to generate positive cash flows 
we expect that we will have sufficient cash from operations and financing sources to meet all debt obligations 
debt obligations outstanding at december   which are classified as short term  totaled million 
during and future years  our capacity to make necessary capital investments will depend on our ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and on our ability to obtain adequate financing if necessary 
in the event that we cannot obtain adequate financing due to the current condition of the credit markets or have to pay down our million in lines of credit  we believe we have sufficient funds due to the million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments we held as of december  along with cash flows from operations  which amounted to million for the year ended december  on march   we entered into a five year asset backed credit facility for up to million with certain european lenders 
this facility is secured by our non us trade receivables 
at december   the amount available under this facility was million based on eligible non us trade receivables  of which  was outstanding 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at libor plus per annum approximately based on the two months libor at december   while the undrawn portion is subject to a commitment fee of per annum 
the outstanding balance is subject to repayment in full on the last day of its interest period every two months 
the terms of the facility subject us to certain financial and other covenants and cross default provisions 
we were in compliance with our covenants as of december  commitment fees and amortization of up front fees paid related to the facility for each of the years ended december   and totaled million  and are included in interest and other expense income  net  in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of january   our eligible non us trade receivables under this facility declined to approximately million which may require us to either repay a portion of the loan or utilize cash in a restricted account as additional collateral 
in december  we established a million revolving line of credit with a domestic bank  which has been extended until september the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is either lower of the domestic bank s prime rate approximately at december  or libor plus approximately based on the one month libor at december  
in september  we obtained a million term loan from the same bank  which matured at september  the revolving line of credit is secured by our us trade receivables and requires us to meet certain financial ratios and to comply with other covenants on a periodic basis 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december   at which date  the full million of the revolving line of credit was outstanding and is classified as bank lines of credit in the summary debt table 
in february  we repaid million under this line of credit as its eligible us trade receivables declined to approximately million

concurrent with the sale  we entered into a three year supply agreement with a subsidiary of xbybus sas  whereby we are required to purchase a minimum volume of wafers through as of december   less than million remains to be purchased under the original term of the agreement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
b this amount relates to the contractual obligation on a supply agreement that we entered into with the buyer of our manufacturing operations in heilbronn  germany facility 
the wafers are purchased at cost in euros  which represents the fair value at the time of purchase 
the commitment is equivalent to approximately million euros 
c we have an obligation to pay certain former quantum employees million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
d other long term obligations consist principally of future repayments of approximately million of advances from customers  and million of technology license payments 
long term advances from customers includes approximately million that is due within year  and has been classified within current liabilities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the balance is due in annual installments of million per year  until repaid in full 
e contains all restructuring liabilities as of december  the contractual obligation table excludes our fin liabilities of million because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of cash payments 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
approximately million of our total debt requires us to meet certain financial ratios and to comply with other covenants on a periodic basis  and they all have cross default provisions 
the financial ratio covenants include  but are not limited to  the maintenance of minimum cash balances and net worth  and debt to capitalization ratios 

table of contents there is no requirement to maintain a restricted cash balance 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  if we need to renegotiate any of these covenants in the future  and the lenders refuse and we are unable to comply with the covenants  then we may immediately be required to repay the loans concerned 
in the event we are required to repay these loans ahead of their due dates  we believe that we have the resources to make such repayments  but such payments could adversely impact our liquidity 
our ability to service long term debt in the us or to obtain cash for other needs from our foreign subsidiaries may be structurally impeded 
since a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through our foreign subsidiaries  our cash flow and ability to service debt are partially dependent upon the liquidity and earnings of our subsidiaries as well as the distribution of those earnings  or repayment of loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries  to the us parent corporation 
these foreign subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and may have limited or no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to pay any amount to us  whether by dividends  distributions  loans or other payments 
however  the us parent corporation owes much of our consolidated long term debt 
defined benefit pension plans we sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all french and german employees 
plan benefits are provided in accordance with local statutory requirements 
benefits are based on years of service and employee compensation levels 
the plans are non funded 
pension liabilities and charges to expense are based upon various assumptions  updated quarterly  including discount rates  future salary increases  employee turnover  and mortality rates 
retirement plans consist of two types of plans 
the first plan type provides for termination benefits paid to employees only at retirement  and consists of approximately one to five months of salary 
this structure covers our french employees 
the second plan type provides for defined benefit payouts for the remaining employee s post retirement life  and covers our german employees 
pension benefits payable totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash funding for benefits to be paid for is expected to be approximately million  and an additional million thereafter over the next years 
off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees in the ordinary course of business  we have investments in privately held companies  which we review to determine if they should be considered variable interest entities 
we have evaluated our investments in these privately held companies and have determined that there was no material impact on our operating results or financial condition upon our adoption of fasb interpretation no

fin r 
under fin r certain events can require a reassessment of our investments in privately held companies to determine if they are variable interest entities and which of the stakeholders will be the primary beneficiary 
as a result of such events  we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities 
we may be unable to influence these events 
during the ordinary course of business  we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either our subsidiaries or us 
as of december   the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these guarantee agreements is approximately million 
we have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements 
based on historical experience and information currently available  we believe we will not be required to make any payments under these guarantee arrangements

see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

table of contents revenue recognition we sell our products to oems and distributors and recognize revenue when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are estimated and re evaluated each reporting period 
contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
sales terms do not include post shipment obligations except for product warranty  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for sales to certain distributors primarily based in the us and from the third quarter of  europe with agreements allowing for price protection and product returns  we recognize revenue at the time the distributor sells the product to its end customer 
revenue is not recognized upon shipment since  due to price protection rights  the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time 
additionally  these distributors have contractual rights to return products  up to a specified amount for a given period of time 
revenue is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an end user  at which time the sales price becomes fixed 
at the time of shipment to these distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment  relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor  and record the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on the consolidated balance sheets 
this balance represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor  however  the amount of gross margin recognized by us in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions 
we do not reduce deferred margin by estimated price protection  instead  such price concessions are recorded when incurred  which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product to an end user 
deferred income on shipments to distributors were million and million at december  and  respectively 
sales to certain other primarily non us based distributors primarily based in asia carry either no or very limited rights of return 
we have historically been able to estimate returns and other credits from these distributors and accordingly have historically recognized revenue from sales to these distributors upon shipment  with a related allowance for potential returns established at the time of sale 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving accurate and timely data from our distributors 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
because the data set is large and complex and because there may be errors in the reported data  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
actual results could vary from those estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns we must make estimates of potential future product returns and revenue adjustments related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends in the semiconductor industry  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenues may result 
we provide for sales returns based on our customer experience and our expectations for revenue adjustments based on economic conditions within the semiconductor industry 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing specific customer creditworthiness  historical bad debts and current economic trends 
at december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million  respectively 
in the three months ended december   we recorded a bad debt charge of million related to an asian distributor whose business was impacted following their addition to the us department of commerce entity list  which prohibits us from shipping products to the distributor 

table of contents accounting for income taxes in calculating our income tax expense  it is necessary to make certain estimates and judgments for financial statement purposes that affect the recognition of tax assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would decrease income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
our income tax calculations are based on application of the respective us federal  state or foreign tax law 
atmel s tax filings  however  are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities 
accordingly  we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
to the extent the final tax liabilities are different than the amounts originally accrued  the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
valuation of inventory our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis for raw materials and purchased parts and an average cost basis for work in progress and finished goods or market 
cost includes labor  including stock based compensation costs  materials  depreciation and other overhead costs  as well as factors for estimated production yields and scrap 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  including average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods 
we primarily utilize selling prices in our period ending backlog for measuring any potential declines in market value below cost 
any adjustment for market value provision is charged to cost of revenues at the point of market value decline 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical and forecasted sales levels by product 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand are provided for 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence 
increases to the provision for excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of revenues 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower cost inventory is subsequently sold  the related provision is matched to the movement of related product inventory  resulting in lower costs and higher gross margins for those products 
our inventories include high technology parts that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs 
fixed assets we review the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and or disposition 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following i significant negative industry or economic trends  ii exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  iii current  historical or projected losses that demonstrated continuing losses associated with an asset  iv significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time relative to net book value  v recent changes in our manufacturing model  and vi management s assessment of future manufacturing capacity requirements 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of 
table of contents the assets 
the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions  which require our judgment  including  but not limited to  future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets  future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes 
in addition  we must use our judgment in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 
our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly underutilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand for semiconductors produced in those facilities 
we estimate the useful life of our manufacturing equipment  which is the largest component of our fixed assets  to be five years 
we base our estimate on our experience with acquiring  using and disposing of equipment over time 
depreciation expense is a major element of our manufacturing cost structure 
we begin depreciation on new equipment when it is put into use for production 
the aggregate amount of fixed assets under construction for which depreciation was not being recorded was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

purchased intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and forecasted operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
stock based compensation upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we reassessed our equity compensation valuation method and related assumptions 
our determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant utilizes an option pricing model  and is impacted by our common stock price as well as a change in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards  as well as the projected employee option exercise behaviors during the expected period between the stock option vesting date and the stock option exercise date 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value  in our opinion  the existing black scholes option pricing model may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas no 
r using an option pricing model that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
for performance based restricted stock units  we are required to assess the probability of achieving certain financial objectives at the end of each reporting period 
based on the assessment of this probability  which require judgment  we record stock based compensation expense  which may be reversed in future periods if we determine that it is no longer probable that the objectives will be achieved 
the fair value of a restricted stock unit is equivalent to the market price of our common stock on the measurement date 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and included a combination of payment awards granted prior to january  and payment awards granted subsequent to january  for stock based payment awards granted prior to january   we attribute the value of stock based compensation  determined under sfas no 
r  to expense using the accelerated multiple option approach 
compensation expense for all stock based payment awards granted 
table of contents subsequent to january  is recognized using the straight line single option method 
stock based compensation expense included in the years ended december   and includes the impact of estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for the periods prior to  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
the adoption of sfas no 
r requires us to reflect the net cumulative impact of estimating forfeitures in the determination of period expense by reversing the previously recognized cumulative compensation expense related to those forfeitures  rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted 
we did not record this cumulative impact upon adoption  as the amount was insignificant 
stock options granted in periods prior to were measured based on sfas no 
requirements  whereas stock options granted subsequent to january  were measured based on sfas no 
r requirements 
restructuring charges we have recorded accruals for restructuring costs related to the restructuring of operations 
the restructuring accruals include primarily payments to employees for severance  termination fees associated with leases  other contracts and other costs related to the closure of facilities 
accruals are recorded when management has approved a plan to restructure operations and a liability has been incurred 
the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded 
these estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded 
litigation the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we are currently involved in such intellectual property litigation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we accrue for losses related to litigation if a loss is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to determine whether accruals for litigation should be made 
if we were to determine that such a liability was probable and could be reasonably estimated  the adjustment would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
valuation of marketable securities our marketable securities include corporate debt securities  us government and municipal agency debt securities  commercial paper  guaranteed variable annuities and auction rate securities 
we monitor our investments for impairment periodically and recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of these investments is judged to be other than temporary 
significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  forecasted recovery  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
our investments also include certain highly rated auction rate securities  which are structured with short term interest rate reset dates of either or days and contractual maturities that can be in excess of ten years 
we evaluate our portfolio by continuing to monitor the credit rating  interest yields of these auction rate securities and successful reset at each auction date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities whose values are dependent upon short term interest rates 
we generally classify these securities as available for sale  and consequently record them on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses being recorded as a separate part of stockholders equity 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
given our current profile of interest rate exposures and the maturities of our investment holdings  we believe that an unfavorable change in interest rates would not have a significant negative impact on our investment portfolio or statements of operations through december  in addition  certain of our borrowings are at floating rates  so this would act as a natural hedge 

table of contents we have short term debt  long term debt and capital leases totaling million at december  approximately million of these borrowings have fixed interest rates 
we have approximately million of floating interest rate debt  of which approximately million is euro denominated 
we do not hedge against the risk of interest rate changes for our floating rate debt and could be negatively affected should these rates increase significantly 
while there can be no assurance that these rates will remain at current levels  we believe that any rate increase will not cause a significant adverse impact to our results of operations  cash flows or to our financial position 
the following table summarizes our variable rate debt exposed to interest rate risk as of december  all fair market values are shown net of applicable premium or discount  if any total variable rate debt payments by due year outstanding at thereafter december  in thousands day usd libor weighted average interest rate basis revolving line of credit due total of day usd libor rate debt day usd libor weighted average interest rate basis revolving line of credit total of day usd libor rate debt day euribor weighted average interest rate basis capital leases total of day euribor rate debt total variable rate debt actual interest rates include a spread over the basis amount 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in interest expense  for the year ended december  related to our outstanding borrowings that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  the modeling technique used measures the change in interest expense arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in yield  of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps

conversely  revenues will be positively impacted if the local currency strengthens against the dollar 
in europe  where our significant operations have costs denominated in european currencies  costs will decrease if the local currency weakens 
conversely  costs will increase if the local currency strengthens against the dollar 
the net effect of unfavorable exchange rates in the year ended december   compared to the average exchange rates in the 
table of contents year ended december   resulted in an increase in loss from operations of million 
this impact is determined assuming that all foreign currency denominated transactions that occurred in the year ended december  were recorded using the average foreign currency exchange rates in the same period in sales denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  were  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales denominated in yen were for the years ended december   and costs denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  were  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
average annual exchange rates utilized to translate foreign currency revenues and expenses in euro were approximately  and euro to the dollar in the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the year ended december   changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on operating costs and loss from operations 
had average exchange rates remained the same during the year ended december  as the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december   our reported revenues for the year ended december  would have been approximately million lower 
however  our foreign currency expenses exceed foreign currency revenues 
for the year ended december  and  and of our operating expenses  respectively  were denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
had average exchange rates for the year ended december  remained the same as the average exchange rates for year ended december   our operating expenses would have been approximately million lower cost of revenues of million  research and development expenses of million  and sales  general and administrative expenses of million 
the net effect resulted in an increase to loss from operations of approximately million in the year ended december  as a result of unfavorable exchange rates when compared to the year ended december  we expect to take additional actions in the future to reduce this exposure 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce the exposure to additional unfavorable changes to exchanges rates and the results on gross margin 
we face the risk that our accounts receivables denominated in foreign currencies will be devalued if such foreign currencies weaken quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately and of our accounts receivable were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 
we also face the risk that our accounts payable and debt obligations denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately and of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 
approximately and of our debt obligations were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 
liquidity and valuation risk approximately million of our long term investment portfolio at december  was invested in highly rated auction rate securities  compared to approximately million at december  in the year ended december   million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par value 
auction rate securities are securities that are structured with short term interest rate reset dates of generally less than ninety days but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
these securities are subject to fluctuations in fair value depending on the supply and demand at each auction 
if the auctions for the securities we own fail  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful 
if the credit rating of either the security issuer or the third party insurer underlying the investments deteriorates  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through an impairment charge 
in the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million related to a decline in the value of auction rate securities
