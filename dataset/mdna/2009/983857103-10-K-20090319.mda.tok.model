there have been no material changes in the company s policies or estimates since december  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in some instances  there may be alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
management maintains a thorough process to review the application of accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to the financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable allowances are based on known customer exposures  historic credit experience  and the specific identification of potentially uncollectible accounts 
in addition to known or judgmental components  a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivable is followed 
actual collections may differ  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  judgments are made as to future demand requirements and compared with current inventory levels 
reserves are established for excess and obsolete inventory based on material movement  market conditions  and technological advancements 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with benefits paid under employee health care programs 
the measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historic loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of costs per claim 
these costs are accounted for by developing estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred  including those claims incurred but not reported 
this method provides estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
long lived assets evaluations are periodically made of long lived assets for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that this risk may be present 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based 
table of contents on several factors including but not limited to  market conditions  operational performance  technological advancements  and estimated future cash flows

sfas requires companies to review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment occur 
impairment indicators could include a significant adverse change in the business climate  operating performance indicators  or the decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit 
the company is required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
a discounted cash flow method is used to establish the fair value of reporting units 
this model requires the use of estimates concerning discount rates and future cash flows of each reporting unit to determine estimated fair values 
an impairment charge is recognized for any amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment review consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount  the indefinite lived intangible asset is not considered impaired 
sfas also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no

changes in fair values of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are reported in earnings immediately
