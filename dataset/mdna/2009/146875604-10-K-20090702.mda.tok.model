item business 
overview carver bancorp  inc  a delaware corporation the holding company or carver  is the holding company for carver federal savings bank carver federal or the bank  a federally chartered savings bank  and  on a parent only basis  had minimal results of operations 
the holding company is headquartered in new york  new york 
the holding company conducts business as a unitary savings and loan holding company  and the principal business of the holding company consists of the operation of its wholly owned subsidiary  carver federal 
carver federal was founded in to serve african american communities whose residents  businesses and institutions had limited access to mainstream financial services 
the bank remains headquartered in harlem  and predominantly all its nine branches and eight stand alone atm centers are located in low to moderate income neighborhoods 
many of these historically underserved communities have experienced unprecedented growth and diversification of incomes  ethnicity and economic opportunity  after decades of public and private investment 
today  carver federal is the largest african american operated bank in the united states 
the bank remains dedicated to expanding wealth enhancing opportunities in the communities it serves by increasing access to capital and other financial services for consumers  businesses and non profit organizations  including faith based institutions 
a measure of its progress in achieving this goal includes the bank s outstanding rating  awarded by the office of thrift supervision following its most recent community reinvestment act cra examination in the examination report noted that of carver s community development loan originations loans that foster economic development and community revitalization and of carver s home owners mortgage disclosure act hmda reportable loan originations were within low to moderate income geographies  which far exceeded peer institutions 
the bank has approximately million in assets as of march  and employs approximately employees as of may  carver federal engages in a wide range of consumer and commercial banking services 
carver federal provides deposit products including demand  savings and time deposits for consumers  businesses  and governmental and quasi governmental agencies in its local market area within new york city 
in addition to deposit products  carver federal offers a number of other consumer and commercial banking products and services  including debit cards  online banking including online bill pay  and telephone banking 
carver federal offers loan products covering a variety of asset classes  including commercial  multi family and residential mortgages  construction loans and business loans 
the bank finances mortgage and loan products through deposits or borrowings 
funds not used to originate mortgages and loans are invested primarily in us government agency securities and mortgage backed securities 
the bank s primary market area for deposits consists of areas currently served by its nine branches 
the bank s branches are located in the brooklyn  manhattan and queens boroughs of new york city 
the neighborhoods in which the bank s branches are located have historically been low to moderate income areas 
however  the shortage of housing in new york city  combined with population shifts from the suburbs into the city  has helped stimulate significant real estate and commercial development in the bank s market area 

table of contents the bank s primary lending market includes bronx  kings  new york and queens counties in new york city  and lower westchester county  new york 
although the bank s branches are primarily located in areas that were historically underserved by other financial institutions  the bank faces significant competition for deposits and mortgage lending in its market areas 
management believes that this competition has become more intense as a result of the aforementioned market condition and increased examination emphasis by federal banking regulators on financial institutions fulfillment of their responsibilities under the cra 
carver federal s larger competitors have greater financial resources  name recognition and market presence 
the bank s competition for loans comes principally from mortgage banking companies  commercial banks  and savings institutions 
the bank s most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks  savings institutions and credit unions 
competition for deposits also comes from money market mutual funds  corporate and government securities funds  and financial intermediaries such as brokerage firms and insurance companies 
many of the bank s competitors have substantially greater resources and offer a wider array of financial services and products 
at times  these larger financial institutions may offer below market interest rates on mortgage loans and above market interest rates for deposits 
these pricing concessions combined with competitors larger presence in the new york market add to the challenges the bank faces in expanding its current market share and growing its near term profitability 
carver federal s year history in its market area  its community involvement  relationships with key constituents  targeted products and services and personal service consistent with community banking  help the bank compete with competitors that have entered its market 
the bank formalized its many community focused investments on august   by forming carver community development corporation ccdc 
ccdc oversees the bank s participation in local economic development and other community based initiatives  including financial literacy activities 
ccdc is now coordinating the bank s development of an innovative approach to reach the unbanked customer market in carver federal s communities 
importantly  ccdc spearheads the bank s applications for grants and other resources to help fund these important community activities 
in this connection  carver federal has successfully competed with large regional and global financial institutions in a number of competitions for government grants and other awards 
in june  carver federal was selected by the us department of the treasury the treasury to receive an award of million in new market tax credits nmtc 
in may  carver federal was selected to receive a second nmtc award in the amount of million 
these credits enable the bank to invest with community and development partners in economic development projects with attractive terms including  in some cases  below market interest rates  which may have the effect of attracting capital to underserved communities and facilitating revitalization of the community 
the nmtc award provides substantive credits to carver federal against federal income taxes when the bank makes qualified investments

lending activities general 
carver federal s loan portfolio consists primarily of mortgage loans originated by the bank s lending team and secured by commercial real estate  multi family and one to four family residential property and construction loans 
substantially all of the bank s mortgage loans are secured by properties located within the bank s market area 
from time to time  the bank may purchase loans from other financial institutions to achieve loan growth objectives 
loans purchased comply with the bank s underwriting standards 
in recent years  carver federal has focused on origination of commercial real estate loans and multi family residential loans 
these loans generally have higher yields and shorter maturities than one to four family residential properties  and include prepayment penalties that the bank collects if the loans pay in full prior to the contractual maturity 
the bank s increased emphasis on commercial real estate and multi family residential mortgage loans has increased the overall level of credit risk inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
the greater risk associated with commercial real estate and multi family residential loans could require the bank to increase its provisions for loan losses and to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained 
carver federal continually reviews the composition of its mortgage loan portfolio and underwriting standards to manage the risk in the portfolio 
to date  the bank has not experienced significant losses in commercial real estate  multi family residential and one to four family mortgage loan portfolios  although loan delinquencies as of march  are higher than prior comparable periods 
carver federal s construction loan portfolio consists principally of loans originated through the community preservation corporation cpc 
these loans are targeted toward affordable housing or rental dwelling units that tend to have lower risk profiles compared to other construction loans discussed below 
nevertheless  during fiscal  the bank began to deemphasize construction loans  substantially reducing originations of new construction loans  allowing the outstanding balance of the construction loan portfolio to decline 
as security for repayment  the bank obtains a first lien position on the underlying collateral  and generally obtains personal guarantees 
construction loans also generally have a term of two years or less 
construction loans involve a greater degree of risk than other loans because  among other things  the underwriting of such loans is based on an estimated value of the developed property  which can be difficult to ascertain in light of uncertainties inherent in such estimations 
in addition  construction lending entails the risk that the project may not be completed due to cost overruns or changes in market conditions 
the greater risk associated with construction loans could require the bank to increase its provision for loan losses  and to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance the bank currently maintains 
to date  carver federal has not incurred any losses in the current construction loan portfolio 
carver federal s business banking unit was formed in with the acquisition of community capital bank ccb  a commercial bank  to focus on loans to businesses located within the bank s market area 
these loans are generally personally guaranteed by the business owners  and may be secured by the assets of the business 
the interest rate on these loans is generally an adjustable rate based on a published index  usually the prime rate 
these loans  while providing the bank a higher rate of return  also present a higher level of risk 
the greater risk associated with business loans could require the bank to increase its provision for loan losses  and to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained 
to date  carver federal has incurred some losses in the business loan portfolio from loans acquired through the ccb acquisition 
loan portfolio composition 
total loans receivable increased by million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  carver federal s total loans receivable  net  as a percentage of total assets increased to at march  compared to at march  non residential real estate loans  which includes commercial real estate  totaled million  or of total loans receivable  multi family loans totaled million  or of total loans receivable  construction loans net of committed but undisbursed funds  totaled million  or of total loans receivable  one to four family mortgage loans totaled million  or of total loans receivable  business loans totaled million  or of total loans receivable  and consumer loans credit card loans  personal loans  and home improvement loans totaled million  or of total loans receivable 
for additional information regarding carver federal s loan portfolio refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements  loans receivable  net 

table of contents non residential real estate lending 
non residential real estate lending consists predominantly of originating loans for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing office  mixed use properties used for both commercial and residential purposes but predominantly commercial  retail and church buildings in the bank s market area 
mixed use loans are secured by properties which are intended for both residential and business use and are classified as commercial real estate 
non residential real estate lending entails additional risks compared with one to four family residential and multi family lending 
for example  such loans typically involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers  and the payment experience on such loans typically is dependent on the successful operation of the commercial property 
in making non residential real estate loans  the bank primarily considers the ability of the net operating income generated by the real estate to support the debt service  the financial resources  income level and managerial expertise of the borrower  the marketability of the property and the bank s lending experience with the borrower 
carver federal s maximum loan to value ltv ratio on non residential real estate mortgage loans is generally based on the appraised value of the mortgaged property 
the bank generally requires a debt service coverage ratio dscr of at least on non residential real estate loans 
the bank also requires the assignment of rents of all tenants leases in the mortgaged property and personal guarantees may be obtained for additional security from these borrowers 
at march   non residential real estate mortgage loans totaled million  or of total loans receivable 
this balance reflects a year over year increase of million  or 
the increase in originations in fiscal is the result of favorable pricing opportunities on non residential real estate loan originations during the fiscal year as a result of widening spreads compared to one to four family pricing 
however  under the current economic environment  the bank has strengthened its commercial real estate loan underwriting guidelines 
the bank offers adjustable rate mortgage arm loans with interest rate adjustment periods of one to five years and generally for terms of up to years and amortization schedules up to thirty years 
interest rates on arm loans currently offered by the bank are adjusted at the beginning of each adjustment period are generally based upon a fixed spread above the fhlb ny corresponding regular advance rate 
from time to time  the bank may originate arm loans at an initial rate lower than the index as a result of a discount on the spread for the initial adjustment period 
commercial adjustable rate mortgage loans generally are not subject to limitations on interest rate increases either on an adjustment period or aggregate basis over the life of the loan 
historically  carver federal has been a new york city metropolitan area leader in the origination of loans to churches 
at march   loans to churches totaled million  or of the bank s total loans receivable 
these loans generally have five  seven  or ten year terms with  or year amortization periods  a balloon payment due at the end of the term and generally have no greater than a ltv ratio 
the bank also provides construction financing for churches and generally provides permanent financing upon completion of construction 
there are currently church loans in the bank s loan portfolio 
loans secured by real estate owned by faith based organizations generally are larger and involve greater risks than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent on voluntary contributions by members of the church s congregation  repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy 
the bank seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways  including reviewing the organization s financial condition  limiting the size of such loans and establishing the quality of the collateral securing such loans 
the bank determines the appropriate amount and type of security for such loans based in part upon the governance structure of the particular organization  the length of time the church has been established in the community and a cash flow analysis to determine the church s ability to service the proposed loan 
carver federal will obtain a first mortgage on the underlying real property and often requires personal guarantees of key members of the congregation and or key person life insurance on the pastor 
the bank may also require the church to obtain key person life insurance on specific members of the church s leadership 
historically  asset quality in the church loan category has been strong throughout carver federal s history  however  as recent economic conditions have declined  carver has experienced some delinquencies in this portfolio 
management believes that carver federal will remain a leading lender to churches in its market area  however  carver will continue to conduct disciplined underwriting and maintain focused portfolio management 

table of contents multi family real estate lending 
traditionally  carver federal originates and purchases multi family loans  although no multi family loans were purchased in fiscal rates offered on this product are considered to be competitive with flexible terms that make this product attractive to borrowers 
multi family property lending entails additional risks compared to one to four family residential lending 
for example  such loans are dependent on the successful operation of such buildings and can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions in the market for multi family residential units 
carver federal s multi family loan portfolio increased million in fiscal  or to million  or  of carver federal s total loans receivable at march  in making multi family loans  the lending team primarily considers the property s ability to generate net operating income sufficient to support the debt service  the financial resources  income level and managerial expertise of the borrower  the marketability of the property and the bank s lending experience with the borrower 
carver federal s multi family product guidelines generally require that the maximum ltv not exceed based on the appraised value of the mortgaged property 
the bank generally requires a dscr of at least on multi family loans  which requires the properties to generate cash flow after expenses and allowances in excess of the principal and interest payment 
carver federal originates and purchases multi family loans  which are predominantly adjustable rate loans that generally amortize on the basis of a   or year period and require a balloon payment after the first five years  or the borrower may have an option to extend the loan for two additional five year periods 
the bank occasionally originates fixed rate loans with greater than five year terms 
personal guarantees may be obtained for additional security from these borrowers 
to help ensure continued collateral protection and asset quality for the term of multi family real estate loans  carver federal employs a loan risk rating system 
all commercial real estate loans are risk rated internally at the time of origination 
in addition  to evaluate changes in the credit profile of the borrower and the underlying collateral  quarterly an independent consulting firm reviews and prepares a written report for a sample of multi family real estate loan relationships of  or more  and at least annually prepares a written report for all relationships exceeding million 
summary reports are then reviewed by management for changes in the credit profile of individual borrowers and the portfolio as a whole 
construction lending 
the bank originates or participates in construction loans for new construction and renovation of multi family buildings  residential developments  community service facilities  churches  and affordable housing programs 
the bank s construction loans generally have adjustable interest rates and are underwritten in accordance with the same standards as the bank s mortgage loans on existing properties 
the loans provide for disbursement in stages as construction is completed 
participation in construction loans may be at various stages of funding 
construction terms are usually from to months 
the construction loan interest is capitalized as part of the overall project cost and is funded monthly from the loan proceeds 
borrowers must satisfy all credit requirements that apply to the bank s permanent mortgage loan financing for the mortgaged property 
carver federal has additional criteria for construction loans to include an engineer s plan and cost review on all construction budgets with interest reserves for loans in excess of  construction financing generally is considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long term financing on improved and occupied real estate 
risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the mortgaged property s value at completion of construction or development and the estimated cost including interest of construction 
during the construction phase  a number of factors could result in project delays and cost overruns 
if the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate  the bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the development 
if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate  the bank may be confronted  at or prior to the maturity of the loan  with a project having a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of such loan 
the ability of a developer to sell completed dwelling units will depend on  among other things  demand  pricing  availability of comparable properties and economic conditions 
the bank has sought to minimize this risk by limiting construction lending to qualified borrowers in the bank s market areas  limiting the aggregate amount of outstanding construction loans and imposing a stricter ltv ratio requirement than that required for one to four family mortgage loans 

table of contents at march   the bank had million net of million of committed but undisbursed funds in construction loans outstanding  comprising of the bank s gross loan portfolio 
the balance at march  reflects a million  or  decrease over fiscal  consistent with the bank s objective of deemphasizing construction loans and letting the remaining principal balances amortize down 
purchased construction loans represent of total construction loans in portfolio 
the bank s primary source of construction loan purchases is with the community preservation corporation cpc  a non profit corporation sponsored by more than commercial banks  savings institutions and insurance companies that provides mortgage  construction and other lending for affordable housing  with a complementary goal to revitalize low and moderate income communities 
due to the recent downturn in real estate conditions and the economy in general  it has become increasingly difficult for developers of these construction projects to provide end loan financing for purchasers of their units 
this is due to more stringent pre sale and other financing guidelines established by the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the traditional buyers of these end loans 
the bank is actively working with the developers to commence a program to provide end loan financing to qualified prospective buyers of these units 
if the developers are unable to obtain end loan financing for the sellout of the projects  such developments may be converted to rental units 
the bank has also underwritten such construction projects as residential rental building in the event the units cannot be sold  which would allow a takeout of the loans by various governmental agencies 
in this connection  at march   carver federal had cpc originated loans aggregating million that have been originated for the development of for sale dwelling units with the option of the developer to convert the properties to rental units and close on committed financing from the new york city pension fund nyc pension fund  which financing will be used to satisfy carver federal s loan 
carver federal has personal guarantees to cover any short fall between nyc pension fund loan commitment amounts and the amount due carver federal 
at march   carver federal also had seventeen cpc loans aggregating million that were originated as rental properties with the expectation that these loans would be satisfied by existing loan commitments issued by the nyc pension fund 
one to four family residential lending 
historically  carver federal emphasized the origination and purchase of first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties that serve as the primary residence of the owner 
to a much lesser degree  the bank has made loans to investors that are secured by non owner occupied one to four family properties  although this practice has been discontinued 
in the past the bank has also purchased one to four family loans  however  no such loans were purchased in fiscal recently  the bank has entered into an arrangement with a third party to originate and underwrite one to four family loans for the bank using the bank s underwriting standards 
carver federal offers both fixed rate and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans with maturities of up to years and a general maximum loan amount of million 
approximately of the one to four family residential mortgage loans maturing in greater than one year at march  were adjustable rate and approximately were fixed rate 
one to four family residential real estate loans decreased million to million  or  of the gross loan portfolio at march  compared to march  of this amount  million are subprime loans  or of total loans receivable 
million are non performing loans 
the bank decreased it emphasis on one to four family lending due to more favorable pricing on multi family residential and commercial real estate lending 
the bank s lending policies generally limit the maximum loan to value ltv ratio on one to four family residential mortgage loans secured by owner occupied properties to of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price  with private mortgage insurance required on loans with ltv ratios in excess of 
under certain special loan programs  carver federal may originate and sell loans secured by single family homes purchased by first time home buyers where the ltv ratio may be up to 
carver federal s fixed rate  one to four family residential mortgage loans are underwritten in accordance with applicable secondary market underwriting guidelines and requirements for sale 
from time to time the bank has sold such loans to the federal national mortgage association fnma  the state of new york mortgage agency sonyma and other third parties 
loans are generally sold with limited recourse on a servicing retained basis except to sonyma where the sale is made with servicing released 
carver federal uses several servicing firms to sub service mortgage loans  whether held in portfolio or sold with the servicing retained 
at march   the bank  through its sub servicers  serviced million in loans for fnma and million for other third parties 

table of contents carver federal offers one year  three year  five one year and five three year adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans 
these loans are generally retained in carver federal s portfolio although they may be sold in the secondary market 
they are indexed to the weekly average rate on one year  three year and five year us treasury or federal home loan bank fhlb securities  respectively  adjusted to a constant maturity usually one year  plus a margin 
the rates at which interest accrues on these loans are adjustable every one  three or five years  generally with limitations on adjustments of two percentage points per adjustment period and six percentage points over the life of a one year adjustable rate mortgage and four percentage points over the life of three year and five year adjustable rate mortgages 
the retention of adjustable rate loans in carver federal s portfolio helps reduce carver federal s exposure to increases in prevailing market interest rates 
however  there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increases in costs to borrowers in the event of upward re pricing of adjustable rate loans 
it is possible that during periods of rising interest rates  the risk of default on adjustable rate loans may increase due to increases in interest costs to borrowers 
although adjustable rate loans allow the bank to increase the sensitivity of its interest earning assets to changes in interest rates  the extent of this interest rate sensitivity is limited by periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that yields on the bank s adjustable rate loans will fully adjust to compensate for increases in the bank s cost of funds 
adjustable rate loans increase the bank s exposure to decreases in prevailing market interest rates  although decreases in the bank s cost of funds would tend to offset this effect 
business loans 
carver federal s small business lending portfolio increased by million to million  or  of the bank s gross loan portfolio 
carver federal provides revolving credit and term loan facilities to small businesses with annual sales of approximately million to million in manufacturing  services and wholesale segments 
business loans are personally guaranteed by the owners  and may also be secured by additional collateral  including real estate  equipment and inventory 
included in commercial business loans are loans made to owners of new york city taxi medallions 
these loans  which totaled million at march   are secured through first liens on the taxi medallions 
carver federal originates taxi medallion loans up to of the value of the taxi medallion 
consumer and other loans 
at march   the bank had million in consumer and other loans  or  of the bank s gross loan portfolio 
at march   million  or  of the bank s consumer loans were unsecured loans  consisting of consumer loans other than loans secured by savings deposits  and million  or  were secured by savings deposits 
consumer loans generally involve more risk than first mortgage loans 
collection of a delinquent loan is dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus is more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
further  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount which can be recovered 
these loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a borrower against carver federal  and a borrower may be able to assert claims and defenses against carver federal which it has against the seller of the underlying collateral 
in underwriting unsecured consumer loans other than secured credit cards  carver federal considers the borrower s credit history  an analysis of the borrower s income  expenses and ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral 
the underwriting for secured credit cards only takes into consideration the value of the underlying collateral 
see asset quality non performing assets 
loan processing 
carver federal s loan originations are derived from a number of sources  including referrals by realtors  builders  depositors  borrowers and mortgage brokers  as well as walk in customers 
loans are originated by the bank s personnel who receive a base salary  commissions and other incentive compensation 
real estate  business and unsecured loan applications are forwarded to the bank s lending department for underwriting pursuant to standards established in carver federal s loan policy 
the underwriting and loan processing for residential one to four family loans are performed by an outsourced third party loan originator using lending standards established by the bank 

table of contents a commercial real estate loan application is completed for all multi family and non residential properties which the bank finances 
prior to loan approval  the property is inspected by a loan officer 
as part of the loan approval process  consideration is given to an independent appraisal  location  accessibility  stability of the neighborhood  environmental assessment  personal credit history of the applicant s and the financial capacity of the applicant s 
business loan applications are completed for all business loans 
most business loans are secured by real estate  personal guarantees  and or guarantees by the united states small business association sba or uniform commercial code ucc filings 
the loan approval process considers the credit history of the applicant  collateral  cash flow and purpose and stability of the business 
upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower  a credit report and other verifications are ordered to confirm specific information relating to the loan applicant s income and credit standing 
it is the bank s policy to obtain an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure a proposed mortgage loan from an independent appraiser approved by the bank 
it is carver federal s policy to record a lien on the real estate securing the loan and to obtain a title insurance policy that insures that the property is free of prior encumbrances 
borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance policies prior to closing and  when the property is in a flood plain as designated by the department of housing and urban development  paid flood insurance policies must be obtained 
most borrowers are also required to advance funds on a monthly basis  together with each payment of principal and interest  to a mortgage escrow account from which the bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes and hazard insurance

see regulation and supervision federal banking regulation loans to one borrower limitations 
at march   the maximum loans to one borrower under this test would be million and the bank had no relationships that exceeded this limit 
loan sales 
originations of one to four family real estate loans are generally made on properties located within the new york city metropolitan area  although carver federal occasionally funds loans secured by property in other areas 
all such loans  however  satisfy the bank s underwriting criteria regardless of location 
the bank continues to offer one to four family fixed rate mortgage loans in response to consumer demand but requires that such loans satisfy applicable secondary market guidelines of fnma  sonyma or other third party purchaser to provide the opportunity for subsequent sale in the secondary market as desired to manage interest rate risk exposure 
loan originations and purchases 
loan originations  including loans originated for sale  were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in prior years  the bank increased its loan production of non residential commercial real estate and multi family lending  including those in construction  to take advantage of higher yields and better interest rate risk characteristics 
however  due to the recent downturn in the real estate market and the economy in general  the bank has strengthened its underwriting guidelines related to originations of non residential commercial real estate loans and has curtailed construction lending given the additional risks associated with this product 
in addition  the bank has become more selective in purchasing loans 
as a result  there were no purchases of loans during fiscal compared to million for fiscal 
table of contents the following table sets forth certain information with respect to carver federal s loan originations  purchases and sales for the fiscal years ended march in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent loans originated one to four family multi family non residential construction business consumer and others total loans originated loans purchased total loans originated and purchased loans sold net additions to loan portfolio comprised of personal and credit card loans 
comprised of primarily construction and non residential mortgage loans and business loans 
comprised of primarily one to four family mortgage loans 
loans purchased by the bank entail certain risks not necessarily associated with loans the bank originates 
the bank s purchased loans are generally acquired without recourse  with certain exceptions related to the seller s compliance with representations and warranties  and in accordance with the bank s underwriting criteria for originations 
in addition  purchased loans have a variety of terms  including maturities  interest rate caps and indices for adjustment of interest rates  that may differ from those offered at that time by the bank 
the bank initially seeks to purchase loans in its market area  however  the bank may purchase loans secured by property secured outside its market area to meet its financial objectives 
the market areas in which the properties that secure the purchased loans are located may differ from carver federal s market area and may be subject to economic and real estate market conditions that may significantly differ from those experienced in carver federal s market area 
there can be no assurance that economic conditions in these out of state markets will not deteriorate in the future  resulting in increased loan delinquencies and loan losses among the loans secured by property in these areas 
in an effort to reduce risks  the bank has sought to ensure that purchased loans satisfy the bank s underwriting standards and do not otherwise have a higher risk of collection or loss than loans originated by the bank 
a review of each purchased loan is conducted  and the bank also requires appropriate documentation and further seeks to reduce its risk by requiring  in each buy sell agreement  a series of warranties and representations as to the underwriting standards and the enforceability of the related legal documents 
these warranties and representations remain in effect for the life of the loan 
any misrepresentation must be cured within days of discovery or trigger certain repurchase provisions in the buy sell agreement

the following table sets forth information at march  regarding the amount of loans maturing in carver federal s portfolio  including scheduled repayments of principal  based on contractual terms to maturity

scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual lives of such assets 
the average life of long term loans is substantially less than their contractual terms due to prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses in mortgage loans generally give carver federal the right to declare a conventional loan due and payable in the event  among other things  that a borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan market rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and tends to decrease when current mortgage loan market rates are lower than rates on existing mortgage loans in thousands due after march  fixed adjustable total gross loans receivable one to four family multi family non residential construction business consumer total asset quality general 
one of the bank s key operating objectives continues to be to maintain a high level of asset quality 
through a variety of strategies  including  but not limited to  monitoring loan delinquencies and borrower workout arrangements  the bank has been proactive in addressing problem loans and non performing assets 
the maintenance of sound credit standards for loan originations has resulted in the bank historically having lower net charge offs of loans 
the underlying credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrower s ability to continue to make required loan payments and  in the event a borrower is unable to continue to do so  the adequacy of the value of the collateral securing the loan 
for non residential real estate and multi family loans  the borrower s ability to pay typically is dependent on rental income which can be impacted by vacancies and general market conditions 
for one to four family loans  a borrower s ability to pay typically is dependent primarily on employment and other sources of income 
a borrower s ability to pay is also impacted by general economic and other factors  such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in the financial markets 
collateral values  particularly real estate values  are also impacted by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  demographics  maintenance and collection or foreclosure delays 

table of contents non performing assets 
non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  accruing loans days or more past due and property acquired in settlement of loans 
when a borrower fails to make a payment on a loan  immediate steps are taken by carver federal and its loan servicers to have the delinquency cured and the loan restored to current status 
this includes a series of actions including phone calls  letters and  if necessary  legal action or other appropriate action 
in the case of business loans the collection process is similar 
the bank may pursue foreclosure or other appropriate action for business loans secured by real estate 
for business loans not secured by real estate  the bank may seek the small business administration sba guarantee or other appropriate action  where applicable 
loans that remain delinquent are reviewed for charge off 
the bank s collection efforts continue after the loan is charged off  except when a determination is made that collection efforts have been exhausted or are not productive 
the bank may from time to time agree to modify the contractual terms of a borrower s loan 
in cases where such modifications represent a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty  the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring 
loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring are placed on non accrual status until the bank determines that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured  which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms of six months 
at march   loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring  which are included in non accrual loans  totaled million 
the following table sets forth information with respect to carver federal s non performing assets which includes non accrual loans  accruing loans days or more past due and property acquired in settlement of loans 
as of march dollars in thousands loans accounted for on a non accrual basis gross loans receivable one to four family multi family non residential construction business consumer total non accrual loans accruing loans contractually past due days total non accrual accruing loans past due days other non performing assets real estate owned total other non performing assets total non performing assets non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets non accrual status denotes any loan where the delinquency exceeds days past due and loans  in the opinion of management  the collection of additional interest is doubtful 
payments received on a non accrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of the ability to collect on the loan 
other non performing assets generally represent property acquired by the bank in settlement of loans ie  through foreclosure  repossession or as an in substance foreclosure 
these assets are recorded at the lower of their fair value or the cost to acquire 
at march   total non performing assets increased by million to million  compared to million at march  non accrual loans consist of one to four family loans  multi family loans  non residential real estate loans  construction loan and small business and sba loans 
the increase in delinquent loans from the prior year appears to be primarily the result of deterioration in economic conditions which have already impacted some borrowers 
management believes that the risk of losses on certain delinquent loans is mitigated by the values of the properties securing these delinquent loans and existing loan loss reserves 
other real estate owned of million reflects three properties foreclosed upon 

table of contents asset classification and allowances for losses 
federal regulations and the bank s policies require the classification of assets on the basis of credit quality on a quarterly basis 
an asset is classified as substandard if it is non performing and or determined to be inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the current value of the collateral pledged  if any 
an asset is classified as doubtful if full collection is highly questionable or improbable 
an asset is classified as loss if it is considered un collectible  even if a partial recovery could be expected in the future 
the regulations also provide for a special mention designation  described as assets that do not currently expose a savings institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management s close attention 
assets classified as substandard or doubtful result in a higher level of allowances for loan losses recorded under sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as a loss  a savings institution must either establish specific allowances for loan losses pursuant to sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan in the amount of the portion of the asset classified loss or charge off such amount 
federal examiners may disagree with a savings institution s classifications 
if a savings institution does not agree with an examiner s classification of an asset  it may appeal this determination to the ots regional director 
the ots  in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan losses and lease losses 
the policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines 
generally  the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  that management analyze all significant factors that affect the ability to collect the portfolio in a reasonable manner and that management establish acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement 
management is responsible for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis  but may increase in frequency should conditions arise that would require management s prompt attention  such as business combinations and opportunities to dispose of non performing and marginally performing loans by bulk sale or any development which may indicate an adverse trend 
although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of specific and general loan loss allowances may become necessary 
federal examiners may disagree with a savings institution as to the appropriate level of the institution s allowance for loan losses 
while management believes carver federal has established its existing loss allowances in accordance with the alll  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing carver federal s assets  will not require carver federal to increase its loss allowance  thereby negatively affecting carver federal s reported financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information regarding carver federal s alll policy  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
the board has designated the internal asset review committee on a quarterly basis to perform a review of the bank s asset quality  establish general and specific allowances  determine loan classifications and submit their report to the board for review 
carver federal s methodology for establishing the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration probable losses that have been identified in connection with specific loans as well as losses that have not been identified but can be expected to occur 
further  management reviews the ratio of allowances to total loans including projected growth and recommends adjustments to the level of allowances accordingly 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowances for losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the initial determinations  or if circumstances pertaining to individual loans change  or new information pertaining to individual loans or the loan portfolio is identified 
the bank has a centralized loan servicing structure that relies upon outside servicers  each of which generates a monthly report of delinquent loans 
the asset liability and interest rate risk committee of the board establishes policy relating to internal classification of loans and also provides input to the internal asset review committee in its review of classified assets 
in originating loans  carver federal recognizes that credit losses will occur and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the security for the loan 

table of contents it is management s policy to maintain a general allowance for loan losses based on  among other things  regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality  character and size  the bank s and the industry s historical and projected loss experience and current and forecasted economic conditions 
in addition  considerable uncertainty exists as to the future improvement or deterioration of the real estate markets in various states  or of their ultimate impact on carver federal as a result of its purchased loans in such states 
see lending activities loan purchases and originations 
carver federal increases its allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for possible losses against the bank s income 
general allowances are established by management on at least a quarterly basis based on an assessment of risk in the bank s loans  taking into consideration the composition and quality of the portfolio  delinquency trends  current charge off and loss experience  the state of the real estate market and economic conditions generally 
specific allowances are provided for individual loans  or portions of loans  when ultimate collection is considered improbable by management based on the current payment status of the loan and the fair value or net realizable value of the security for the loan 
a loan is generally deemed impaired when it is probable the bank will be unable to collect both principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
loans the bank individually classifies as impaired include multi family mortgage loans  commercial real estate loans  construction loans  business loans and one to four family mortgage loans  which have been classified by the bank s credit review officer as substandard  doubtful or loss  and certain loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring a valuation allowance is established when the current estimated fair value of the property that collateralizes the impaired loan  if any  is less than the recorded investment in the loan 
at the date of foreclosure or other repossession or at the date the bank determines a property is an impaired property  the bank transfers the property to real estate acquired in settlement of loans at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated selling costs 
fair value is defined as the amount in cash or cash equivalent value of other consideration that a real estate parcel would yield in a current sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller 
any amount of cost in excess of fair value is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
carver federal records an allowance for estimated selling costs of the property immediately after foreclosure 
subsequent to acquisition  management periodically evaluates the property and an allowance is established if the estimated fair value of the property  less estimated costs to sell  declines 
if  upon ultimate disposition of the property  net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the property  a gain on sale of real estate is recorded  providing the bank did not provide the loan

table of contents investment activities general 
the bank utilizes mortgage backed and other investment securities in its asset liability management strategy 
in making investment decisions  the bank considers  among other things  its yield and interest rate objectives  its interest rate and credit risk position and its liquidity and cash flow 
generally  the investment policy of the bank is to invest funds among categories of investments and maturities based upon the bank s asset liability management policies  investment quality  loan and deposit volume and collateral requirements  liquidity needs and performance objectives 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  requires that securities be classified into three categories trading  held to maturity  and available for sale 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt securities for which the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
all other securities not classified as trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included  on an after tax basis  in a separate component of stockholders equity 
at march   the bank had no securities classified as trading 
at march   million  or of the bank s mortgage backed and other investment securities  was classified as available for sale 
the remaining million  or  was classified as held to maturity 
mortgage backed securities 
the bank has invested in mortgage backed securities to help achieve its asset liability management goals and collateral needs 
although mortgage backed securities generally yield less than whole loans  they present substantially lower credit risk  are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize obligations of the bank 
because carver federal receives regular payments of principal and interest from its mortgage backed securities  these investments provide more consistent cash flows than investments in other debt securities  which generally only pay principal at maturity 
mortgage backed securities also help the bank meet certain definitional tests for favorable treatment under federal banking and tax laws 
see regulation and supervision federal banking regulation qualified thrift lender test and federal and state taxation 
at march   mortgage backed securities constituted of total assets  as compared to of total assets at march  carver federal maintains a portfolio of mortgage backed securities in the form of government national mortgage association gnma pass through certificates  federal national mortgage association fnma and federal home loan mortgage corp fhlmc participation certificates 
gnma pass through certificates are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the united states government while fnma and fhlmc certificates are each guaranteed by their respective agencies as to principal and interest 
mortgage backed securities generally entitle carver federal to receive a pro rata portion of the cash flows from an identified pool of mortgages 
the cash flows from such pools are segmented and paid in accordance with a predetermined priority to various classes of securities issued by the entity 
carver federal has also invested in pools of loans guaranteed as to principal and interest by the small business administration sba 
the bank seeks to manage interest rate risk by investing in adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  which at march   constituted million  or  of the mortgage backed securities portfolio 
mortgage backed securities  however  expose carver federal to certain unique risks 
in a declining rate environment  accelerated prepayments of loans underlying these securities expose carver federal to the risk that it will be unable to obtain comparable yields upon reinvestment of the proceeds 
in the event the mortgage backed security has been funded with an interest bearing liability with maturity comparable to the original estimated life of the mortgage backed security  the bank s interest rate spread could be adversely affected 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  the bank may experience a lower than estimated rate of repayment on the underlying mortgages  effectively extending the estimated life of the mortgage backed security and exposing the bank to the risk that it may be required to fund the asset with a liability bearing a higher rate of interest 
for additional information regarding carver federal s mortgage backed securities portfolio and its maturities refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements  securities 

table of contents other investment securities 
in addition to mortgage backed securities  the bank also invests in high quality assets primarily government and agency obligations with short and intermediate terms typically seven years or less to maturity 
carver federal is permitted under federal law to make certain investments  including investments in securities issued by various federal agencies and state and municipal governments  deposits at the fhlb ny  certificates of deposit in federally insured institutions  certain bankers acceptances and federal funds 
the bank may also invest  subject to certain limitations  in commercial paper having one of the two highest investment ratings of a nationally recognized credit rating agency  and certain other types of corporate debt securities and mutual funds see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other earning assets 
federal regulations require the bank to maintain an investment in fhlb ny stock and a sufficient amount of liquid assets which may be invested in cash and specified securities 
for additional information  see regulation and supervision federal banking regulation liquidity 
securities impairment 
the bank s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
securities that the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the fair values of securities in portfolio are based on published or securities dealers market values and are affected by changes in interest rates 
the bank quarterly reviews and evaluates the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other than temporary 
the bank generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary  which is consistent with its experience 
however  if such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary  the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged to earnings 
at march   the bank held a private label mortgage backed security which was determined to be other than temporarily impaired in the amount of thousand 
sources of funds general 
deposits are the primary source of carver federal s funds for lending and other investment purposes 
in addition to deposits  carver federal derives funds from loan principal repayments  loan and investment interest payments  maturing investments and fee income 
loan and mortgage backed securities repayments and interest payments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by prevailing market interest rates  pricing of deposits  competition and general economic conditions 
borrowed money may be used to supplement the bank s available funds  and from time to time the bank borrows funds from the fhlb ny and has borrowed funds through repurchase agreements and trust preferred debt securities 
deposits 
carver federal attracts deposits from consumers  businesses  non profit organizations and public entities through its nine branches principally from within its market area by offering a variety of deposit instruments  including passbook and statement accounts and certificates of deposit  which range in term from days to five years 
deposit terms vary  principally on the basis of the minimum balance required  the length of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate 
carver federal also offers individual retirement accounts 
carver federal also holds deposits from various governmental agencies or authorities and corporations 
the bank s malcom x  bradhurst  jamaica and sunset park branches operate in new york state designated banking development districts bdd  which allows carver federal to obtain new york city and new york state deposits 
as of march   carver federal held million in bdd deposits 
bdd deposits are designed to encourage the development of branches and provision of banking products and services in underserved communities 
at march  the bank held million in brokered certificates of deposits which the bank intends to replace with non brokered deposits as they mature 

table of contents the bank also has million of reciprocal deposits acquired through its participation in the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars 
as a participant  the cdars network arranges for placement of carver federal s customer funds into certificate of deposit accounts issued by other cdars member banks in increments of less than the individual fdic insurance limit amount to ensure that both principal and interest are eligible for full fdic deposit insurance 
this allows the bank to maintain its customer relationship while still providing its customers with fdic insurance for the full amount of their deposits  up to million per customer 
in exchange  carver federal receives from other member banks their customer s deposits in like amounts 
depositors are allowed to withdraw funds  with a penalty  from these accounts 
carver federal may  but has not at this time elected to  make or receive non reciprocal deposits 
prior to the emergency economic stabilization act of essa the fdic deposit insurance limit was  as result of essa  this limit has been increased to  through december  deposit interest rates  maturities  service fees and withdrawal penalties on deposits are established based on the bank s funds acquisition and liquidity requirements  the rates paid by the bank s competitors  current market rates  the bank s growth goals and applicable regulatory restrictions and requirements

borrowed money 
while deposits are the primary source of funds for carver federal s lending  investment and general operating activities  carver federal is authorized to obtain advances from the fhlb ny and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repos from approved primary dealers to supplement its supply of funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
the fhlb ny functions as a central bank providing credit for savings institutions and certain other member financial institutions 
as a member of the fhlb  carver federal is required to own stock in the fhlb ny and is authorized to apply for advances 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs  each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
advances from the fhlb ny are secured by carver federal s stock in the fhlb ny and a pledge a portion of carver federal s mortgage loan and mortgage backed securities portfolios 
the bank takes into consideration the term of borrowed money with the re pricing cycle of the mortgage loans on its balance sheet 
at march   carver had million in fhlb ny advances and repos 
on september   carver statutory trust i issued  shares  liquidation amount  per share  of floating rate capital securities 
gross proceeds from the sale of these trust preferred debt securities were million and  together with the proceeds from the sale of the trust s common securities  were used to purchase approximately million aggregate principal amount of the holding company s floating rate junior subordinated debt securities due the trust preferred debt securities are redeemable quarterly at the option of the company beginning on or after september  and have a mandatory redemption date of september  cash distributions on the trust preferred debt securities are cumulative and payable at a floating rate per annum reset quarterly equal to over month libor  with a rate at march  of

regulation and supervision general the bank is subject to extensive regulation  examination and supervision by its primary regulator  the ots 
the bank s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic under the deposit insurance fund dif  and is a member of the fhlb 
the bank must file reports with the ots concerning its activities and financial condition  and it must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions  such as mergers with  or acquisitions of  other depository institutions 
the holding company  as a unitary savings and loan holding company  is subject to regulation  examination and supervision by the ots and is required to file certain reports with  and otherwise comply with  the rules and regulations of the ots and of the sec under the federal securities laws 
the ots and the fdic periodically perform safety and soundness examinations of the bank and the holding company and test compliance with various regulatory requirements 
the ots has primary enforcement responsibility over federally chartered savings banks and has substantial discretion to impose enforcement action on an institution that fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  particularly with respect to its capital requirements 
in addition  the fdic has the authority to recommend to the director of the ots that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federally chartered savings bank and  if action is not taken by the director  the fdic has authority to take such action under certain circumstances 

table of contents this regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework to regulate and control the activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors 
this structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
any change in such laws and regulations whether by the ots  the fdic or through legislation could have a material adverse impact on the bank and the holding company and their operations and stockholders 
the description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to federally chartered savings banks and their holding companies and of tax matters set forth in this document does not purport to be a complete description of all such statutes and regulations and their effects on the bank and the holding company 
recent government actions the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  was signed into law on october  and authorizes the treasury to establish the troubled asset relief program tarp to purchase certain troubled assets from financial institutions  including banks and thrifts 
under the tarp  the treasury may purchase residential and commercial mortgages  and securities  obligations or other instruments based on such mortgages  originated or issued on or before march  that the secretary of the treasury determines promotes market stability  as well as any other financial instrument that the treasury  after consultation with the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  or frb  determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote market stability 
in the case of a publicly traded financial institution that sells troubled assets into the tarp  the treasury must receive a warrant giving the treasury the right to receive nonvoting common stock or preferred stock in such financial institution  or voting stock with respect to which the treasury agrees not to exercise voting power  subject to certain de minimis exceptions 
in addition  all financial institutions that sell troubled assets to the tarp and meet certain conditions will also be subject to certain executive compensation restrictions  which differ depending on how the troubled assets are acquired under the tarp 
on october   the treasury announced that it will purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts 
under this program  known as the troubled asset relief program capital purchase program the tarp cpp  the treasury made billion of capital available from the billion authorized by the eesa to us financial institutions in the form of preferred stock 
in conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock  the treasury will receive warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the preferred investment 
participating financial institutions will be required to adopt the treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity issued under the tarp cpp 
on january   the company announced that it completed the sale of million in preferred stock to the treasury in connection with carver s participation in the tarp cpp 
importantly  carver is exempt from the requirement to issue a warrant to the treasury to purchase shares of common stock  as the bank is a certified cdfi  conducting most of its depository and lending activities in disadvantaged communities 
therefore  the investment did not dilute common stock stockholders 
as a participant in tarp cpp  the company is subject to certain obligations currently in effect  such as compensation restrictions  a luxury expenditure policy  the requirement the company include a say on pay proposal in the proxy statement and certain certifications 
the company is also subject to additional restrictions or obligations as may be imposed under tarp cpp for as long as the company participates in tarp cpp 
in addition to establishing the tarp  the eesa also requires that the secretary of the treasury establish a program that will guarantee the principal of  and interest on  troubled assets originated or issued prior to march  to help restore liquidity and stability to the financial system known as the temporary liquidity guaranty program tlgp 
the secretary of the treasury will establish premiums for financial institutions that participate in this program and may provide for variations in such rates in accordance with the credit risk associated with the particular troubled asset being guaranteed 

table of contents federal banking regulation activity powers 
the bank derives its lending and investment powers from the home owners loan act hola  as amended  and the regulations of the ots 
under these laws and regulations  the bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate  commercial and consumer loans  certain types of debt securities and certain other assets 
the bank may also establish service corporations that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for the bank  including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage 
the bank s authority to invest in certain types of loans or other investments is limited by federal law 
these investment powers are subject to various limitations  including a prohibition against the acquisition of any corporate debt security that is not rated in one of the four highest rating categories  a limit of of an association s capital on the aggregate amount of loans secured by non residential real estate property  a limit of of an association s assets on commercial loans  with the amount of commercial loans in excess of of assets being limited to small business loans  a limit of of an association s assets on the aggregate amount of consumer loans and acquisitions of certain debt securities  a limit of of assets on non conforming loans loans in excess of the specific limitations of hola  and a limit of the greater of of assets or an association s capital on certain construction loans made for the purpose of financing what is or is expected to become residential property 
on october   the ots and other federal bank regulatory authorities published the interagency guidance on nontraditional mortgage product risks  or the guidance 
the guidance describes sound practices for managing risk  as well as marketing  originating and servicing nontraditional mortgage products  which include  among other things  interest only loans 
the guidance sets forth supervisory expectations with respect to loan terms and underwriting standards  portfolio and risk management practices and consumer protection 
for example  the guidance indicates that originating interest only loans with reduced documentation is considered a layering of risk and that institutions are expected to demonstrate mitigating factors to support their underwriting decision and the borrower s repayment capacity 
specifically  the guidance indicates that a lender should be able to readily document income and a lender may accept a borrower s statement as to the borrower s income without obtaining verification only if there are mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for direct verification of repayment capacity 
on december   the ots published guidance entitled concentrations in commercial real estate lending  sound risk management practices  or the cre guidance  to address concentrations of commercial real estate loans in savings associations 
the cre guidance reinforces and enhances the ots existing regulations and guidelines for real estate lending and loan portfolio management  but does not establish specific commercial real estate lending limits 
the bank has evaluated the cre guidance to determine its compliance and  as necessary  modified its risk management practices  underwriting guidelines and consumer protection standards 
see lending activities and asset quality in item  business for discussions of carver federal s loan product offerings and related underwriting standards 
on june   the ots and other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final statement on subprime mortgage lending  or the statement  to address the growing concerns facing the subprime mortgage market  particularly with respect to rapidly rising subprime default rates that may indicate borrowers do not have the ability to repay adjustable rate subprime loans originated by financial institutions 
in particular  the agencies expressed concern in the statement that current underwriting practices do not take into account that many subprime borrowers are not prepared for payment shock and that the current subprime lending practices compound risk for financial institutions 
the statement describes the prudent safety and soundness and consumer protection standards that financial institutions should follow to ensure borrowers obtain loans that they can afford to repay 
these standards include a fully indexed  fully amortized qualification for borrowers and cautions on risk layering features  including an expectation that stated income and reduced documentation should be accepted only if there are documented mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for verification of a borrower s repayment capacity 
consumer protection standards include clear and balanced product disclosures to customers and limits on prepayment penalties that allow for a reasonable period of time  typically at least days  for borrowers to refinance prior to the expiration of the initial fixed interest rate period without penalty 
the statement also reinforces the april  interagency statement on working with mortgage borrowers  in which the federal bank regulatory agencies encouraged institutions to work constructively with residential borrowers who are financially unable or reasonably expected to be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations on their home loans 
in addition  the statement referenced expanded guidance issued by the agencies by press release dated january  according to the expanded guidance  subprime loans are loans to borrowers which display one or more characteristics of reduced payment capacity 
five specific criteria  which are not intended to be exhaustive and are not meant to define specific parameters for all subprime borrowers and may not match all markets or institutions specific subprime definitions  are set forth  including having a fico credit score of or below at the time of origination 
within the bank s loan portfolio  there are loans to borrowers who had fico scores of or below at the time of origination 
however  as a portfolio lender  the bank reviews all data contained in borrower credit reports and does not base underwriting decisions solely on fico scores 
the bank believes the aforementioned loans  when made  were amply collateralized and otherwise conformed to the bank s prime lending standards 
these loans are not a material component of the one to four family mortgage loan portfolio

loans to one borrower limitations 
the bank is generally subject to the same limits on loans to one borrower as a national bank 
with specified exceptions  the bank s total loans or extension of credit to a single borrower or group of related borrowers may not exceed of the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus  which does not include accumulated other comprehensive income 
the bank may lend additional amounts up to of its unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus if the loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily marketable collateral 
the bank currently complies with applicable loans to one borrower limitations 
at march   the bank s limit on loans to one borrower based on its unimpaired capital and surplus was million 
qualified thrift lender test 
under hola  the bank must comply with a qualified thrift lender qtl test 
under this test  the bank is required to maintain at least of its portfolio assets in certain qualified thrift investments on a monthly basis in at least nine months of the most recent twelve month period 
portfolio assets means  in general  an association s total assets less the sum of a specified liquid assets up to of total assets  b goodwill and other intangible assets and c the value of property used to conduct the bank s business 
qualified thrift investments include various types of loans made for residential and housing purposes  investments related to such purposes  including certain mortgage backed and related securities and consumer loans 
if the bank fails the qtl test  it must either operate under certain restrictions on its activities or convert from a thrift charter to a bank charter 
in addition  if the bank does not re qualify under the qtl test within three years after failing the test  the bank would be prohibited from engaging in any activity not permissible for a national bank and would have to repay any outstanding advances from the fhlb ny as promptly as possible 
at march   the bank maintained approximately of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments 
the bank had also met the qtl test in each of the prior months and was  therefore  a qualified thrift lender 
capital requirements 
the ots capital regulations require federally chartered savings associations to meet three minimum capital ratios a tangible capital ratio  a leverage core capital ratio and an total risk based capital ratio 
in assessing an institution s capital adequacy  the ots takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well  and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary 
carver federal  as a matter of prudent management  targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed these minimum requirements and that are consistent with carver federal s risk profile 
at march   carver federal exceeded each of its capital requirements with a tangible capital ratio of  leverage capital ratio of and total risk based capital ratio of 
table of contents the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  or fdicia  requires that the ots and other federal banking agencies revise their risk based capital standards  with appropriate transition rules  to ensure that they take into account irr concentration of risk and the risks of non traditional activities 
the ots regulations do not include a specific irr component of the risk based capital requirement 
however  the ots monitors the irr of individual institutions through a variety of means  including an analysis of the change in net portfolio value  or npv 
npv is defined as the net present value of the expected future cash flows of an entity s assets and liabilities and  therefore  hypothetically represents the value of an institution s net worth 
the ots has also used this npv analysis as part of its evaluation of certain applications or notices submitted by thrift institutions 
in addition  ots thrift bulletin a provides guidance on the management of irr and the responsibility of boards of directors in that area 
the ots  through its general oversight of the safety and soundness of savings associations  retains the right to impose minimum capital requirements on individual institutions to the extent the institution is not in compliance with certain written guidelines established by the ots regarding npv analysis 
the ots has not imposed any such requirements on carver federal 
prompt corrective action regulations 
under the prompt corrective action regulations  the ots is authorized and  in some cases  required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks 
for this purpose  a savings bank would be placed in one of the following five categories based on the bank s regulatory capital well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized 
the severity of the action authorized or required to be taken under the prompt corrective action regulations increases as a bank s capital decreases within the three undercapitalized categories 
all banks are prohibited from paying dividends or other capital distributions or paying management fees to any controlling person if  following such distribution  the bank would be undercapitalized 
generally  a capital restoration plan must be filed with the ots within days of the date a bank receives notice that it is undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
in addition  various mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to the institution  including restrictions on growth of assets and other forms of expansion 
under the ots regulations  generally  a federally chartered savings bank is treated as well capitalized if its total risk based capital ratio is or greater  its tier risk based capital ratio is or greater  and its leverage ratio is or greater  and it is not subject to any order or directive by the ots to meet a specific capital level 
when appropriate  the ots can require corrective action by a savings association holding company under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law 
at march   the bank was considered well capitalized by the ots 
limitation on capital distributions 
the ots imposes various restrictions on the bank s ability to make capital distributions  including cash dividends  payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares and other distributions charged against capital 
a savings institution that is the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company  such as the bank  must file a notice with the ots at least days before making a capital distribution 
however  the bank must file an application for prior approval if the total amount of its capital distributions including each proposed distribution  for the applicable calendar year would exceed the bank s net income for that year plus the bank s retained net income for the previous two years 
the bank may not pay dividends to the holding company if  after paying those dividends  the bank would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements or the ots notified the bank that it was in need of more than normal supervision 
the bank is prohibited from making capital distributions if the bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution  the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns  or the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute  regulation or agreement 
liquidity 
the bank maintains liquidity levels to meet operational needs 
in the normal course of business  the levels of liquid assets during any given period are dependent on operating  investing and financing activities 
cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and repurchase agreements with maturities of three months or less are the bank s most liquid assets 
the bank maintains a liquidity policy to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operations 

table of contents branching 
subject to certain limitations  federal law permits the bank to establish branches in any state of the united states 
the authority for the bank to establish an interstate branch network would facilitate a geographic diversification of the bank s activities 
this authority under federal law and ots regulations preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings associations 
community reinvestment 
under cra  as amended  as implemented by ots regulations  the bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for the bank nor does it limit the bank s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
cra does  however  require the ots  in connection with its examination of the bank  to assess the bank s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the bank 
in particular  the system focuses on three tests a lending test  to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its assessment areas  an investment test  to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects  affordable housing and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses  and a service test  to evaluate the institution s delivery of banking services through its branches  atm centers and other offices 
cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
the bank received an outstanding cra rating in its most recent examination conducted in regulations require that carver federal publicly disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of cra 
the holding company has no such agreements in place at this time 
transactions with related parties 
the bank s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates and insiders is limited by ots regulations and by sections a  b  g and h of the federal reserve act fra 
in general  these transactions must be on terms which are as favorable to the bank as comparable transactions with non affiliates 
additionally  certain types of these transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the bank s capital 
collateral in specified amounts must usually be provided by affiliates to receive loans from the bank 
in addition  ots regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary 
the bank s authority to extend credit to its directors  executive officers  and shareholders  as well as to entities controlled by such persons  is currently governed by the requirements of sections g and h of the fra and regulation o of the frb 
among other things  these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders a be made on terms that are substantially the same as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and b not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons  individually and in the aggregate  which limits are based  in part  on the amount of the bank s capital 
in addition  extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the bank s board 
at march   there were no loans to officers or directors 
the frb has confirmed its previous interpretations of sections a and b of the fra with regulation w 
the ots has also conformed its regulations to agree with regulation w 
regulation w made various changes to existing law regarding sections a and b  including expanding the definition of what constitutes an affiliate subject to sections a and b and exempting certain subsidiaries of state chartered banks from the restrictions of sections a and b 

table of contents the ots regulations provide for additional restrictions imposed on savings associations under section of hola  including provisions prohibiting a savings association from making a loan to an affiliate that is engaged in non bank holding company activities and provisions prohibiting a savings association from purchasing or investing in securities issued by an affiliate that is not a subsidiary 
the ots regulations also include certain specific exemptions from these prohibitions 
the frb and the ots expect each depository institution that is subject to sections a and b to implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with regulation w and the ots regulation 
these regulations have had no material adverse effect on the bank s business 
section of the sarbanes oxley act prohibits the extension of personal loans to directors and executive officers of issuers as defined in the sarbanes oxley act 
the prohibition  however  does not apply to mortgages advanced by an insured depository institution  such as the bank  that is subject to the insider lending restrictions of section h of the fra 
assessment 
the ots charges assessments to recover the cost of examining savings associations and their affiliates 
these assessments are based on three components the size of the association  on which the basic assessment is based  the association s supervisory condition  which results in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic assessment for any savings institution with a composite rating of   or in its most recent safety and soundness examination  and the complexity of the association s operations  which results in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic assessment for any savings association that managed over billion in trust assets  serviced for others loans aggregating more than billion  or had certain off balance sheet assets aggregating more than billion 
effective july   the ots adopted a final rule replacing examination fees for savings and loan holding companies with semi annual assessments 
for fiscal  carver paid million in ots assessments 
enforcement 
the ots has primary enforcement responsibility over the bank 
this enforcement authority includes  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers 
in general  these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
standards for safety and soundness 
the ots has adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards 
the guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
in addition  ots regulations authorize  but do not require  the ots to order an institution that has been given notice that it is not satisfying these safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan 
if  after being so notified  an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan  the ots must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized association is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law 
if an institution fails to comply with such an order  the ots may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 
insurance of deposit accounts the fdic merged the savings association insurance fund and the bank insurance fund to create the depositors insurance fund dif on march  the bank is a member of the dif and pays its deposit insurance assessments to the dif 
effective january   the fdic established a new risk based assessment system for determining the deposit insurance assessments to be paid by insured depository institutions 
under this new assessment system  the fdic assigns an institution to one of four risk categories  with the first category having two sub categories  based on the institution s most recent supervisory ratings and capital ratios 
base assessment rates range from two to four basis points for risk category i institutions and are seven basis points for risk category ii institutions  twenty five basis points for risk category iii institutions and forty basis points for risk category iv institutions 
for institutions within risk category i  assessment rates generally depend upon a combination of camels capital adequacy  asset quality  management  earnings  liquidity  sensitivity to market risk component ratings and financial ratios  or for large institutions with long term debt issuer ratings  assessment rates depend on a combination of long term debt issuer ratings and camels component ratings 
the fdic has the flexibility to adjust rates  without further notice and comment rulemaking  provided that no such adjustment can be greater than three basis points from one quarter to the next  that adjustments cannot result in rates more than three basis points above or below the base rates and that rates cannot be negative 
effective january   the fdic set the assessment rates at three basis points above the base rates 
therefore  assessment rates ranged from two to forty five basis points of deposits 
as of march   the bank had an assessment rate of seven basis points 

table of contents the deposit insurance assessment rates are in addition to the assessments for payments on the bonds issued in the late s by the financing corporation to recapitalize the now defunct federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
the financing corporation payments will continue until the bonds mature in through the bank s expense for these payments totaled million in and million in the fdic also established of estimated insured deposits as the designated reserve ratio of the dif 
the fdic is authorized to change the assessment rates as necessary  subject to the previously discussed limitations  to maintain the designated reserve ratio of 
the fdic also provided for a one time credit for eligible institutions based on their assessment base as of december  subject to certain limitations with respect to institutions that are exhibiting weaknesses  credits can be used to offset assessments until exhausted 
the fdic has authority to adjust the dif ratio to insured deposits within a range of to  in contrast to the prior statutorily fixed ratio of 
the ratio  which is viewed by the fdic as the level that the fund should achieve  was established by the agency at for as a result of the recent failures of a number of banks and thrifts  there has been a significant increase in the loss provisions of the dif of the fdic 
this has resulted in a decline in the dif reserve ratio 
because the dif reserve ratio declined below and is expected to remain below  the fdic was required to establish a restoration plan to restore the reserve ratio to within five years 
to restore the reserve ratio to  the fdic has adopted a final rule increasing assessment rates uniformly by basis points annualized for the first quarter of and proposed other changes effective for the second quarter of under the proposed plan  beginning with the second quarter of  the initial base assessment rates will range from to basis points depending on an institution s risk category  with adjustments resulting in increased assessment rates for institutions with a significant reliance on secured liabilities and brokered deposits 
as currently written  the proposal will result in a significant increase in the bank s federal deposit insurance premiums which will have a material impact on the bank s results of operations beginning in for further discussion of the fdic restoration plan and proposal  see item a  risk factors 
on october   in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets  the fdic announced a temporary increase in deposit insurance from  to  per depositor through december   on november   the fdic adopted the temporary liquidity guarantee program  or tlgp  pursuant to its authority to prevent systemic risk in the u 
s banking system 
the tlgp was announced by the fdic on october  as an initiative to counter the system wide crisis in the nation s financial sector 
under the tlgp the fdic will guarantee  through the earlier of maturity or june   certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by participating institutions on or after october   and before june  under the debt guarantee program and fully insure non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts held at participating fdic insured institutions  through december  under the transaction account guarantee program 
eligible institutions were covered under the tlgp at no cost for the first days 
institutions that did not want to continue to participate in one or both parts of the tlgp were required to notify the fdic of their election to opt out on or before december  institutions that did not opt out are subject to a fee of up to basis points per annum based on the amount of senior unsecured debt issued under the debt guarantee program 
under the transaction account guarantee program  a basis point surcharge will be added to the institution s current insurance assessment  quarterly  for balances in non interest bearing transaction accounts that exceed the existing deposit insurance limit of  the tlgp was due to expire in june of  however  on february  the fdic announced its intention to extend the tlgp through october for an additional premium 
carver federal has elected to participate in both components of the tlgp 

table of contents on january   in an effort to further strengthen the financial system and u 
s economy  the fdic announced that it will soon propose rule changes to the tlgp to extend the maturity of the guarantee from three to up to years where the debt is supported by collateral and the issuance supports new consumer lending 
until the details of this extended program are finalized and published  the bank cannot determine to what extent  if any  it would participate in this program 
the fdic has authority to increase insurance assessments 
a significant increase in insurance premiums would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the bank 
management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
anti money laundering and customer identification the bank is subject to ots regulations implementing the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of usa patriot act 
the usa patriot act gives the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures  expanded surveillance powers  increased information sharing  and broadened anti money laundering requirements 
by way of amendments to the bank secrecy act  title iii of the usa patriot act takes measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies 
further  certain provisions of title iii impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions  including banks  thrifts  brokers  dealers  credit unions  money transfer agents and parties registered under the united states commodity exchange act of  as amended 
title iii of the usa patriot act and the related ots regulations impose the following requirements with respect to financial institutions performance of a risk assessment and establishment of a board approved policy 
designation of a qualified bsa officer 
establishment of an effective training program 
establishment of anti money laundering programs 
establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts  including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time 
establishment of enhanced due diligence policies  procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering 
prohibition on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with record keeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks 
in addition  bank regulators are directed to consider a holding company s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on fra and bank merger act applications 

table of contents federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the fhlb ny  which is one of the twelve regional banks composing the fhlb system 
each regional bank provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions 
the bank  as a fhlb ny member  is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlb ny in an amount equal to the greater of i of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans  home purchase contracts and similar obligations at the beginning of each year  and ii or such greater fraction as established by the fhlb ny of its outstanding advances from the fhlb ny 
the bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in the capital stock of the fhlb ny at march  of million 
any advances from the fhlb ny must be secured by specified types of collateral  and all long term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance 
fhlb ny is required to provide funds for the resolution of insolvent thrifts and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs 
these requirements could reduce the amount of earnings that the fhlb ny can pay as dividends to its members and could also result in the fhlb ny imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to its members 
if dividends were reduced  or interest on future fhlb ny advances increased  the bank s net interest income would be adversely affected 
dividends from fhlb ny to the bank amounted to million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the dividend rate paid on fhlb ny stock at march  was 
under the gramm leach bliley act  as amended glb  which  among other things  repeals historical restrictions and eliminates many federal and state law barriers to affiliations among banks and securities firms  insurance companies and other financial service providers  membership in the fhlb system is now voluntary for all federally chartered savings banks such as the bank 
glb also replaces the existing redeemable stock structure of the fhlb system with a capital structure that requires each fhlb to meet a leverage limit and a risk based permanent capital requirement 
two classes of stock are authorized class a redeemable on six months notice and class b redeemable on five years notice 
pursuant to regulations promulgated by the federal housing finance board  as required by glb  the fhlb has adopted a capital plan that will change the foregoing minimum stock ownership requirements for fhlb stock 
under the new capital plan  each member of the fhlb will have to maintain a minimum investment in fhlb capital stock in an amount equal to the sum of the greater of  or of the member s mortgage related assets and of the dollar amount of any outstanding advances under such member s advances  collateral pledge and security agreement with the fhlb ny 
federal reserve system frb regulations require federally chartered savings associations to maintain non interest earning cash reserves against their transaction accounts primarily now and demand deposit accounts 
a reserve of is to be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts between million and million subject to adjustment by the frb plus a reserve of subject to adjustment by the frb between and against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of million 
the first million of otherwise reservable balances subject to adjustment by the frb is exempt from the reserve requirements 
the bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements 
since required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash  a non interest bearing account at a federal reserve bank or a pass through account as defined by the frb  the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce carver federal s interest earning assets 
fhlb system members are also authorized to borrow from the federal reserve discount window  but frb regulations require institutions to exhaust all fhlb sources before borrowing from a federal reserve bank 
pursuant to the eesa  the frb announced on october   that the federal reserve banks will begin to pay interest on depository institutions required and excess reserve balances 
paying interest on required reserve balances should essentially eliminate the opportunity cost of holding required reserves  promoting efficiency in the banking sector 
the interest rate paid on required reserve balances is currently the average target federal funds rate over the reserve maintenance period 
the rate on excess balances will be set equal to the lowest target federal funds rate in effect during the reserve maintenance period 
the payment of interest on excess reserves will permit the federal reserve to expand its balance sheet as necessary to provide the liquidity necessary to support financial stability 

table of contents privacy protection carver federal is subject to ots regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of glb 
these regulations require the bank to disclose its privacy policy  including identifying with whom it shares nonpublic personal information  to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter 
the regulations also require the bank to provide its customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect its privacy policies and practices 
in addition  to the extent its sharing of such information is not exempted  the bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt out of having the bank share their nonpublic personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information  subject to certain exceptions 
the bank is subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information 
these regulations implement certain provisions of glb 
the guidelines describe the agencies expectations for the creation  implementation and maintenance of an information security program  which would include administrative  technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities 
the standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information  protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer 
the bank has a policy to comply with the foregoing guidelines 
holding company regulation 
the holding company is a savings and loan holding company regulated by the ots 
as such  the holding company is registered with and is subject to ots examination and supervision  as well as certain reporting requirements 
in addition  the ots has enforcement authority over the holding company and its subsidiaries 
among other things  this authority permits the ots to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of a subsidiary savings institution 
unlike bank holding companies  federal savings and loan holding companies are not subject to any regulatory capital requirements or to supervision by the frb 
glb restricts the powers of new unitary savings and loan holding companies 
unitary savings and loan holding companies that are grandfathered  ie  unitary savings and loan holding companies in existence or with applications filed with the ots on or before may   such as the holding company  retain their authority under the prior law 
all other unitary savings and loan holding companies are limited to financially related activities permissible for bank holding companies  as defined under glb 
glb also prohibits non financial companies from acquiring grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding companies 
restrictions applicable to all savings and loan holding companies 
federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company  including the holding company  directly or indirectly  from acquiring control as defined under hola of another savings institution or a holding company parent without prior ots approval  through merger  consolidation  or purchase of assets  another savings institution or a holding company thereof  or acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of such institution or a holding company  without prior ots approval  or control of any depository institution not insured by the fdic except through a merger with and into the holding company s savings institution subsidiary that is approved by the ots 

table of contents a savings and loan holding company may not acquire as a separate subsidiary an insured institution that has a principal office outside of the state where the principal office of its subsidiary institution is located  except in the case of certain emergency acquisitions approved by the fdic  if such holding company controls a savings institution subsidiary that operated a home or branch office in such additional state as of march   or if the laws of the state in which the savings institution to be acquired is located specifically authorize a savings institution chartered by that state to be acquired by a savings institution chartered by the state where the acquiring savings institution or savings and loan holding company is located or by a holding company that controls such a state chartered association 
the hola prohibits a savings and loan holding company directly or indirectly  or through one or more subsidiaries from acquiring another savings association or holding company thereof without prior written approval of the ots  acquiring or retaining  with certain exceptions  more than of a non subsidiary savings association  a non subsidiary holding company  or a non subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the hola  or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not federally insured 
in evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations  the ots must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved  the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds  the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors 
federal securities laws the holding company is subject to the periodic reporting  proxy solicitation  tender offer  insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the securities exchange act of  as amended exchange act 
delaware corporation law the holding company is incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware 
thus  it is subject to regulation by the state of delaware and the rights of its shareholders are governed by the general corporation law of the state of delaware 
federal and state taxation federal taxation general 
the holding company and the bank currently file consolidated federal income tax returns  report their income for tax return purposes on the basis of a taxable year ending march st  using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions  including in particular the bank s tax reserve for bad debts discussed below 
the following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the bank or the holding company 
bad debt reserves 
prior to fiscal  the bank met the requirement as a small bank one with assets having an adjusted tax basis of million or less and was permitted to maintain a reserve for bad debts  and to make  within specified formula limits  annual additions to the reserve which are deductible for purposes of computing the bank s taxable income 
since fiscal year  the bank has not been considered to be a small bank because its total assets have exceeded million 
see income taxes note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
distributions 
to the extent that the bank makes non dividend distributions to shareholders  such distributions will be considered to result in distributions from the bank s base year reserve  ie  its reserve as of march   to the extent thereof and then from its supplemental reserve for losses on loans  and an amount based on the amount distributed will be included in the bank s taxable income 
non dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the bank s current and accumulated earnings and profits  distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation 
however  dividends paid out of the bank s current or accumulated earnings and profits  as calculated for federal income tax purposes  will not constitute non dividend distributions and  therefore  will not be included in the bank s taxable income 

table of contents the amount of additional taxable income created from a non dividend distribution is an amount that  when reduced by the tax attributable to the income  is equal to the amount of the distribution 
thus  approximately one and one half times the non dividend distribution would be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes  assuming a federal corporate income tax rate 
dividends received deduction and other matters 
the holding company may exclude from its income of dividends received from the bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations 
the corporate dividends received deduction is generally in the case of dividends received from unaffiliated corporations with which the holding company and the bank will not file a consolidated tax return  except that if the holding company or the bank owns more than of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend  then of any dividends received may be deducted 
state and local taxation state of new york 
the bank and the holding company are subject to new york state franchise tax on their entire net income or one of several alternative bases  whichever results in the highest tax 
entire net income means federal taxable income with adjustments 
if  however  the application of an alternative minimum tax based on taxable assets allocated to new york  alternative net income  or a flat minimum fee results in a greater tax  an alternative minimum tax will be imposed 
the company was subject to the alternative minimum tax based upon assets for new york state for fiscal in addition  new york state imposes a tax surcharge of of the new york state franchise tax  calculated using an annual franchise tax rate of which represents the annual franchise tax rate  allocable to business activities carried on in the metropolitan commuter transportation district 
these taxes apply to the holding company  carver federal and certain of carver s subsidiaries 
the bank and the holding company file combined returns and are subject to taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions  including the bank s deductions for additions to its reserve for bad debts 
for fiscal  the new york state franchise tax rate based upon entire net income was including the metropolitan commuter transportation district surcharge of net income 
in general  the holding company is not required to pay new york state tax on dividends and interest received from the bank or on gains realized on the sale of bank stock 
sixty percent of dividend income  and gains and losses from subsidiary capital are excluded from new york state entire net income 
distributions to carver federal received from cac are eligible for the new york state dividends received deduction 
however  the holding company was subject to a franchise tax rate of including the metropolitan commuter transportation district surcharge for fiscal based upon alternative entire net income 
for this purpose  alternative entire net income is determined by adding back of dividend income  and gains and losses from subsidiary capital to new york state entire net income 
new york state has enacted legislation that enabled the bank to avoid the recapture of the new york state tax bad debt reserves that otherwise would have occurred as a result of the changes in federal law and to continue to utilize either the federal method or a method based on a percentage of its taxable income for computing additions to its bad debt reserve 
new york city 
the bank and the holding company are also subject to a similarly calculated new york city banking corporation tax of on income allocated to new york city 
in this connection  legislation was enacted regarding the use and treatment of tax bad debt reserves that is substantially similar to the new york state legislation described above 
the bank and the holding company also are subject to new york city banking corporation tax of on alternative entire net income allocated to new york city 
in addition  the bank and the holding company were subject to the alternative minimum tax for new york city which is similar to the new york state alternative minimum tax for fiscal delaware taxation 
as a delaware holding company not earning income in delaware  the holding company is exempted from delaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the state of delaware

item a 
risk factors 
risk is an inherent part of carver s business and activities 
the following is a summary of risk factors relevant to the company s operations which should be carefully reviewed 
these risk factors do not necessarily appear in the order of importance 
changes in interest rate environment may negatively affect carver s net income  mortgage loan originations and valuation of available for sale securities 
the company s earnings depend largely on the relationship between the yield on interest earning assets  primarily mortgage  construction and business loans and mortgage backed securities  and the cost of deposits and borrowings 
this relationship  known as the interest rate spread  is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors which influence market interest rates  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of non performing assets 
fluctuations in market interest rates affect customer demand for products and services 
carver is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than its interest earning assets 
in addition  the actual amount of time before mortgage  construction and business loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in mortgage prepayment rates and prevailing market interest rates 
mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors  including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated  seasonal factors  demographic variables and the ability to assume the underlying mortgages 
however  the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates  related loan refinancing opportunities and competition 
the company s objective is to fund its liquidity needs primarily through lower costing deposit growth 
however  from time to time carver federal borrows from the fhlb ny 
more recently  the cost of deposits and borrowings have become significantly higher with the rising interest rate environment  which has negatively impacted net interest income 

table of contents interest rates do and will continue to fluctuate 
the federal open market committee  or fomc  reduced the federal funds rate by basis points during the second half of and then an additional basis points during bringing the target rate to to 
the bank cannot predict future fomc or frb actions or other factors that will cause rates to change 
no assurance can be given that further changes in interest rates or further increases in mortgage loan prepayments will not have a negative impact on net interest income  net interest rate spread or net interest margin 
the estimated fair value of the company s available for sale securities portfolio may increase or decrease depending on changes in interest rates 
carver federal s securities portfolio is comprised primarily of adjustable rate securities 
there has been an improvement in valuation of the bank s available for sale securities because interest rates have declined in fiscal carver s results of operations are affected by economic conditions in the new york metropolitan area 
at march   a majority of the bank s lending portfolio was concentrated in the new york metropolitan area 
as a result of this geographic concentration  carver s results of operations are largely dependent on economic conditions in this area 
decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans to its borrowers 
adverse changes in the economy caused by inflation  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond the bank s control may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely mortgage or business loan payments  which would have an adverse impact on earnings 
consequently  deterioration in economic conditions in the new york metropolitan area could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the bank s loan portfolio  which could result in increased delinquencies  decreased interest income results as well as an adverse impact on loan loss experience with probable increased allowance for loan losses 
such deterioration also could adversely impact the demand for products and services  and  accordingly  further negatively affect results of operations 
the bank is operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment  both nationally and locally 
financial institutions continue to be affected by sharp declines in the real estate market and constrained financial markets 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the ongoing economic recession  including job losses  could have an adverse effect on the bank s borrowers or their customers  which could adversely affect the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans 
at march   the average loan to value ratio of the bank s mortgage loan portfolio was less than based on current principal balances and original appraised values 
however  no assurance can be given that the original appraised values are reflective of current market conditions as the bank has experienced declines in real estate values in all markets in which it lends 
the bank has experienced increases in loan delinquencies and charge offs in fiscal the bank s non performing loans  which are comprised primarily of mortgage loans  increased million to million  or of total loans  at march   from million  or of total loans  at march  the bank s net loan charge offs totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the bank s provision for loan losses totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a residential lender  carver federal is particularly vulnerable to the impact of a severe job loss recession 
significant increases in job losses and unemployment will have a negative impact on the financial condition of residential borrowers and their ability to remain current on their mortgage loans 
a continuation or further deterioration in national and local economic conditions  including an accelerating pace of job losses  particularly in the new york metropolitan area  could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the bank s loan portfolio  which could result in further increases in loan delinquencies  causing a decrease in the bank s interest income as well as an adverse impact on the bank s loan loss experience  causing an increase in the bank s allowance for loan losses and related provision and a decrease in net income 
such deterioration could also adversely impact the demand for the bank s products and services  and  accordingly  the bank s results of operations 
no assurance can be given that these conditions will improve or will not worsen or that such conditions will not result in a decrease in the bank s interest income or an adverse impact on loan losses 

table of contents strong competition within the bank s market areas could hurt expected profits and slow growth 
the new york metropolitan area has a high density of financial institutions  of which many are significantly larger than carver federal and with greater financial resources 
additionally  various large out of state financial institutions may continue to enter the new york metropolitan area market 
all are considered competitors to varying degrees 
carver federal faces intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
competition for loans  both locally and in the aggregate  comes principally from mortgage banking companies  commercial banks  savings banks and savings and loan associations 
most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations and credit unions 
the bank also faces competition for deposits from money market mutual funds and other corporate and government securities funds as well as from other financial intermediaries such as brokerage firms and insurance companies 
market area competition is a factor in pricing the bank s loans and deposits  which could reduce net interest income 
competition also makes it more challenging to effectively grow loan and deposit balances 
the company s profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in its market areas 
the bank s increased emphasis on non residential  construction real estate lending and small business lending may increase exposure to lending risks 
at march   million  or  of the bank s total loans receivable portfolio consisted of non residential and construction real estate loans compared to million  or  at march  non residential and construction real estate loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than one to four family loans because they typically have larger balances and are more sensitive to changes in the economy 
payments on these loans often depend upon the successful operation and management of the underlying properties and the businesses which operate from within them  repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower s control  such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
while the bank continues to originate multi family and commercial real estate loans  under current economic conditions  the bank has strengthened its underwriting guidelines 
as of march   carver federal is primarily offering to originate multi family and commercial real estate loans to select customers in new york and new jersey 
the market for multi family and commercial real estate loans does and will continue to change based upon market conditions and other factors  thereby  affecting the bank s election to pursue the originations of such loans in the future 
at march   million  or  of the bank s total loans receivable consisted of business loans compared to million  or  at march  business loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than one to four family loans because they typically have larger balances and are more sensitive to changes in the economy 
payments on these loans often depend upon the successful operation and management of the underlying business  repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower s control  such as adverse economic conditions  increased competition or changes in government regulation see note of notes consolidated financial statements 
the bank operates in a highly regulated industry  which limits the manner and scope of business activities 
carver federal is subject to extensive supervision  regulation and examination by the ots  the fdic  and  to a lesser extent  by the new york state banking department 
as a result  the bank is limited in the manner in which the bank conducts its business  undertakes new investments and activities and obtains financing 
this regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and depositors  and not to benefit the holding company s stockholders 
this regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to capital levels  the timing and amount of dividend payments  the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
in addition  the bank must comply with significant anti money laundering and anti terrorism laws 
government agencies have substantial discretion to impose significant monetary penalties on institutions which fail to comply with these laws 

table of contents on october   the ots and other federal bank regulatory authorities published the interagency guidance on nontraditional mortgage product risk  or the guidance 
in general  the guidance applies to all residential mortgage loan products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal or interest 
the guidance describes sound practices for managing risk  as well as marketing  originating and servicing nontraditional mortgage products  which include  among other things  interest only loans 
the guidance sets forth supervisory expectations with respect to loan terms and underwriting standards  portfolio and risk management practices and consumer protection 
for example  the guidance indicates that originating interest only loans with reduced documentation is considered a layering of risk and that institutions are expected to demonstrate mitigating factors to support their underwriting decision and the borrower s repayment capacity 
specifically  the guidance indicates that a lender may accept a borrower s statement as to the borrower s income without obtaining verification only if there are mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for direct verification of repayment capacity and that  for many borrowers  institutions should be able to readily document income 
the bank has evaluated the guidance for compliance  risk management practices and underwriting guidelines as they relate to originations and purchases of the subject loans  or practices relating to communications with consumers 
the guidance has no impact on the company s loan origination and purchase volumes or the company s underwriting procedures currently or in future periods 
efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act involve significant expenditures  and non compliance with the sarbanes oxley act may adversely affect the bank 
the sarbanes oxley act of  and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the sec increase the scope  complexity and cost of corporate governance  reporting  and disclosure practice 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  greater compliance costs  including design  testing and audit costs related to internal controls  as a result of the sarbanes oxley act 
for example  under section of sarbanes oxley  the company s management is required to issue a report on the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
beginning with carver s fiscal  carver s management will also be required to file an auditor s attestation report on the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
the company expects the implementation of these new rules and regulations to continue to increase its accounting  legal  and other costs  and to make some activities more difficult  time consuming  and costly 
in the event that the company is unable to maintain or achieve compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and related rules  carver s profitability and the market price of carver s stock may be adversely affected 
in addition  the rules adopted as a result of the sarbanes oxley act could make it more difficult or more costly for the company to obtain certain types of insurance  including directors and officers liability insurance  which could make it more difficult for the company to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on the company s boards of directors or as executive officers 
changes in laws  government regulation and monetary policy may have a material effect on results of operations 
financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future  none of which is in the company s control 
significant new laws or changes in  or repeals of  existing laws  including with respect to federal and state taxation  may cause results of operations to differ materially 
in addition  cost of compliance could adversely affect carver s ability to operate profitably 
further  federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for carver federal  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system 
a material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on carver federal  and therefore on the company s results of operations 

table of contents on october   president bush signed the eesa into law in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets 
pursuant to the eesa  the treasury has the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of troubled assets including mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the treasury  the frb and the fdic issued a joint statement announcing additional steps aimed at stabilizing the financial markets 
first  the treasury announced the tarp cpp  a billion voluntary capital purchase program available to qualifying financial institutions that sell preferred shares to the treasury to be funded from the billion authorized for troubled asset purchases 
second  the fdic announced that its board of directors  under the authority to prevent systemic risk in the us banking system  approved the tlgp  which is intended to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by permitting the fdic to guarantee certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by participating institutions under the debt guarantee program and fully insure non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts held at participating fdic insured institutions  regardless of dollar amount  under the transaction account guarantee program 
third  to further increase access to funding for businesses in all sectors of the economy  the frb announced further details of its commercial paper funding facility  or cpff  which provides a broad backstop for the commercial paper market 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the actual impact that the foregoing or any other governmental program will have on the financial markets 
the failure of any such program or the us government to stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions and the national and regional economy is expected to materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit and the trading price of the holding company s common stock 
pursuant to carver s participation in the tarp cpp  the company entered into certain agreements with the treasury that limit the company s activities in a number of ways and gives the treasury the ability to impose additional restrictions as it determines 
for example  the company s ability to declare or pay dividends on any of carver s shares is restricted 
specifically  the company is not able to declare dividends payments on common  junior preferred or pari passu preferred shares if it is in arrears on the dividends on the senior preferred shares issued to the treasury 
further  the company is not permitted to increase dividends on common stock without the treasury s approval until the third anniversary of the investment unless the senior preferred stock issued to the treasury has been redeemed or transferred 
in addition  the company s ability to repurchase shares of common stock is prohibited without the treasury s prior consent until the third anniversary of the investment or until the senior preferred stock issued to the treasury has been redeemed or transferred 
further  common  junior preferred or pari passu preferred shares may not be repurchased if the company is in arrears on the dividends on the senior preferred shares issued to the treasury 
in addition  the company must also adopt the treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity issued under this program 
these standards would generally apply to the company s ceo  cfo and the three next most highly compensated officers senior executives 
the standards include ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution  required claw back of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive based on statements of earnings  gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate  prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives  and agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of  for each senior executive 
in particular  the change to the deductibility limit on executive compensation would likely increase slightly the overall cost of the company s compensation programs 
the fdic recently adopted a restoration plan and issued a notice of proposed rulemaking and request for comment that would initially raise the assessment rate schedule  uniformly across all four risk categories into which the fdic assigns insured institutions  by seven basis points annualized of insured deposits beginning on january  under the proposed plan  beginning with the second quarter of  the initial base assessment rates will range from to basis points depending on an institution s risk category  with adjustments resulting in increased assessment rates for institutions with a significant reliance on secured liabilities and brokered deposits 
under the proposal the fdic may continue to adopt actual rates that are higher without further notice and comment rulemaking subject to certain limitations 
if the fdic determines that assessment rates should be increased  institutions in all risk categories could be affected 
the fdic has exercised this authority several times in the past and could continue to raise insurance assessment rates in the future 
the increased deposit insurance premiums proposed by the fdic are expected to result in a significant increase in the bank s non interest expense  which will have a material impact on the bank s results of operations beginning in on may   fdic voted to levy a special assessment on insured institutions as part of the agency s efforts to rebuild the dif and help maintain public confidence in the banking system 
the final rule establishes a special assessment of five basis points on each fdic insured depository institution s assets  minus its tier capital  as of june  the special assessment will be collected september  
table of contents management expects to face increased regulation and supervision of the banking industry as a result of the existing financial crisis  and there will be additional requirements and conditions imposed on the company to the extent that it participates in any of the programs established or to be established by the treasury or by the federal bank regulatory agencies 
such additional regulation and supervision may increase the company s costs and limit the company s ability to pursue business opportunities 
the company is subject to certain risks with respect to liquidity 
liquidity refers to the company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support operations and to fulfill obligations  including commitments to originate loans  to repay wholesale borrowings  and to satisfy the withdrawal of deposits by customers 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated through the repayment of loans and securities  cash flows from the sale of loans and securities  deposits gathered organically through the bank s branch network  from socially motivated depositors  city and state agencies  and borrowed funds  primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings from the fhlb ny 
in addition  and depending on current market conditions  the company has the ability to access the capital markets from time to time 
deposit flows  calls of investment securities and wholesale borrowings  and prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates  whether actual or perceived  local and national economic conditions  and competition for deposits and loans in the markets the bank serves 
furthermore  changes to the fhlb ny s underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings may limit or restrict the bank s ability to borrow  and could therefore have a significant adverse impact on liquidity 
a decline in available funding could adversely impact the bank s ability to originate loans  invest in securities  and meet expenses  or to fulfill such obligations as repaying borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands 
the bank s ability to pay dividends or lend funds to the holding company is subject to regulatory limitations which may prevent the holding company from making future dividend payments or principal and interest payments on its debt obligation 
carver is a unitary savings and loan association holding company regulated by the ots and almost all of its operating assets are owned by carver federal 
carver relies primarily on dividends from the bank to pay cash dividends to its stockholders  to engage in share repurchase programs and to pay principal and interest on its trust preferred debt obligation 
the ots regulates all capital distributions by the bank to the company  including dividend payments 
as the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company  carver federal must file a notice or an application depending on the proposed dividend amount with the ots prior to each capital distribution 
the ots will disallow any proposed dividend that would result in failure to meet the ots minimum capital requirements 
based on carver federal s current financial condition  it is not expected that this provision will have any impact on the company s receipt of dividends from the bank although it is possible 
payment of dividends by carver federal may also be restricted at any time  at the discretion of the ots  if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
pursuant to carver s participation in the tarp cpp  the company entered into certain agreements with the treasury that limit the company s activities in a number of ways and provide the treasury the ability to impose additional restrictions as it determines 
for example  the holding company s ability to declare or pay dividends on any of its shares is restricted 
specifically  the company is not able to declare dividends payments on common  junior preferred or pari passu preferred shares if it is in arrears on the dividends on the senior preferred shares issued to the treasury 
further  the company is not permitted to increase dividends on common stock without the treasury s approval until the third anniversary of the investment unless the senior preferred stock issued to the treasury has been redeemed or transferred 
in addition  the company s ability to repurchase shares of common stock is prohibited without the treasury s prior consent until the third anniversary of the investment or until the senior preferred stock issued to the treasury has been redeemed or transferred 
further  common  junior preferred or pari passu preferred shares may not be repurchased if the company is in arrears on the dividends on the senior preferred shares issued to the treasury 

table of contents carver may not be able to utilize its income tax benefits 
the company s ability to utilize the deferred tax asset generated by new markets tax credit income tax benefits over the next five years  as well as other deferred tax assets  depends on its ability to meet the nmtc compliance requirements and its ability to generate sufficient taxable income from operations or from potential tax strategies to generate taxable income in the future 
since the bank has not generated sufficient taxable income to utilize tax credits previously recognized  a deferred tax asset has been recorded in the company s financial statements 
for additional information regarding carver s nmtc  refer to item  new markets tax credit award 
carver faces system failure risks and security risks 
the computer systems and network infrastructure the company and its third party service providers use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
fire  power loss or other failures may effect carver s computer equipment and other technology  or that of the company s third party service providers 
also  the company s computer systems and network infrastructure could be damaged by hacking and identity theft which could adversely affect the results of carver s operations  or that of the company s third party service providers 
the bank may be required to record a charge to earnings if goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  if impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets is determined  the bank may be required to record a charge to earnings in the period of such determination 
the bank commenced an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the second quarter of fiscal year  based on indications that the fair value of the bank s reporting unit may have declined below its carrying value as a result of factors such as the further decline in the bank s market capitalization relative to the book value of shareholders equity and the adverse market conditions impacting the financial services sector generally 
the company completed its interim impairment analysis during the third quarter ended december  a valuation specialist was engaged to assist management in its fair value assessment of goodwill 
as a result of the finalization of the goodwill impairment analysis the bank determined that goodwill was fully impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million 
however  the bank s tangible capital ratio and regulatory capital ratios were not affected by this non cash expense since goodwill is not included in these calculations 
the bank is not aware of any other impairment of its intangible assets 
the company s business could suffer if it fails to retain skilled people 
the company s success depends on its ability to attract and retain key employees reflecting current market opportunities and challenges 
competition for the best people is intense  and the company s size and limited resources may present additional challenges in being able to retain the best possible employees  which could adversely affect the results of operations 
a natural disaster could harm carver s business 
natural disasters could harm the company s operations directly through interference with communications  as well as through the destruction of facilities and financial information systems 
such disasters may also have an impact on collateral underlying the bank s loans 
the company may face higher insurance costs in the event of such disasters

the holding company s common stock has been listed on the nasdaq global market under the symbol carv since july  before that  the company s stock was listed on the american stock exchange under the symbol cny 
as of june   there were  shares of common stock outstanding  held by stockholders of record 
the following table shows the high and low per share sales prices of the common stock and the dividends declared for the quarters indicated 
high low dividend fiscal year june  september  december  march  high low dividend fiscal year june  september  december  march  each quarter the board meets to determine the dividend amount per share to be declared 
on may   the company s board of directors declared a cash dividend to shareholders for the fourth quarter of fiscal this dividend amount is consistent with dividends paid during the previous three quarters of fiscal any future decision to change the quarterly cash dividend will based on  among other things  the dividend payout ratio coupled with the bank s strategy to retain capital in the current economic environment 
as in the past  the company s board of directors reviews the payment of dividends quarterly and plans to continue to maintain a regular quarterly dividend in the future  dependent upon earnings  financial condition and other factors 
under ots regulations  the bank will not be permitted to pay dividends to the holding company on its capital stock if its regulatory capital would be reduced below applicable regulatory capital requirements or if its stockholders equity would be reduced below the amount required to be maintained for the liquidation account  which was established in connection with the bank s conversion to stock form 
the ots capital distribution regulations applicable to savings institutions such as the bank that meet their regulatory capital requirements permit  after not less than days prior notice to the ots  capital distributions during a calendar year that do not exceed the bank s net income for that year plus its retained net income for the prior two years 
since the bank incurred a net loss in fiscal  prior approval of the ots is required for any capital distribution to the holding company 
for information concerning the bank s liquidation account  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents unlike the bank  the holding company is not subject to ots regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to its stockholders  although the source of such dividends is dependent  primarily  upon capital distributions from the bank 
the holding company is subject to the requirements of delaware law  which generally limit dividends to an amount equal to the excess of the net assets of the company the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities over its statutory capital  or if there is no such excess  to its net profits for the current and or immediately preceding fiscal year 
on august  the holding company announced a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to  shares of its outstanding common stock 
as of march    shares of its common stock have been repurchased in open market transactions at an average price of per share 
the holding company intends to use repurchased shares to fund its stock based benefit and compensation plans and for any other purpose the board deems advisable in compliance with applicable law 
as a result of the company s participation in the tarp cpp  the us treasury s prior approval is required to make further repurchases

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
the company s results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  changes in accounting standards and actions of regulatory agencies 
executive summary the following overview should be read in conjunction with the company s management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation in its entirety 
the financial services industry is facing unprecedented challenges in the face of the current national and global economic crisis 
the global and us economies are experiencing significantly reduced business activity as a result of among other factors  disruptions in the financial system during the past year 
dramatic declines in the housing market during the past year  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities  have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions  and  in some cases  to fail 
the company is fortunate that the markets it serves have been impacted to a lesser extent than many areas around the country 
in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets  there have been several recent announcements of federal programs designed to purchase assets from  provide equity capital to  and guarantee the liquidity of the industry 
on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
the eesa authorizes the us treasury to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities  and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
the company did not materially originate or invest in sub prime assets and  therefore  does not expect to participate in the sale of any of its assets into these programs 
eesa also immediately increased the fdic deposit insurance limit from  to  through december  on october   the treasury announced that it will purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts 
under this program  known as the troubled asset relief program capital purchase program the tarp cpp  the treasury made billion of capital available from the billion authorized by the eesa to us financial institutions in the form of preferred stock 
in conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock  the treasury will receive warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the preferred investment 
participating financial institutions will be required to adopt the treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity issued under the tarp cpp 
on january   the company announced that it completed the sale of million in preferred stock to the treasury in connection with carver s participation in the tarp cpp 
importantly  carver is exempt from the requirement to issue a warrant to the treasury to purchase shares of common stock  as the bank is a certified community development financial institution cdfi  conducting most of its depository and lending activities in disadvantaged communities 
therefore the investment will not dilute current common stock stockholders 
carver issued  shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a  with a liquidation preference of  per share 
the preferred stock investment represents approximately percent of carver s risk weighted assets as of march  resulting in the bank s capital ratios exceeding minimum regulatory capital requirements 
the treasury investment substantially increased the bank s capital ratios producing a tangible capital ratio of  core capital ratio of  and risk based capital ratio of 
the bank has used funds from tarp cpp to increase its securities and loan portfolios 

table of contents fiscal was a particularly challenging year for carver as it reported a net loss of million as compared to a profit of million in fiscal the net loss was primarily the result of a million provision for loan losses and a million goodwill impairment charge 
the provision for loan losses recorded during fiscal reflects the increase in and composition of loan delinquencies  non performing loans  net loan charge offs and overall loan portfolio  as well as evaluation of the continued deterioration of the housing and real estate markets and increasing weakness in the overall economy  particularly the accelerating pace of job losses 
at march  non performing loans represent of total loans as compared to at march  carver reported million in goodwill from its acquisition of community capital bank in based on indications that the fair value of the company s reporting unit declined below its carrying value as a result of factors such as the further decline in the company s market capitalization relative to the book value of shareholders equity and the adverse market conditions impacting the financial services sector generally the company determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million for fiscal net interest income was essentially flat from the prior year with a net interest margin decrease of basis points to 
during fiscal overall interest rates declined  however the bank was able to take advantage of its favorable asset liability position by matching the reduction in the yield on its interest earning assets with a reduction in its costs of interest bearing deposits 
as interest rates declined  the bank has benefited from the repricing of cd maturities and borrowings at significantly lower rates of interest offsetting the effect of the decline in the yields on loans and securities 
the business climate continues to present significant challenges  without a near term inflection point signaling recovery 
carver federal expects that loan growth will continue in fiscal as the opportunity for portfolio lending remains strong 
however  the bank expects to reduce the risk in its loan portfolio  given the very challenging credit environment  by curtailing the origination of construction loans for the time being  and refocusing on multifamily and non profit lending  which have historically produced low loss ratios  even during difficult economic times 
the bank expect deposit growth in fiscal  particularly as the intense competition for core community deposits which the bank experienced in prior years has recently abated 
carver federal intends to continue to focus on costs 
in fiscal  the bank took very difficult steps including eliminating of its workforce  closing a branch and outsourcing the residential loan division 
in fiscal year the bank is focused on additional efficiencies  targeting vendor consolidation 
however  industry wide increases in fdic insurance premiums coupled with potentially reduced dividends on fhlb ny stock will have a negative impact on fiscal earnings 
with respect to asset quality  continued weakness in the real estate market exacerbated by a severe downturn in the economy presents challenges for all financial institutions in the year ahead 
continued job losses coupled with declining real estate values may put increased pressure on the loan portfolio which may result in higher delinquencies and non performing loans in fiscal acquisition of community capital bank on september   the bank completed its acquisition of community capital bank  a brooklyn based new york state chartered commercial bank  with approximately million in assets and two branches  in a cash transaction totaling approximately million 
under the terms of the merger agreement  ccb s shareholders were paid per outstanding share including options which immediately vested with the consummation of the merger and the bank incurred an additional million in transaction related costs 
the transaction  which was accounted for under the purchase accounting method  included the recognition of approximately million of core deposit intangibles and million representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets goodwill 
as noted above  during fiscal the bank recorded and impairment charge for the entire amount of goodwill 

table of contents new markets tax credit award in june  carver federal was selected by the us department of treasury  in a highly competitive process  to receive an award of million in new markets tax credits 
the nmtc award is used to stimulate economic development in low to moderate income communities 
the nmtc award enables the bank to invest with community and development partners in economic development projects with attractive terms including  in some cases  below market interest rates  which may have the effect of attracting capital to underserved communities and facilitating the revitalization of the community  pursuant to the goals of the nmtc program 
the nmtc award provides a credit to carver federal against federal income taxes when the bank makes qualified investments 
the credits are allocated over seven years from the time of the qualified investment 
most recently  in may  carver federal received another award in the amount of million nmtc 
the bank is currently considering various options as to how to utilize this award 
recognition of the bank s million nmtc award began in december when the bank invested million  one half of its million award 
in december  the bank invested an additional million and transferred rights to million to an investor in a nmtc project 
the bank s nmtc allocation was fully invested as of december  during the seven year period  assuming the bank meets compliance requirements  the bank will receive of the million invested award amount in tax benefits over each of the first three years  and over each of the next four years 
the company expects to receive the remaining nmtc tax benefits of approximately million from its million investment over the next five years 
with the bank s most recent nmtc award in may  the utilization of this award allows the bank to receive additional nmtc tax benefits of on the million directly invested  or approximately million  over the next seven years 
critical accounting policies various elements of accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
carver s policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan losses is the most critical accounting policy 
this policy is important to the presentation of carver s financial condition and results of operations  and it involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments  which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in the company s results of operations or financial condition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s summary of significant accounting policies  including those related to allowance for loan losses  and an explanation of the methods and assumptions underlying their application 
securities impairment the bank s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
securities that the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the fair values of securities in the portfolio are based on published or securities dealers market values and are affected by changes in interest rates 
the bank quarterly reviews and evaluates the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other than temporary 
the bank generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary  which is consistent with its experience 
however  if such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary  the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged to earnings 
at march   the bank held a private label mortgage backed security which was determined to be other than temporarily impaired in the amount of thousand 

table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for probable loan losses inherent in the portfolio as of march  during the third quarter of fiscal  carver changed its loan loss methodology to be consistent with the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses released by the federal financial regulatory agencies on december  the change had an immaterial affect on the allowance for loan losses at march  management is responsible for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis  but may increase in frequency should conditions arise that would require management s prompt attention  such as business combinations and opportunities to dispose of non performing and marginally performing loans by bulk sale or any development which may indicate an adverse trend 
carver federal maintains a loan review system  which includes periodic review of its loan portfolio and the early identification of potential problem loans 
such system takes into consideration  among other things  delinquency status  size of loans  type of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers 
loan loss allowances are established for problem loans based on a review of such information and or appraisals of the underlying collateral 
on the remainder of its loan portfolio  loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including  but not limited to  actual loan loss experience  composition of loan portfolio  current economic conditions and management s judgment 
although management believes that adequate loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of the loan loss allowance may be necessary in the future 
the methodology employed for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of the following criteria establishment of loan loss allowance amounts for all specifically identified criticized and classified loans that have been designated as requiring attention by management s internal loan review process  bank regulatory examinations or carver federal s external auditors 
an average loss factor  giving effect to historical loss experience over several years and other qualitative factors  is applied to all loans not subject to specific review 
evaluation of any changes in risk profile brought about by business combinations  customer knowledge  the results of ongoing credit quality monitoring processes and the cyclical nature of economic and business conditions 
an important consideration in performing this evaluation is the concentration of real estate related loans located in the new york city metropolitan area 
all new loan originations are assigned a credit risk grade which commences with loan officers and underwriters grading the quality of their loans one to five under a nine category risk classification scale  the first five categories of which represent performing loans 
reserves are held based on actual loss factors based on several years of loss experience and other qualitative factors applied to the outstanding balances in each loan category 
all loans are subject to continuous review and monitoring for changes in their credit grading 
grading that falls into criticized or classified categories credit grading six through nine are further evaluated and reserved amounts are established for each loan based on each loan s potential for loss and include consideration of the sufficiency of collateral 
any adverse trend in real estate markets could seriously affect underlying values available to protect against loss 
other evidence used to support the amount of the allowance and its components includes amount and trend of criticized loans  actual losses  peer comparisons with other financial institutions  and economic data associated with the real estate market in the company s lending market areas 

table of contents a loan is considered to be impaired  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas  when it is probable that carver federal will be unable to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
carver federal tests loans covered under sfas for impairment if they are on non accrual status or have been restructured 
consumer credit non accrual loans are not tested for impairment because they are included in large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that  by definition  are excluded from the scope of sfas impaired loans are required to be measured based upon i the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s initial effective interest rate  ii the loan s market price  or iii fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan  an allowance must be established for the difference 
the allowance is established by either an allocation of the existing allowance for loan losses or by a provision for loan losses  depending on various circumstances 
allowances are not needed when credit losses have been recorded so that the recorded investment in an impaired loan is less than the loan valuation 
asset liability management the company s primary earnings source is net interest income  which is affected by changes in the level of interest rates  the relationship between the rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments  the level and composition of deposits and the credit quality of earning assets 
management s asset liability objectives are to maintain a strong  stable net interest margin  to utilize its capital effectively without taking undue risks  to maintain adequate liquidity and to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the economic environment is uncertain regarding future interest rate trends 
management monitors the company s cumulative gap position  which is the difference between the sensitivity to rate changes on the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  the company uses various tools to monitor and manage interest rate risk  such as a model that projects net interest income based on increasing or decreasing interest rates 
stock repurchase program refer to item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
discussion of market risk interest rate sensitivity analysis as a financial institution  the bank s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the bank s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which are short term in maturity 
since virtually all of the company s interest bearing assets and liabilities are held by the bank  most of the company s interest rate risk exposure is retained by the bank 
as a result  all significant interest rate risk management procedures are performed at the bank 
based upon the bank s nature of operations  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank does not own any trading assets 
carver federal seeks to manage its interest rate risk by monitoring and controlling the variation in repricing intervals between its assets and liabilities 
to a lesser extent  carver federal also monitors its interest rate sensitivity by analyzing the estimated changes in market value of its assets and liabilities assuming various interest rate scenarios 
as discussed more fully below  there are a variety of factors that influence the repricing characteristics of any given asset or liability 

table of contents the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific period if it will mature or reprice within that period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific period of time and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap could result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap could adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of rising interest rates a negative gap could adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap could result in an increase in net interest income 
as illustrated below  carver federal had a negative one year gap equal to of total rate sensitive assets at march  as a result  carver federal s net interest income may be negatively affected by rising interest rates and may be positively affected by falling interest rates 
the following table sets forth information regarding the projected maturities  prepayments and repricing of the major rate sensitive asset and liability categories of carver federal as of march  maturity repricing dates have been projected by applying estimated prepayment rates based on the current rate environment 
the information presented in the following table is derived in part from data incorporated in schedule cmr consolidated maturity and rate  which is part of the bank s quarterly reports filed with the ots 
the repricing and other assumptions are not necessarily representative of the bank s actual results

total rate sensitive assets loans mortgage backed securities federal funds sold investment securities total interest earning assets rate sensitive liabilities now accounts savings accounts money market accounts certificate of deposits borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap ratio of cumulative gap to total rate sensitive assets the table above assumes that fixed maturity deposits are not withdrawn prior to maturity and that transaction accounts will decay as disclosed in the table above 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the table above 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in the market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  generally have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
additionally  credit risk may increase as many borrowers may experience an inability to service their debt in the event of a rise in interest rate 
virtually all of the adjustable rate loans in carver federal s portfolio contain conditions that restrict the periodic change in interest rate 

table of contents net portfolio value npv analysis 
as part of its efforts to maximize net interest income while managing risks associated with changing interest rates  management also uses the npv methodology 
npv is the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets less the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of net expected cash inflows from existing financial derivatives and off balance sheet contracts 
under this methodology  interest rate risk exposure is assessed by reviewing the estimated changes in npv that would hypothetically occur if interest rates rapidly rise or fall along the yield curve 
projected values of npv at both higher and lower regulatory defined rate scenarios are compared to base case values no change in rates to determine the sensitivity to changing interest rates 
presented below  as of march   is an analysis of the bank s interest rate risk as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of basis points and basis points plus or minus changes in market interest rates 
such limits have been established with consideration of the impact of various rate changes and the bank s current capital position 
the bank considers its level of interest rate risk for fiscal  as measured by changes in npv  to be minimal 
the information set forth below relates solely to the bank  however  because virtually all of the company s interest rate risk exposure lies at the bank level  management believes the table below also similarly reflects an analysis of the company s interest rate risk dollars in thousands net portfolio value npv as of pv of assets change in rate amount change change npv ratio change bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp bp   bp bp   bp march  risk measures bp rate shock pre shock npv ratio npv as of pv of assets post shock npv ratio sensitivity measure decline in npv ratio bp certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented assumes that the composition of carver federal s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of carver federal s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on carver federal s net interest income and may differ from actual results 

table of contents average balance  interest and average yields and rates the following table sets forth certain information relating to carver federal s average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities and related yields for the years ended march the table also presents information for the fiscal years indicated with respect to the difference between the weighted average yield earned on interest earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  or interest rate spread  which savings institutions have traditionally used as an indicator of profitability 
another indicator of an institution s profitability is its net interest margin  which is its net interest income divided by the average balance of interest earning assets 
net interest income is affected by the interest rate spread and by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

comparison of financial condition at march  and assets at march  total assets decreased million  or  to million compared to million at march   primarily as a result of decreases of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of goodwill and million of other assets  partially offset by increases of million of investment securities and million of total loans receivable  net 
total loans receivable  net  including loans held for sale  increased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  the increase was primarily the result of an increase of million in commercial real estate loans and million in commercial business loans  offset by decreases in one to four family loans of million and construction loans of million 
the increase in commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans is reflective of the bank focus on the origination of these of loans due to their higher yields and shorter maturities than one to four family residential properties 
however  under the current economic environment  the bank has strengthened its underwriting guidelines 
at march   construction loans totaled million  a decrease of million  or  over fiscal construction loans represents of the loan portfolio and approximately of the bank s construction loans are participations in loans originated by community preservation corporation 
cpc is a non profit mortgage lender whose mission is to enhance the quality and quantity of affordable housing in the new york  new jersey  and connecticut tri state area 
the bank s construction lending activity is concentrated in the new york city market 
the decrease in construction loans is consistent with the bank s objective of deemphasizing construction loans and allow the remaining principal balances amortize down 

table of contents other assets decreased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march   primarily due to a deconsolidation of a million minority interest in a community development subsidiary in connection with the company s participation in the nmtc program 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  as the bank utilized excess liquidity for purchases of securities and origination of loans 
total securities increased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  available for sale securities increased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march   primarily due to purchases of us government guaranteed mortgage backed securities 
the bank has utilized capital from tarp cpp to purchased mortgage backed securities to offset the cost of the preferred dividends 
held to maturity securities decreased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march   primarily due to normal principal repayments and maturities of securities 
the bank s investment in fhlb ny stock increased by million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  the fhlb ny requires banks to own membership stock as well as borrowing activity based stock 
the increase in investment in fhlb ny stock was the result of new fhlb ny borrowings resulting in the purchase of stock during the period 
liabilities and stockholders equity liabilities at march   total liabilities increased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  the increase in total liabilities was primarily the result of an increase of million in advances from the fhlb ny and other borrowed money offset by a million reduction in deposits 
while the bank has been successful in retaining deposits  management made a strategic decision to allow higher cost certificates of deposit to run off and replaced them with lower cost borrowings 
deposits decreased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  the decrease in deposit balances was primarily the result of decreases in certificates of deposit of million  savings accounts of million and money market accounts of million  which were partially offset by an increase of million in now accounts and demand accounts of million 
advances from the fhlb ny and other borrowed money increased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  the increase in advances and other borrowed money was primarily the result of an increase of million in fhlb ny advances to replace higher cost certificates of deposit and to leverage the capital obtained in the tarp cpp 
minority interest decreased million as a result of deconsolidation of a subsidiary related to the new markets tax credits program

subprime loans on july   the ots and other federal bank regulatory authorities the agencies published the final interagency statement on subprime lending the statement to address emerging issues and questions relating to certain subprime mortgage lending practices 
although the agencies did not provide a specific definition of a subprime loan in the statement  the statement did highlight the agencies concerns with certain adjustable rate mortgage products offered to subprime borrowers that have one or more of the following characteristics low initial payments based on a fixed introductory rate that expires after a short period and then adjusts to a variable index rate plus a margin for the remaining term of the loan  very high or no limits on how much the payment amount or the interest rate may increase payment or rate caps on reset dates  limited or no documentation of borrowers income  product features likely to result in frequent refinancing to maintain an affordable monthly payment  and or substantial prepayment penalties and or prepayment penalties that extend beyond the initial fixed interest rate period 

table of contents in the expanded guidance for subprime lending programs  the agencies determined that  generally  subprime borrowers will display a range of credit risk characteristics that may include one or more of the following two or more day delinquencies in the last months  or one or more day delinquencies in the last months  judgment  foreclosure  repossession  or charge off in the prior months  bankruptcy in the last years  relatively high default probability as evidenced by  for example  a credit bureau risk score fico of or below depending on the product collateral  or other bureau or proprietary scores with an equivalent default probability likelihood  and or debt service to income ratio of or greater  or otherwise limited ability to cover family living expenses after deducting total monthly debt service requirements from monthly income 
the bank has minimal exposure to the subprime loan market and  therefore  does not expect the statement to have a material impact on the company 
at march   the bank s loan portfolio contained million in subprime loans of which million is non performing loans 
non interest income non interest income is comprised of depository fees and charges  loan fees and service charges  fee income from banking services and charges  gains or losses from the sale of securities  loans and other assets and other non interest income 
non interest income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase was primarily due to a nmtc transferred rights fee of million  gain on sale of securities of million  write down for the prior year period of loans held for sale of million  other income of million and an increase in loan fees and service charges of million 
the bank will receive additional non interest income over approximately the next eight years from this transaction 
further  as a result of the nmtc transaction  other income increased by million reflecting consolidation of income from minority interest 
in addition  the prior year period included a million charge associated with a balance sheet restructuring implemented to improve margins 
non interest expense non interest expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits of million  consulting expense of million  other expenses of million and net occupancy expense of million 
the increase in employee compensation and benefits is primarily due to the community capital bank acquisition and investments in new talent in the retail  lending and accounting units 
the million increase in consulting expense falls into three categories regulatory requirements preparation for compliance with sarbanes oxley act section and recent inter agency guidance on allowances for loan losses  strengthening the company s back office  including the accounting  lending and retail operations departments  by adding new staff and providing temporary expertise  and engaging consultants to assist the management team to analyze significant opportunities to improve financial results 
for example  the bank engaged consultants to conduct a rigorous business optimization review to help management identify further potential improvements in the bank s operations  in part through greater systems integration 
the million increase in other expense primarily consists of the cost of sub servicing of loans  atm expenses  charge offs and regulatory reporting costs 
the fiscal expense included million in merger related expenses 
income tax expense income tax benefit decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  resulting in a net tax benefit of million  which includes a minority interest tax expense of million 
the decrease in tax benefit reflects income before income taxes of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the income tax expense of million for fiscal was offset by the tax benefit generated by the nmtc investment totaling million

the company expects to receive additional nmtc tax benefits of approximately million from its million investment over approximately the next six years 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of the bank s ability to generate adequate cash to meet its financial obligations 
the principal cash requirements of a financial institution are to cover potential deposit outflows  fund increases in its loan and investment portfolios and ongoing operating expenses 
the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowed funds and principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are strongly influenced by changes in general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
carver federal monitors its liquidity utilizing guidelines that are contained in a policy developed by its management and approved by its board of directors 
carver federal s several liquidity measurements are evaluated on a frequent basis 
the bank was in compliance with this policy as of march  management believes carver federal s short term assets have sufficient liquidity to cover loan demand  potential fluctuations in deposit accounts and to meet other anticipated cash requirements 
additionally  carver federal has other sources of liquidity including the ability to borrow from the fhlb ny utilizing unpledged mortgage backed securities and certain mortgage loans  the sale of available for sale securities and the sale of certain mortgage loans 
net borrowings increased million during fiscal primarily as a result of the bank allowing higher cost certificates of deposit to runoff and replaced them with lower cost borrowings 
at march   the bank had million in borrowings with a weighted average rate of maturing over the next three years 
the bank has the flexibility to either repay or rollover these borrowings as they mature 
the continued disruption in the credit markets has not materially impacted the company s ability to access borrowings 
at march   based on available collateral held at the fhlb ny  carver federal had the ability to borrow from the fhlb ny an additional million on a secured basis  utilizing mortgage related loans and securities as collateral 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the level of these assets is dependent on the bank s operating  investing and financing activities during any given period 
at march  and  assets qualifying for short term liquidity  including cash and short term investments  totaled million and million  respectively 
the most significant liquidity challenge the bank faces is variability in its cash flows as a result of mortgage refinance activity 
when mortgage interest rates decline  customers refinance activities tend to accelerate  causing the cash flow from both the mortgage loan portfolio and the mortgage backed securities portfolio to accelerate 
in contrast  when mortgage interest rates increase  refinance activities tend to slow  causing a reduction of liquidity 
however  in a rising rate environment  customers generally tend to prefer fixed rate mortgage loan products over variable rate products 
because carver federal generally sells its one to four family year and year fixed rate loan production into the secondary mortgage market  the origination of such products for sale does not significantly reduce carver federal s liquidity 
the ots requires that the bank meet minimum capital requirements 
capital adequacy is one of the most important factors used to determine the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system 
at march   the bank exceeded all regulatory minimum capital requirements and qualified  under ots regulations  as a well capitalized institution 
see regulatory capital position below for certain information relating to the bank s regulatory capital compliance at march  the consolidated statements of cash flows present the change in cash from operating  investing and financing activities 
during fiscal  total cash and cash equivalents decreased by million reflecting cash provided by financing activities of million  and cash provided by operating of million  offset by investing activities of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  primarily resulting from increased borrowings of million and capital from tarp cpp of million  offset partially by reductions in deposits of million and the payment of common dividends of million 
net cash provided by operating activities during this period was million and was primarily the result of a decrease in other assets of million and changes in other non cash charges 
net cash used in investing activities was million  primarily representing purchases of available for sale securities of million as the bank leveraged the capital received from the tarp cpp

the bank was originally awarded million of nmtc 
in fiscal  the bank transferred rights to an investor in a nmtc project totaling million and recognized a gain on the transfer of rights of million 
the bank was required to maintain a 
interest in the entity with the investor owning the remaining 
the entity was called cde for financial reporting purposes  the million transfer of rights to an investor in a nmtc project was reflected in the other assets and the minority interest sections of the balance sheet as the entity to which the rights were transferred was required to be consolidated under fin r based on an evaluation of certain contractual arrangements between the bank and the investor 
in fiscal  following certain amendments to the agreement between ccdc and the investor that resulted in a reconsideration event under fin r  the bank deconsolidated the entity for financial statement reporting purposes 
however  under the current arrangement  the bank has a contingent obligation to reimburse the investor for any loss or shortfall incurred as a result of the ntmc project not being in compliance with certain regulations that would void the investor s ability to otherwise utilize tax credits stemming from the award 
the maximum possible loss to carver from such an arrangement is approximately million 
at march   carver has not recorded any liability with respect to this obligation in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 

table of contents with respect to the remaining million of nmtc awards  the bank has established various special purpose entities through which its investments in nmtc eligible activities are conducted 
as the bank is exposed to all of the expected losses and residual returns from these investments  the bank is deemed the primary beneficiary under fin r 
accordingly  all of these special purpose entities are consolidated in the bank s statement of financial condition as of march  and  resulting in the consolidation of assets of approximately million and million  respectively

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of carver federal s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on carver federal s performance than do the effects of the general level of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
