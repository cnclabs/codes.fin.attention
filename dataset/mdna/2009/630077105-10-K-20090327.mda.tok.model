item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we are an innovator in the field of metrology systems for the semiconductor manufacturing and other industries 
our systems are designed to precisely monitor film thickness and critical dimensions that are necessary to control the manufacturing process and provide increased production yields and performance 
capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors  especially in asia  are critical to our success 
purchases of our systems by these manufacturers are driven by the expected market demand for their new products and new applications 
the increasing complexity of the manufacturing processes for semiconductors is an important factor in the demand for our innovative metrology systems  as are the adoption of optical critical dimension ocd metrology across fabrication processes  adoption of immersion lithography and double patterning  adoption of new types of thin film materials and the need for improved process control to drive process efficiencies 
our strategy is to continue to innovate organically as well to evaluate strategic acquisitions in order to address business challenges and opportunities 
our revenues are primarily derived from product sales but are also derived from customer service and system upgrades for the installed base of our products 
in  we derived of our total net revenues from product sales and of our total net revenues from services 
important themes and significant trends the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by cyclical growth 
changing trends in the semiconductor industry continue to drive the need for metrology as a major component of manufacturing systems 
these trends include adoption of optical critical dimension metrology across fabrication processes 
our customers use photolithographic processes to create patterns on wafers 
critical dimensions must be carefully controlled during this process 
in advanced node device definition  additional monitoring of thickness and profile dimensions on these patterned structures at cmp  etch  and thin film processing is driving broader ocd adoption 
our proprietary ocd systems can provide the critical process control of these circuit dimensions that is necessary for successful manufacturing of these state of the art devices 

table of contents adoption of immersion lithography and development of double patterning for critical photolithographic layers 
in an effort to reduce costs and increase device performance  semiconductor manufacturers are decreasing both the die size and feature size 
both immersion processing and double patterning techniques are being implemented to achieve the requisite device linear dimension and density 
the additional rigors of these technologies increase the burden on overlay and registration capability as well as critical dimension monitoring and control 
these techniques are shrinking total available process windows faster than the scaling predicted by moore s law  resulting in the need for additional metrology and process control for both overlay and ocd systems 
adoption of new types of thin film materials 
the need for ever increasing device circuit speed coupled with lower power consumption has pushed semiconductor device manufacturers to begin the replacement of the traditional aluminum etch back interconnect flows as well as conventional gate dielectric materials  all which drive a broader adoption of thin film and ocd metrology systems 
to achieve greater semiconductor device speed  manufacturers have adopted copper in logic idm and it is now proliferating in next generation dram and flash nodes 
additionally  to achieve improved transistor performance in logic devices and higher cell densities in memory devices  new materials including high dielectric constant or high k gate materials are increasingly being substituted for traditional silicon oxide gate dielectric materials 
high k materials are comprised of complex thin films including layers of hafnium oxide and a bi layer of thin film metals 
our advanced metrology solutions are required for thickness control of these layers  which is critical to enable the device performance improvements that these new materials allow 
need for improved process control to drive process efficiencies 
competitive forces influencing semiconductor device manufacturers  such as price cutting and shorter product life cycles  place pressure on manufacturers to rapidly achieve production efficiency 
device manufacturers are using our integrated and standalone metrology systems throughout the fab to ensure that manufacturing processes scale rapidly  are accurate and can be repeated on a consistent basis 
reduced number of customers 
because of the escalating cost of mm manufacturing facilities  fewer semiconductor manufacturers can afford the significant investment in these next generation facilities 
therefore  fewer opportunities for semiconductors equipment companies exist 
given that the available number of potential customers is decreasing  pre existing customer relationships  product positioning and critical mass take on greater importance 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements conforms to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and judgments in applying our accounting policies that have an important impact on our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts  inventory valuations  warranty obligations and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from management s estimates 
we believe that the application of the following accounting policies requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenue includes hardware and also software that is incidental to the products as defined pursuant to aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition 
we derive 
table of contents revenue from three sources sales of process control metrology systems  spare part sales and  in certain arrangements  separately stated service contracts 
service revenue includes product upgrades 
our arrangements for sales of our systems often include customer specified objective acceptance criteria 
our systems include hardware and software that is incidental to the system 
we periodically review the software element of our equipment systems in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 applicability of sop to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  to ascertain that the software continues to be incidental 
for product sales to existing customers  revenue recognition occurs at the time title and risk of loss transfer  which usually occurs upon delivery  if we have reliably demonstrated that the product has successfully met the defined customer specified criteria  and all other recognition criteria has been met 
this occurs at the time of shipment  as our terms are fob shipping point 
for initial sales of product where we have not previously met the defined customer acceptance criteria  product revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the contractual acceptance period 
in japan  where our contractual terms with the customer specify risk of loss and title transfers upon customer acceptance  revenue is recognized upon receipt of written customer acceptance  provided all other recognition criteria have been met 
all of our products are assembled prior to shipment to our customers 
we often perform installation for our customers  however such installation is inconsequential and perfunctory as it may also be performed by third parties and is not considered essential to the functionality of the equipment 
revenue related to spare parts sales is recognized upon shipment and is included as part of service revenue 
service revenue also includes service contracts  spare parts  and non warranty and billable repairs of systems  and product upgrades 
whereas service revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the period under contract  service revenue related to billable repairs of systems is recognized as services are performed and service parts are delivered 
on occasion  customers request a warranty period longer than our standard month warranty 
in those instances where extended warranty services are separately quoted to the customer  we follow the guidance of financial accounting standards board technical bulletin  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts  associated revenue is deferred and recognized to income ratably over the term of the contract 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is included in deferred revenue 
furthermore  generally we do not provide our customers with any return rights 
the guidance in eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  is considered in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted at the same time 
in such cases  we defer the relative fair value of the undelivered element until that element is delivered and accepted by the customer 
in order to recognize revenue associated with delivered elements  the following criteria must be met a the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and c delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria  the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until the criteria have been met or all elements have been delivered to the customer 
objective and reliable evidence of the fair value is based on the amounts for which we sell equivalent products or services on a standalone basis 
upon recognition of product revenue  a liability is recorded for anticipated warranty costs 
service contracts may be purchased by the customer during or after the warranty period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of our customers 
where appropriate and available  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of customers when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors such as the length of time the receivables are past due  customary payment practices in the respective geographies and our historical collection experience with customers 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our risk associated with 
table of contents smaller rather than larger customers and that our reported allowances are adequate 
if however  the financial conditions of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  we would assess the necessity to record additional allowances which would result in additional general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage  or saleable only for amounts that are less than their carrying amounts 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our market  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
we have established inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales of usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
for demonstration inventory  we also consider the age of the inventory and potential cost to refurbish the inventory prior to sale 
demonstration inventory is amortized over its useful life and the amortization expense is included in total depreciation and amortization on our cash flow statement 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for our products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional reserves may be required 
inventories delivered systems we reflect the cost of systems that were invoiced upon shipment but deferred for revenue recognition purposes separate from our inventory held for sale as inventories delivered systems 
product warranties we sell the majority of our products with a twelve month repair or replacement warranty from the date of acceptance which generally represents the date of shipment 
we provide an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based upon the historical relationship of warranty costs to the cost of products sold 
the estimated future warranty obligations related to product sales are reported in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
the estimated future warranty obligations are affected by the warranty periods  sales volumes  product failure rates  material usage and labor and replacement costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage  labor or replacement costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty obligations would be required 
for new product introductions where limited or no historical information exists  we may use warranty information from other previous product introductions to guide us in estimating our warranty accrual 
the warranty accrual represents the best estimate of the amount necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty reserve and adjust the amounts in accordance with changes in these factors 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives while goodwill and indefinite lived assets are not amortized but tested annually for impairment 
our impairment review process is completed as of the last day of november of each year or whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that an impairment might have occurred 
sfas provides for a two step approach to determining whether and by how much goodwill has been impaired 
the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of nanometrics reporting units product and service to its net book value 
if the fair value is greater  then no impairment is deemed to have occurred 
if the fair value is less  then the second step must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of actual impairment 

table of contents the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
in estimating the fair value of nanometrics  we make estimates and judgments about future revenues and cash flows for each reporting unit 
to determine the fair value  our review process includes the income method and is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates including the following for each reporting unit revenue  based on assumed market growth rates and our assumed market share  estimated costs  and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business s weighted average cost of capital 
our estimates of market segment growth  our market segment share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information 
we also consider our market capitalization on the dates of our impairment tests in determining the fair value of the respective businesses 
as part of the second step in determining the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  we allocate the fair value of the reporting units to all of its assets and liabilities as if the reporting units had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting units was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit over the amount assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
when impairment is deemed to have occurred  we will recognize an impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of our goodwill to its implied fair value 
income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes based on sfas  accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax accounting for assets and liabilities 
also  deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether or not a valuation allowance is appropriate 
factors used in this determination include future expected income and the underlying asset or liability which generated the temporary tax difference 
our income tax provision is primarily impacted by federal statutory rates  state and foreign income taxes and changes in our valuation allowance 
stock based compensation upon adoption of sfas r  share based payment  on january   we began estimating the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected term of options granted is calculated based on the simplified method allowed by staff accounting bulletin and extended by staff accounting bulletin the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price 
restructuring charge during and  we implemented a restructuring program based on our business strategy and recorded significant accruals in connection with the restructuring program 
in connection with the plan we have recorded estimated expenses for severance and other costs 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  generally costs associated with restructuring activities have been recognized when they are incurred rather than the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
in addition post employment benefits accrued for workforce reductions related to restructuring activities are accounted for under sfas  employer s accounting post employment benefits 
a liability for post employment benefits is recorded when payment is probable  the amount is reasonably estimable  and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated 
given the significance and complexity of restructuring activities  and the timing of the execution of such activities  the restructuring process involves periodic reassessments of the estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating market conditions for expected disposals of assets and vacancy of space 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of the restructuring programs  actual results may vary or differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements see note of the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations the following table presents our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal years ended december   december  and december  fiscal year net revenues products service total net revenues costs of net revenues cost of products cost of service total costs of net revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring charge gain on sale of assets asset impairment total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense interest income interest expense other  net total other income expense  net loss before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss 
table of contents fiscal years  and ended december   december  and december   respectively total net revenues 
our net revenues were comprised of the following categories in thousands  except percent fiscal year change automated metrology materials characterization integrated systems total product revenue service total net revenues fiscal year change automated metrology materials characterization integrated systems total product revenue service total net revenues in  net revenues from automated metrology decreased by million and from integrated systems by million when compared to due to global reductions in capital spending by the majority of semiconductor manufacturers 
service revenue improved by million over primarily due to increased demand for ocd in the field upgrades to existing tools  as well as improved service field practices 
in  net revenues from automated metrology increased million as compared to reflecting demand for our automated and integrated products as semiconductor manufacturers continue to increase their manufacturing capacity 
also contributing to the higher revenues in was a full year of sales from accent and soluris related products 
incremental revenues from accent and soluris related products for  over the comparable levels  was million 
service revenue increased reflecting a full year of service activity from our accent and soluris acquisitions which contributed to higher sales of parts and services  due in part to a larger installed base of systems 
in addition  we experienced a higher level of in the field tool upgrades than in the previous year 
gross margins 
our gross margin breakdown was as follows in percent fiscal year products service the product gross margin in moved slightly downward from  from to  as a result of lower volume offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies 
service gross margin improved in from to  with the favorable contribution from in the field tool upgrades  which tend to achieve higher gross margins than our core service revenues  and our focus on controlling personnel related expenses 

table of contents the product gross margin increased in as compared to due to improved efficiencies achieved from both higher volumes and the integration of manufacturing operations for accent and soluris related products 
also  contributing to the higher gross margin in were lower warranty expenses of million due to improvements in product reliability 
the improvement in gross margin for service in reflects the favorable margin achieved from our in the field tool upgrades and our focus on controlling expenses including personnel  personnel related expenses and material costs as compared to operating expenses 
our operating expenses were comprised of the following categories in thousands fiscal year change research and development selling general and administrative amortization of intangible assets operating expenses before restructuring  impairment or gain on asset sale restructuring charge asset impairment gain on sale of assets total operating expenses fiscal year change research and development selling general and administrative amortization of intangible assets operating expenses before restructuring or gain on asset sale restructuring charge gain on sale of assets total operating expenses research and development 
the million decrease in research and development expenses in was primarily due to lower engineering materials costs of million  lower stock based compensation expense of million and reduced outside consulting fees related to the development of next generation stages of million 
the increase in research and development in of million reflected expenses for the full year related to the additional headcount and related development expenses associated with our acquisitions of accent in july and soluris in march  partially offset by lower stock based compensation charges of million 
selling 
selling expenses decreased by million in compared to contributing to the decrease were lower commission expenses of million and lower freight out  supplies  taxes and other costs of approximately million associated with the decrease in revenue 
depreciation expense decreased million for and costs for the company s taiwan pension plan decreased million for 
table of contents selling expenses increased million for the year over  reflecting expenses for the full year related to the additional headcount and related expenses associated with the acquisitions of accent in july and soluris in march  and also including higher commission expenses of million associated with higher revenue levels 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million in as a result of a million decrease in litigation expenses  a million decrease in headcount related expenses as a result of a contraction of our administrative staff headcount  and a million decrease in regulatory and compliance accounting costs 
these decreases were offset by increased stock based expense of million 
the decrease in litigation expenses resulted from the settlement of our patent infringement lawsuit with nova measuring during and the granting of a stay pending re examination of the patents in suit in the kla tencor litigation 
general and administrative expenses in increased slightly over the comparable period of as a result of termination charges for certain senior executives of million  consulting  travel and recruiting expenses of million and costs associated with enhancing our internal information technology infrastructure of million 
the increases were partially offset by lower legal expenses of million as we settled the patent litigation with nova in april  lower regulatory and accounting compliance costs of million and lower stock based compensation charges of million 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets for decreased million from the comparable period in as impairment charges were recorded in the second and third quarters of to reflect certain brand names  customer relationships and developed technology at their fair value in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
amortization associated with these intangible assets ceased in the second and third quarter of as we wrote off values to the asset impairment account 
amortization of intangible assets for increased million from the comparable period in due primarily to incurring amortization charges for the full year in as compared to incurring amortization for only a part of the year in  as the soluris acquisition closed in march and the accent acquisition closed in july restructuring charge 
restructuring costs decreased by million in the restructuring charges associated with and employees respectively for the first and third quarter of were million and million 
costs in included amounts associated with reductions in our global workforce and was aimed at improving our variable to fixed cost ratio and elimination of overlap within our business entities 
costs in of million were primarily associated with a write down of our milpitas  california machine shop and plating facility as part of a strategy to reverse manufacturing vertical integration and lower the breakeven point 
during the third quarter of  we announced that we would close our milpitas  california machine shop and plating facility as part of our mission to reverse our manufacturing vertical integration and lower our breakeven point 
in conjunction with this closure  we recorded a restructuring charge of million consisting of million write down of fixed assets  million for professional fees and million for severance payments 
no restructuring charges were recorded in asset impairment 
asset impairment charges of million were recorded in  resulting from write downs of goodwill  intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 

table of contents goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in a business combination 
in accordance with sfas goodwill is reviewed annually or whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
sfas provides for a two step approach to determining whether and by how much goodwill has been impaired 
the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the company reporting units  product and service to its net book value 
if the fair value is greater  then no impairment is deemed to have occurred 
if the fair value is less  then the second step must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of actual impairment 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
prior to performing step one of the goodwill impairment testing process for a reporting unit under sfas  if there is reason to believe that other non goodwill related intangible assets finite or indefinite lived and or long lived assets may be impaired  these other intangible assets and long lived assets must first be tested for impairment under sfas assets governed by sfas require a recoverability test whereby the gross undiscounted cash flows are determined specific to the asset 
if the sum of gross undiscounted cash flows for the fixed life intangible asset or long lived asset exceeds the carrying value of that asset  the test results in no impairment to the asset 
if not  then the fair value of the asset must be determined and the impairment is measured by the differential between the fair value and the carrying value 
for non goodwill related indefinite lived assets  a fair value determination is made 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value  then impairment occurs 
the carrying values of these assets are impaired as necessary to provide the appropriate carrying value for the goodwill impairment calculation 
as a result of a significant decrease in our net revenues and stock price during the second quarter  the company determined that indicators of impairment existed for our goodwill and long lived assets in the second quarter of accordingly  in accordance with sfas and sfas  the company performed impairment tests relative to its long lived assets and goodwill during the second quarter of for its reporting units  product and service 
as a result of this testing  while the company determined that there was no impairment of goodwill  the company recorded a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of million for intangible assets and million for other long lived assets during the second quarter during the third quarter  as a result of continued significant declines in the company s stock price and further evidence of the semiconductor industry being in a prolonged cyclical downturn  the company determined that indicators of impairment existed for our goodwill and long lived assets in the third quarter of accordingly  in accordance with sfas and sfas  the company performed impairment tests to its long lived assets and goodwill during the third quarter of for its reporting units  product and service 
as a result of this testing  the company determined and recorded a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of million for goodwill and million for intangible assets during the third quarter the million represented impairment of the goodwill balance 
the company also determined that there was no impairment of other long lived assets at the end of third quarter during the fourth quarter  due to the continued and prolonged semiconductor cyclical downturn  the company determined that indicators of impairment existed for our long lived assets and  in accordance with sfas  the company performed impairment tests to its long lived assets during the fourth quarter of the company determined that no impairment existed as of the end of fourth quarter for its long lived assets and intangible assets 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived assets is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
in estimating the fair value of these assets  the company made estimates and judgments about future revenues and cash flows 
the company s forecasts were based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates the company is using to manage the business 
changes in these estimates could change the company s conclusion regarding impairment of the long lived assets and potentially result in future impairment charges for all or a portion of their balance at december  
table of contents due to the decline in our forecasted revenues for certain product lines relating to specific intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions of accent optical technologies  inc and soluris  inc  as well as the weakening conditions in the semiconductor equipment market  the company performed an analysis in accordance with sfas the company performed step one of the impairment test for certain of its long lived assets as of june  and september   and determined that the net book value exceeded the undiscounted future cash flows for certain intangible assets 
accordingly  the company completed step two of the impairment analysis utilizing a present value technique to estimate the fair value of the impaired assets 
as a result of this analysis  in the second and third quarters of the company recorded million in impairment charges for intangible assets  of which million was developed technology  million was customer relationships  million was brand names and million was trade mark 
also in accordance with sfas  the company performed impairment tests for other long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment during the company performed an impairment analysis on its long lived assets associated with its machine shop and plating facility  which was subcontracted in  due to the significant reduction in forecasted future cash flows resulting from the operational limitations of the facility 
due to these reduced forecasts  the company performed step one of the impairment test for the machine shop and plating facility as of june   and determined that the net book value exceeded the undiscounted future cash flows 
accordingly  the company completed step two of the impairment analysis utilizing a present value technique to estimate the fair value of the impaired assets 
as a result of this analysis  an impairment charge of million was recorded in the second quarter of to reduce those assets to fair value 
the company also performed step one of the impairment test on the remainder of its long lived assets in the second  third  and fourth quarters of  and determined that no impairment existed 
after considering the results of the intangible and long lived asset impairments as determined under sfas  the company then proceeded with step one of its impairment testing of goodwill under sfas the company compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value and determined whether or not the reporting units were impaired as of june  and september  in  in estimating the fair value of the company  the company made estimates and judgments about future revenues and cash flows for each reporting unit 
to determine the fair value  the company s review process included the income method based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates including the following for each reporting unit revenue  based on assumed market growth rates and its assumed market share  estimated costs  and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business s weighted average cost of capital 
the company s estimates of market segment growth  market segment share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates it uses to manage the underlying businesses 
the company s business consists of both established and emerging technologies and its forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information 
the company also considered its market capitalization on the dates of its impairment tests in determining the fair value of the respective businesses 
the company completed the first step of the sfas test of its goodwill at june  and determined that the fair value of its reporting units was in excess of the net book value on that date  and hence there was no impairment of goodwill as of the end of our second quarter in accordance with sfas  the company concluded that events had occurred and circumstances had changed during the third quarter of which might indicate the existence of impairment indicators including a significant decline in the company s stock price and continued deterioration in the semiconductor equipment market and the related impact on revenue forecasts of each reporting unit 
consistent with the company s approach in its annual impairment testing  in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit  the company considered both the market approach and income approach 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on quoted market prices and the number of shares outstanding of the company s common stock 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
at september   the company determined that the fair value of its reporting units was 
table of contents less than the net book value of the net assets of each reporting unit and accordingly  the company performed step two of the impairment test 
in step two of the impairment test  the company determined the implied fair value of the goodwill and compared it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  the company allocated the fair value of the reporting units to all of its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting units was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amount assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the company s step two analysis resulted in no implied fair value of goodwill  and therefore  the company recognized an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of  representing a write off of the entire amount of the company s previously recorded goodwill including goodwill from the tevet acquisition which was a part of the impaired reporting units 
gain on the sale of assets 
in august we entered into a contract to sell a parcel of land and building in japan and realized a gain on the sale of million 
in addition  the sale of a condominium in california was consummated in july and we realized a gain of million in the third quarter of we also sold other non strategic assets during the third quarter of realizing a gain of million 
we had no asset sale gains in other income expense 
our net other income expense consisted of the following categories in thousands fiscal year change interest income interest expense other income expense   nm total other income expense  net   nm nm not meaningful fiscal year change interest income interest expense other income expense total other income expense  net interest income decreased slightly in as a result of slightly higher average cash and cash equivalent balances being offset by lower yields obtained on our investments 
higher interest expense in resulted from the issuance of debt obligations in the third quarter of and the sale of receivables without recourse in japan 
other income expense includes foreign exchange gains losses  commission income and rental income and miscellaneous expenses 
higher other income in resulted from foreign exchange gains due to exchange rate fluctuations associated with foreign entities balances denominated in non us currencies that were settled during  or for intercompany balances otherwise considered not permanent investments 
in  lower interest income is due to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances and lower yields obtained on our investments 
interest expenses relate to our debt obligations in japan  which were fully paid in july  and the united kingdom 
in addition we incur interest expense associated with the sale of our 
table of contents accounts receivable 
with the acquisition of accent in  we incurred foreign exchange losses due to exchange rate fluctuations associated with extensive intercompany balances assumed with the transaction 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the company s provision for income taxes for of million was primarily a result of foreign income taxes 
a benefit for income taxes in of million and in of million was primarily due to benefiting the losses of certain foreign jurisdictions where sufficient deferred tax liabilities exist 
our effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
in the future  we will continue to review our expectations for future taxable income to determine the amount of valuation allowance necessary to reserve against deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million compared to million as of december  at december   we had working capital of million compared to million at december  operating activities provided cash of million for the twelve month period ended december  resulting from our million net loss being offset by certain non cash charges including million of impairment charges for long lived assets  million of amortization and depreciation and million in stock based compensation  and increases attributable to changes in our net current assets and liabilities of million 
operating activities provided cash of million for the twelve month period ended december  resulting from our net loss of million being offset by certain non cash charges such as million of amortization and depreciation  million of stock based compensation and increases in working capital of million due primarily to increases in accounts receivable of million reflecting the increase in our revenues

table of contents in february  we entered into a two year agreement  subsequently extended until may  for a revolving line of credit facility with a maximum principal amount of up to million

all borrowings under this credit line bear interest  at our election  at a per annum rate equal to the bank s prime rate or at the london interbank offered rate or libor plus 
the revolving line of credit agreement includes a provision for the issuance of commercial or standby letters of credit by the bank on our behalf 
the value of all letters of credit outstanding reduces the total line of credit available 
the revolving line of credit is collateralized by a blanket lien on all of our domestic assets excluding intellectual property and real estate 
we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing under this credit facility for general corporate purposes 
while we anticipate we will renew the line of credit  the present economic conditions in the banking and financing industry are very volatile and uncertain 
we may be unable to renew the line of credit under the same general terms and conditions under which we presently operate 
in july  we entered into a loan agreement pursuant to which we borrowed million 
the loan initially bears interest at the rate of per annum  which rate will be reset after five years to over the then weekly average yield of five year us dollar interest rate swaps as published by the federal reserve 
monthly principal and interest payments are based on a twenty year amortization for the first sixty months and fifteen year amortization thereafter 
the remaining principal balance of the loan and any accrued but unpaid interest will be due on august  the loan is secured  in part  by a lien on and security interest in the building and land comprising our principal offices in milpitas  california

this forecast time horizon can vary among different suppliers

actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided 
in addition  the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or cancelled 
certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties
