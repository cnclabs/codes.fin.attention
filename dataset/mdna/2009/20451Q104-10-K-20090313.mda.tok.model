overview compass diversified holdings  a delaware statutory trust  was incorporated in delaware on november  compass group diversified holdings  llc  a delaware limited liability company  was also formed on november  in accordance with the trust agreement  the trust is sole owner of of the trust interests as defined in the llc agreement of the company and  pursuant to the llc agreement  the company has outstanding  the identical number of trust interests as the number of outstanding shares of the trust 
the manager is the sole owner of the allocation interests of the company 
the company is the operating entity with a board of directors and other corporate governance responsibilities  similar to that of a delaware corporation 
the trust and the company were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle market businesses headquartered in north america 
we characterize small to middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to million 
we focus on companies of this size because of our belief that these companies are often more able to achieve growth rates above those of their relevant industries and are also frequently more susceptible to efforts to improve earnings and cash flow 
in pursuing new acquisitions  we seek businesses with the following characteristics north american base of operations  stable and growing earnings and cash flow  maintains a significant market share in defensible industry niche ie  has a reason to exist  solid and proven management team with meaningful incentives  low technological and or product obsolescence risk  and a diversified customer and supplier base 
our management team s strategy for our subsidiaries involves utilizing structured incentive compensation programs tailored to each business to attract  recruit and retain talented managers to operate our businesses  regularly monitoring financial and operational performance  instilling consistent financial discipline  and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals  assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic cash flow growth strategies both revenue and cost related  identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities  and forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives 
based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions  we believe we are positioned to acquire additional attractive businesses 
our management team has a large network of over  deal intermediaries to whom it actively markets and who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions 
through this network  as well as our management team s active proprietary transaction sourcing efforts  we typically have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets 
in consummating transactions  our management team has  in the past  been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions  including corporate spin offs  transitions of family owned businesses  management buy outs and reorganizations 
we believe the flexibility  creativity  experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions provides us with a strategic advantage by allowing us to consider non traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target 
in addition  because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our revolving credit facility  we do not expect to be subject to delays in or conditions by closing acquisitions that would be typically associated with transaction specific financing  as is typically the case in such acquisitions 
we believe this advantage is a powerful one and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate

consolidated results of operations compass diversified holdings years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit staffing  selling  general and administrative expense management fees supplemental put expense amortization of intangibles operating income loss net sales on a consolidated basis net sales increased approximately million in the year ended december  compared to the increase is primarily attributable to increased revenues at cbs personnel resulting from the acquisition of staffmark on january  and net sales attributable to our majority owned subsidiary fox  also acquired in january million

refer to the following results of operations by segment for discussion and a more detailed analysis of net sales by segment 
we do not generate any revenues apart from those generated by the businesses we own 
we may generate interest income on the investment of available funds  but expect such earnings to be minimal 
our investment in our businesses is typically in the form of loans from the company to such businesses  as well as equity interests in those companies 
cash flows coming to the trust and the company are the result of interest payments on those loans  amortization of those loans and  in the future  potentially  dividends on our equity ownership 
however  on a consolidated basis these items will be eliminated 
cost of sales on a consolidated basis cost of sales increased approximately million in the year ended december  compared to and million in the year ended december  compared to these increases are due entirely to the corresponding increase in net sales referred to above

for the year ended december   and we incurred approximately million  million and million  respectively  in expense for these fees 
the increase in management fees in is principally due to the increase in consolidated adjusted net assets in as a result of cbs personnel s acquisition of staffmark in january and our acquisition of fox in january  offset in part by the sale of aeroglide and silvue in june the increase in management fees in compared to is principally due to incurring the management fee for four quarters in compared to only three in  on our initial businesses  and the increase in adjusted net assets as a result of the acquisitions  offset in part by the sale of crosman in january in connection with the acquisition of staffmark in january  cbs personnel paid approximately million during the year ended december  to a separate manager of staffmark  unrelated to cgm

the company accrued approximately million  million and million in expense during the years ended december   and  respectively  in connection with this agreement 
this expense represents that portion of the estimated increase in the fair value of our businesses over our original basis in those businesses that our manager is entitled to if the management services agreement were terminated or those businesses were sold see related party transactions 
amortization of intangibles on a consolidated basis  amortization expense of intangible assets increased approximately million in the year ended december  compared to and approximately million in the year ended december  compared to these increases are due entirely to the recognition of intangible assets and the attendant amortization directly related to the purchase price allocations performed for each of our acquisitions  since inception

adjustments to depreciation and amortization resulting from purchase allocations that were not pushed down to a business are not included 
we believe this presentation enhances the discussion and provides a more meaningful comparison of operating results 
the following operating results of our businesses are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year  going forward 
advanced circuits overview advanced circuits is a provider of prototype  quick turn and volume production pcbs to customers throughout the united states 
collectively  prototype and quick turn pcbs represent approximately of advanced circuits gross revenues 
prototype and quick turn pcbs typically command higher margins than volume production pcb s given that customers require high levels of responsiveness  technical support and timely delivery of prototype and quick turn pcbs and are willing to pay a premium for them 
advanced circuits is able to meet its customers demands by manufacturing custom pcbs in as little as hours  while maintaining over error free production rates and real time customer service and product tracking hours per day 
while global demand for pcbs has remained strong in recent years  industry wide domestic production has declined over since in contrast  advanced circuits revenues have increased steadily as its customers prototype and quick turn pcb requirements  such as small quantity orders and rapid turnaround  are less able to be met by low cost volume manufacturers in asia and elsewhere 
advanced circuits management anticipates that demand for its prototype and quick turn printed circuit boards will remain strong and anticipates that demand will be impacted less by current economic conditions than by its longer lead time production business  which is driven more by consumer purchasing patterns and capital investments by businesses

the increase in cost of sales was largely due to the increase in net sales 
gross profit as a percent of net sales increased by approximately to approximately for the year ended december  compared to approximately for the year ended december   largely as a result of increased production efficiencies  due to increased volume  offset in part by slight increases in raw material costs

american furniture overview founded in and headquartered in ecru  mississippi  american furniture is a leading us manufacturer of upholstered furniture  focused exclusively on the promotional segment of the furniture industry 
american furniture offers a broad product line of stationary and motion furniture  including sofas  loveseats  sectionals  recliners and complementary products  sold primarily at retail price points ranging between and american furniture is a low cost manufacturer and is able to ship any product in its line within hours of receiving an order on february    american furniture s million square foot corporate office and manufacturing facility in ecru  ms was partially destroyed in a fire 
approximately thousand square feet of the facility was impacted by the fire 
the executive offices were fundamentally unaffected 
the recliner and motion plant  although largely unaffected  suffered some smoke damage but resumed operations on february  there were no injuries related to the fire 
the company temporarily moved its stationary production lines into other facilities 
in addition to its thousand square foot flex facility  management secured thousand square feet of additional manufacturing and warehouse space in the surrounding pontotoc area 
these temporary stationary production facilities provided the company with approximately of the pre fire stationary production capabilities for the months of april  through november where orders for stationary products were addressed by these temporary facilities  whereas the orders for motion and recliner products were addressed by the production facilities that were largely unaffected by the fire at the ecru facility 
on november  the damaged manufacturing facility was fully restored and operating 
american furniture s products are adapted from established designs in the following categories i motion and recliner  ii stationary  iii occasional chair and  iv accent tables 
american furniture s products are manufactured from common components and offer proven select fabric options  providing manufacturing efficiency and resulting in limited design risk or inventory obsolescence 
results of operations the table below summarizes the results of operations for american furniture for the fiscal year ending december  and the pro forma results of operations for the year ended december  we acquired american furniture on august  the following operating results are reported as if we acquired american furniture on january  year ended december  pro forma in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses a management fees amortization of intangibles b income from operations prior period results of operations of american furniture for the year ended december  include the following pro forma adjustments a selling  general and administrative expenses were reduced by million  representing one time transaction costs incurred by the seller 
a a reduction in depreciation expense of million as a result of  and derived from  the purchase price allocation in connection with our acquisition of american furniture in august b a reduction in charges to amortization of intangible assets totaling million  as a result of  and derived from  the purchase price allocation in connection with our acquisition of american furniture in august fiscal year ended december  compared to pro forma fiscal year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million or 
stationary product sales decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in motion and recliner product sales decreased approximately million  while table and occasional sales decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in these decreases in sales are due principally to the fire that destroyed the finished goods warehouse and a large part of the manufacturing facility in february management believes that the softer economy in is also responsible  although to a lesser extent  for the decrease in sales volume 
we expect sales to continue to decline in as new housing starts continue to decline significantly and consumers continue to be faced with general economic uncertainty fueled by deteriorating consumer credit markets and lagging consumer confidence as a result of volatile and often erratic financial markets 
all of these factors have significantly impacted big ticket consumer purchases such as furniture 
cost of sales cost of sales decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period of and is due principally to the corresponding decrease in sales 
gross profit as a percent of sales was for the year ended december  compared to in the corresponding period in this decrease in margin is attributable to raw material price increases in  particularly foam and steel  and to a lesser extent labor inefficiencies incurred in the manufacturing recovery process due to multiple temporary production facilities being utilized for much of the year and associated overtime costs incurred  resulting from the fire in february as of november   we have rebuilt our primary production facility destroyed in the fire  and as such do not expect to incur additional labor inefficiency costs in the future 
recently  raw material prices for foam and steel have begun to decline 
if this decline continues we may realize lower raw material costs as a percent of total cost of sales in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased approximately million over the corresponding period in this decrease is primarily due to the business interruption insurance proceeds recorded during the period of approximately million 
also contributing to the decrease was a reduction of million in commissions paid and million in insurance expense during the period due to significant reduction in net sales caused by the fire 
these decreases were offset in part by increases in fuel costs of million and increases in property taxes and legal costs of million during the year ended december  compared to income from operations income from operations decreased approximately million for the year ended december  over the corresponding period in  primarily due to the decrease in net sales  related gross profit margins and other factors as described above 
anodyne overview anodyne  headquartered in coral springs  florida is a specialty designer  manufacturer and distributor of medical devices  specifically support surfaces and patient positioning devices and was formed in february to purchase the assets and operations of amf support surfaces  inc amf and sentech medical systems  inc sentech on february  on october   anodyne purchased a third manufacturer and distributor of patient positioning devices  anatomic concepts  inc anatomic 
anatomic operations were merged into the amf operations 
on june  anodyne purchased primatech medical systems  inc primatech  a distributor of medical support surfaces focusing on the lower price point long term and home care markets 
the medical support surfaces industry is fragmented and comprised of many small participants and niche manufacturers 
anodyne s consolidation platform marks the first opportunity for customers to source all leading support surface technologies for the acute care  long term care and home health care from a single source 
anodyne is a vertically integrated company with engineering  design and research  manufacturing and support performed in house to quickly bring new products to market and maintain strict quality standards

sales associated with primatech  which was purchased in june  accounted for million of this increase 
during the fourth quarter of  the general economic slowdown in the united states showed significant signs of contraction in health care capital budgets 
we expect this trend to continue through fiscal which may have a negative impact over the purchasing of support surfaces and patent positioning devices 
cost of sales cost of sales increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in and is principally due to the corresponding increases in sales  raw material costs and manufacturing infrastructure costs 
gross profit as a percent of sales decreased slightly to approximately for the year ended december  compared to in the same period of this decrease is due to increases in manufacturing infrastructure costs  raw materials and the timing between cost increases and sales price increases 
raw materials  particularly polyurethane foam and fabric generally represent approximately of cost of sales

these increases were offset in part by a reduction in costs totaling million  attributable to hollywood capital  a former management group that was comprised of the former ceo and cfo 
the hollywood capital management services agreement was terminated in october we expect annual savings of approximately million going forward as a result of terminating the hollywood capital arrangement 
amortization expense amortization expense increased approximately million in the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in  due principally to the full year impact of amortization in fiscal in connection with the intangible assets realized as part of the add on acquisition of primatech in june income from operations income from operations increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  principally as a result of the significant increase in net sales offset in part by higher infrastructure costs necessary to support the increase in sales volume and other factors described above

while no specific acquisitions are currently contemplated at this time  cbs personnel continues to view acquisitions as an attractive means to enter new geographic markets 
fiscal was a very difficult year for the temporary staffing industry 
the already weak economic conditions and employment trends in the us  present at the start of  continued to worsen as the year progressed 
the most notable deterioration occurred in the fourth quarter of as the economic slowdown became more evident 
according to the us bureau of labor statistics  during  the us economy lost million jobs  compared with million jobs created in and million in temporary staffing was impacted especially hard  posting consecutive months of year over year declines 
in fact  the rate of temporary job losses accelerated throughout the year  with the december drop being the highest in this cycle resulting in almost immediate deterioration of employment markets and temporary staffing

critical accounting estimates the following discussion relates to critical accounting policies for the company  the trust and each of our businesses 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap will require management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different conditions 
our critical accounting estimates are discussed below 
these critical accounting estimates are reviewed by our independent auditors and the audit committee of our board of directors 
supplemental put agreement in connection with our management services agreement  we entered into a supplemental put agreement with our manager pursuant to which our manager has the right to cause the company to purchase the allocation interests then owned by our manager upon termination of the management services agreement for a price to be determined in accordance with the supplemental put agreement 
we record the supplemental put agreement at its fair value quarterly by recording any change in value through the income statement 
the fair value of the supplemental put agreement is largely related to the value of the profit allocation that our manager  as holder of allocation interests  will receive 
the valuation of the supplemental put agreement requires the use of complex models  which require highly sensitive assumptions and estimates 
the impact of over estimating or under estimating the value of the supplemental put agreement could have a material effect on operating results 
in addition  the value of the supplemental put agreement is subject to the volatility of our operations which may result in significant fluctuation in the value assigned to this supplemental put agreement 
derivatives and hedging we utilize an interest rate swap derivative to manage risks related to interest rates on the last million of our term loan facility 
accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that  at inception and over the term of the arrangement  the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting 
the rules and interpretations related to derivatives accounting are complex 
failure to apply this complex guidance correctly will result in all changes in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings  without regard to the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
currently the change in fair value is reflected in other comprehensive income 
at december   derivative liabilities were million and represented the mark to market unrealized loss on our interest rate swap 
on february   the company terminated a portion of its swap in connection with the repayment of million of the term loan facility 
in connection with the termination  the company reclassified million from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings 
refer to note s of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
provisions for customer returns and other allowances based on historical experience are recognized at the time the related sale is recognized 
cbs personnel recognizes revenue for temporary staffing services at the time services are provided by cbs personnel employees and reports revenue based on gross billings to customers 
revenue from cbs personnel employee leasing services is recorded at the time services are provided 
such revenue is reported on a net basis gross billings to clients less worksite employee salaries  wages and payroll related taxes 
we believe that net revenue accounting for leasing services more closely depicts the transactions with its leasing customers and is consistent with guidelines outlined in emerging issue task force eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the effect of using this method of accounting is to report lower revenue than would be otherwise reported 
business combinations the acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  to be recorded as identifiable intangibles or goodwill 
the fair values are determined by our management team  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and other relevant information 
such information typically includes valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values requires significant judgment both by our management team and by outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets 
the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and or depreciation expense 
goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired 
trademarks are considered to be indefinite lived intangibles 
trademarks and goodwill are not amortized 
however  we are required to perform impairment reviews at least annually and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining certain assumptions used in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each of our reporting units based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which include allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is then compared to its corresponding carrying value 
the impairment test for trademarks requires the determination of the fair value of such assets 
if the fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and or intangible assets 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  and material adverse effects in relationships with significant customers 
given significant changes in the business climate in the fourth quarter of  we retested goodwill for impairment at two of our reporting units  cbs personnel and american furniture at december  in performing this test  we revised our estimated future cash flows  as appropriate  to reflect current market conditions and risk within these industries  as well as market data of our competitors 
in each case  no impairment was indicated at this time 
if market conditions continue to deteriorate in the markets that cbs personnel and american furniture operate  it is likely that we will be required to retest goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles which may result in write downs to their fair value 
the implied fair value of reporting units is determined by management and generally is based upon future cash flow projections for the reporting unit  discounted to present value 
we use outside valuation experts when management considers that it would be appropriate to do so 
intangible assets subject to amortization  including customer relationships  non compete agreements and technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets  which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever indications of impairment are present 
property and equipment are initially stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is principally computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
our estimated useful lives represent the period the asset is expected to remain in service assuming normal routine maintenance 
we review the estimated useful lives assigned to property and equipment when our business experience suggests that they may have changed from our initial assessment 
factors that lead to such a conclusion may include physical observation of asset usage  examination of realized gains and losses on asset disposals and consideration of market trends such as technological obsolescence or change in market demand 
we perform impairment reviews of property and equipment  when events or circumstances indicate that the value of the assets may be impaired 
indicators include operating or cash flow losses  significant decreases in market value or changes in the long lived assets physical condition 
when indicators of impairment are present  management determines whether the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets is less than the carrying amount of those assets 
in this circumstance  the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
the estimates of both the undiscounted future cash flows and the fair values of assets require the use of complex models  which require numerous highly sensitive assumptions and estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts on an entity by entity basis with consideration for historical loss experience  customer payment patterns and current economic trends 
the company reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis and adjusts the balance  if necessary 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment by management 
the impact of either over or under estimating the allowance could have a material effect on future operating results 
workers compensation liability cbs personnel is an employer with self insurance and large deductible plans for its worker s compensation exposure 
cbs personnel establishes reserves based upon its experience and expectations as to its ultimate liability for those claims using developmental factors based upon historical claim experience 
cbs personnel continually evaluates the potential for change in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries 
as of december   cbs personnel had approximately million in workers compensation liability related to claims  reserves and settlements 
the ultimate settlement of this liability could differ materially from the assumptions used to calculate this liability  which could have a material adverse effect on future operating results 
deferred tax assets several of our majority owned subsidiaries have deferred tax assets recorded at december  which in total amount to approximately million 
these deferred tax assets are comprised of reserves not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the temporary differences that have resulted in the recording of these tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
based upon the expected future results of operations  we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of existing temporary differences  although there can be no assurance of this 
the impact of not realizing these deferred tax assets would result in an increase in income tax expense for such period when the determination was made that the assets are not realizable 
see note m income taxes recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  or sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  any business combinations we engage in will be recorded and disclosed following existing gaap until january  we expect sfas no 
r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 
we are still assessing the impact of this standard on our future consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 or sfas  which we will adopt on january  sfas will significantly change the accounting and reporting related to a non controlling interest in a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a non controlling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the non controlling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its non controlling interest 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
after adoption  non controlling interests will be classified as shareholders equity  a change from its current classification between liabilities and shareholders equity 
earnings attributable to minority interests will be included in net income  although such earnings will continue to be deducted to measure earnings per share 
purchases and sales of minority interests will be reported in equity

by incorporating an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset in an inactive market 
fsp was effective on october  we have adopted provisions of sfas no 
and incorporated the considerations of this fsp in determining the fair value of our financial assets 
fsp did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity at december   we were exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowings under our credit agreement because borrowings under this agreement are subject to variable interest rates 
we had outstanding million under the term loan facility portion of our credit agreement at december  we fixed million of these outstanding borrowings on january  with a floating to fixed interest rate swap with a bank 
on february   we repaid million of our outstanding term loan facility and  in connection with this repayment  terminated million of our interest rate swap 
our exposure to fluctuation in variable interest on the remaining million is not deemed to be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
we expect to borrow under our revolving credit facility in the future in order to finance our short term working capital needs and future acquisitions 
exchange rate sensitivity at december   we were not exposed to significant foreign currency exchange rate risks that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk associated with cash equivalents  investments  and trade receivables 
we do not believe that our cash equivalents or investments present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  consists principally of i treasury and government securities money market funds  ii insured prime money market funds  iii fdic insured certificates of deposit  iv government insured commercial paper and  v cash balances in several non interest bearing checking accounts 
substantially all trade receivable balances of our businesses are unsecured 
the concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited by the large number of customers in our customer base and their dispersion across various industries and geographic areas 
although we have a large number of customers who are dispersed across different industries and geographic areas  a prolonged economic downturn could increase our exposure to credit risk on our trade receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses
