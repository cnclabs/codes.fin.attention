table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our future plans  estimates  beliefs and expected performance 
the forward looking statements are dependent upon events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly in cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and item a risk factors 
many of these factors are difficult to predict 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed may not occur 
overview we focus our oil and natural gas exploration  exploitation and developmental operations on projects located in the western united states 
we have funded our operations with a combination of  i cash received from the sale of our equity  and ii proceeds received from the sale of certain of our oil and gas assets  and we intend to increase stockholder value by profitably growing reserves and production primarily through drilling operations 
our company began oil and gas operations in january  with the purchase of interests in undeveloped acreage from two private companies denver  colorado based tower colombia corporation tcc and casper  wyoming based north finn llc 
in april  we completed a merger with tcc  and we currently retain a strategic alliance with north finn 
at december   we owned interests in approximately  gross  net acres primarily in the powder river basin of wyoming  in the williston basin of north dakota and in our bigfoot project in the rocky mountain region 
in addition to focusing on drilling within our existing projects  we expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our project portfolio 
we believe that our existing project portfolio provides us with the opportunity to rapidly grow reserves and cash flow if we are able to prove that our acreage positions can be developed in a commercial fashion 
a number of unprofitable wells may need to be drilled while we test various drilling  completion and stimulation methods 
we have been able to reduce or eliminate our financial exposure in the initial drilling in our projects by creating joint venture arrangements that provide for others to pay for all or a disproportionate share of the initial drilling costs 
this has allowed us to move forward in drilling a greater number of wells than if we were to drill these wells on our own 
we expect to continue to use industry relationships to partially or completely fund initial drilling 

table of contents within the main focus areas of our existing project portfolio  we expect the following drilling activity  and our share of the cost of that drilling activity to occur in approximate expected net expected working capital project wells interest required in millions fetter project converse county  wy to to goliath project williams county  nd to to bigfoot project to to total drilling activity to to while our base case drilling activity would result in drilling costs of approximately million  we may expand drilling activity to as much as million  if project economics and general economic conditions support the more aggressive drilling program 
if we elect to expand drilling activities  we may need to access additional capital 
we have no third party commitments to provide additional capital and there is no assurance such capital will be available to us  or if available  that the terms will be favorable to us 
we may access capital from equity and or debt offerings 
we have not entered into any commodity derivative arrangements or hedging transactions 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may enter into commodity swap and or hedging transactions in the future in conjunction with oil and gas production 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of current economic conditions the global and national economic and financial crises and the significant fall in oil and gas prices during the last few months of  combined with the risk that oil and gas prices may not recover in impacts us in many ways  most notably i decreasing our revenue as oil and gas is produced  ii potentially decreasing the value of our proved reserves and the value of our oil gas leases  iii potentially decreasing the opportunities in to profitably drill wells  and iv significantly contributing  we believe  to our operating losses in and to the decline in our stock price from per share at september  to per share at december  and per share on march  however  we do believe that the weakness in oil and gas prices should provide us with the opportunity to experience significant decreases in service costs relating to drilling  completing and operating oil and gas wells 
we anticipate that by combining decreases in services costs with enhanced production from our focus areas  we could drill commercially successful wells  even at current commodity price levels 
we begin with over million in working capital share  including million in cash and million in short term investments  no long term debt  approximately  net undeveloped acres of oil and gas leases of which only approximately  acres would expire in  even if we drill no wells in  improved opportunity for drilling commercially successful wells within the fetter and goliath projects  even at current commodity prices when taking into consideration current and expected further decreases in service costs  and plans to drill several shallow gas wells at our new bigfoot project that could be commercially successful under existing gas price conditions 
little employee turnover in and no turnover of officers or key managers  in light of the low oil and gas prices currently and the uncertainties of price recovery and financial market recovery  we expect in  to maintain a substantial portion of our cash in us treasuries and similar low risk  liquid investments  and we are planning to spend approximately million in for base case capital projects and operating expenses  as discussed further in the liquidity and capital resources section on pages to 
table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss attributable to common stockholders of  per common share  basic and diluted for the year ended december   as compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders of  per common share  basic and diluted for the year ended december  oil and gas operations for  we had total oil and gas revenues of  compared with  for oil and gas sales and production costs for each year are summarized in the table that follows 
oil sales volumes increased in compared with due to increased production from new north dakota wells producing in the bakken formation and from oil produced in conjunction with gas production from fetter gas wells 
gas sales volumes increased in over largely due to new wells in late and in at fetter and in north dakota 
year ended december  oil sold barrels average oil price oil revenue gas sold mcf average gas price gas revenue total oil and gas revenues less lease operating expenses less oil gas amortization expense less accretion of discount less impairments of oil and gas properties plus gain on sale of oil and gas properties income loss from oil and gas operations less general and administrative expenses less intangible asset amortization less depreciation of office facilities less impairment of goodwill add service fee revenue and other revenues income loss from operations total barrels of oil equivalent boe sold oil and gas revenue per boe sold lease operating expense per boe sold amortization expense per boe sold impairments of oil and gas properties we use the full cost accounting method  which requires recognition of an impairment of oil and gas properties when the total capitalized costs of oil and gas properties net of related deferred income tax liability exceed a ceiling 
in  we recorded  of such impairments in the last four months of the year  primarily due to approximately million of costs of three krejci wells evaluated in september in excess of their ceiling value  approximately million due to declines in oil and gas prices in the last five months of impacting ceiling components of wells with new proved reserves in and wells with proved reserves at december   approximately million for the cost of the hageman well at fetter in excess of its ceiling value and approximately million for performance revisions of proved reserves during such impairments are not reversed in the future to the extent the future ceiling exceeds the future capitalized costs of oil and gas property net of related deferred income tax liability 
additional impairments might arise in the future 
gain on sales in of oil and gas properties we recorded million in gain million after tax effect from the october sale  for million cash  of a our west douglas and douglas acreage located west and northwest of our fetter project and b a small western portion of our fetter project  where that portion bordered douglas acreage and lease rights previously held by the buyer 
in september  we sold for million cash our interests in the narraguinnep project in colorado and credited the gain to the full cost pool since non recognition of the gain did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved oil and gas properties 
the combined taxable gains from the sales totaled approximately million 

table of contents impairment of goodwill in we recorded  of goodwill in the acquisition  by merger  of tower colombia corporation tcc 
at december   we recognized an  full and permanent impairment of the goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  as further explained in note of our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
the goodwill was not an asset for income tax reporting  and its impairment did not reduce income taxes or increase deferred tax assets 
other income loss the table below summarizes the other income loss section of our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  and the year ended december  investment income from auction rate preferred shares and cash sweeps impairment of auction rate preferred shares interest expense  due to illiquidity in of auction rate preferred shares net income of auction rate preferred shares and cash sweeps losses on unregistered petrohunter common stock sold in and other interest expense total other income loss in  we sold all remaining shares of petrohunter common stock and had redeemed or sold at par value  of auction rate preferred shares 
at december   we owned  in auction rate preferred shares  with an estimated fair value of  and we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
substantially all of the million was held in cash accounts at wells fargo bank  na we expect that for most of approximately million of the million will be invested in a portfolio of us treasuries and highly liquid securities managed by a wells fargo affiliate 
we anticipate liquidating our remaining auction rate preferred shares before december   with some shares redeemed by their issuers and other shares sold in private sales at a loss approximating the recognized impairment of  income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded a  income tax reduction consisting of a  current income tax provision and a  deferred income tax benefit 
the  income tax reduction is of the million loss before income taxes for the effective income tax rate is substantially less than the combined statutory income tax rate for federal and state income taxes in the rate reduction is attributable to i recognition at december  of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of  and ii inability to ever deduct for income taxes the  goodwill impairment expense for financial reporting 
if in the future  facts and circumstances indicate that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset is likely to be realized  then the  valuation allowance would be correspondingly reduced and a deferred tax benefit correspondingly recognized 
dividends preferred dividends for the year ended december  were  compared with  for the decrease was due to the mandatory conversion of preferred shares into common shares on july  we recognized deemed dividends of  and  in and  respectively  for the fair value of extensions of certain warrants as described in note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
we had no preferred shares outstanding at december  and do not anticipate issuing shares in we may have  but do not anticipate having  extensions of warrants in 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  we recorded a net loss attributable to common stockholders of  per common share  basic and diluted for the year ended december   as compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of  
per common share  basic and diluted for the year ended december  for  we recognized  of other revenues but had no gains from property sales  no service fee revenues and no impairment expense 
included in the net income for are i  in gains  after tax effect from the sale of oil and gas properties  ii  in service fee revenue and iii impairment expense of  oil and gas operations for  we had total oil and gas revenues of  compared with  for oil and gas sales and production costs for each year are summarized in the table that follows 
oil sales volumes decreased in compared with due to the sale of our interests in the oil producing wells in the big sky project 
gas sales volumes increased in over largely due to gas produced and sold from a new well in our fetter project 
year ended december  oil sold barrels average oil price oil revenue gas sold mcf average gas price gas revenue total oil and gas revenues less lease operating expenses less oil gas amortization expense less accretion of discount less impairments plus gain on sale of oil and gas properties income from oil and gas operations less intangible asset amortization less depreciation of office facilities less general and administrative expenses add service fee revenue and other revenues income loss from operations total barrels of oil equivalent boe sold oil and gas revenue per boe sold lease operating expense per boe sold amortization expense per boe sold impairments we use the full cost accounting method  which requires recognition of an impairment of oil and gas properties when the total capitalized costs net of related deferred income taxes exceed a ceiling 
our initial ceiling test calculation as of december   using oil and gas prices on that date indicated an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties of approximately million  net of income tax 
however  sec guidance in applying the ceiling test allows for consideration of subsequent price increases prior to the filing of the form k 
with consideration of oil and gas prices at the end of february  the ceiling exceeded total capitalized costs  eliminating the calculated impairment 
as a result  we did not recognize an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties at december  under the full cost method of accounting 

table of contents for the year ended december   we recorded an impairment against our evaluated oil and gas properties in the amount of million 
a substantial portion of the impairment occurred during the fourth quarter and results from being unable to complete the fetter project state well in a fashion as originally planned  which reduced the estimate of proved reserves as of december  for the well 
we did not record any impairment for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses we recorded million and million in general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the million increase in compared with is due primarily to a  net increase in employee compensation and a  increase in costs of financial auditing and attestation of internal controls over financial reporting 
in  we increased our number of employees from thirteen to fifteen but reduced employee share based compensation by  
service fee revenue in in we received a  convertible note from gsl energy corp 
as a service fee for successfully assisting in acquiring additional montana lease acreage that was not suitable for our acreage portfolio 
we subsequently converted the  note into  shares of gsl common stock at per share 
gsl subsequently merged into publicly held petrohunter energy corp 
we did not generate any service fee revenue in or gains on sales in of oil and gas properties we recorded million in gains from the sale of oil and gas properties million after tax effect during the year ended december  the reconciliations of the gains on the sales are as follows big sky bear creek goliath totals contract sales price effective date adjustments adjusted sales price allocated capitalized costs using the relative fair market value method required under full cost accounting recognized gains on sales of oil and gas properties investment income we recorded  and  in investment income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in investment income results from higher short term interest rates in and from our short term investment of approximately million in net cash proceeds from the sale of common stock in april income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded a  provision for deferred income taxes and recorded a  provision for the year ended december  the  deferred tax reduction is of the  net loss for as compared to a combined statutory rate for federal and state income taxes 

table of contents dividends for the year ended december   we recorded  million from dividends attributable to our  shares of series aa convertible preferred stock  outstanding throughout for the year ended december   we recorded  of preferred stock dividends 
the decline from is due to approximately of preferred shares outstanding during being converted to common stock in early january in  we recorded  deemed dividends for the estimated fair value of warrant extensions in we had no warrant extensions in liquidity and capital resources we currently do not generate meaningful cash flow from our oil and natural gas operating activities  even though our future depends on our ability to generate oil and natural gas operating cash flow 
we recognize that net cash generated from operating activities is a function of production volumes and commodity prices  both of which are inherently volatile and unpredictable  as well as operating efficiency and capital spending 
our business is a depleting one in which each barrel of oil equivalent produced must be replaced or our asset base and capacity to generate revenues in the future will shrink 
our primary cash requirements are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
we have historically funded our oil and natural gas activities primarily through the sale of our equity  from the sale of certain oil and gas assets and to a lesser extent  internally generated cash flows 
due to our active oil and natural gas activities  we currently anticipate capital requirements in to be approximately million 
approximately million is allocated to our expected drilling and production activities  million is allocated to land  and geological and geophysical activities  and million relates to our general and administrative expenses 
we expect to be able to fund these capital expenditures  other commitments and working capital requirements with existing capital and expected cash flow from operations 
however  we may elect to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity 
we may expand or reduce our capital expenditures depending on  among other things  the results of future wells  and our available capital 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million consisting primarily of cash held in wells fargo bank accounts  as compared to million at december  working capital was million as of december   as compared to million at december  we may generate additional capital to fund increases in capital expenditures through any of i the sale of some oil and gas lease interests  ii additional sales of our securities  and iii debt financing 
we may not be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
our ability to grow our oil and natural gas reserves and cash flow would be severely impacted if we are unable to obtain equity or debt financing as we may not be able to continue to drill all or some of our projects 
at december   we had  par value  fair value in short term investments in auction rate preferred stocks arps issued by eight taxable us closed end funds 
these arps pay dividends every or days at variable rates that approximate of day us libor rates 
arps normally provide liquidity via an auction process occurring every days or every days  at which time the dividend rate is reset 
arps auctions and similar auctions have had insufficient bids to buy the arps from those wishing to sell  whereby starting in mid february and for the foreseeable future holders of arps have been unable to sell arps in the auction process 
since the auction failures  arps are liquidated by either a redemption at par value at the option of the issuing fund  b purchase at par value by a bank or broker who marketed the arps  usually in a settlement with government agencies  or c sale in a secondary market at a discount to par value 
since december   through march   closed end funds have redeemed at par value or announced redemptions approximating  of our arps 
we hold another  of arps in calamos closed end funds that received on february  an sec exemption allowing the funds to use debt to redeem their remaining arps 
however  the calamos funds have not yet announced such redemptions and might not do so in we anticipate liquidating all of our auction rate preferred shares in  with some shares redeemed by their issuers and other shares sold in private sales at a loss approximating the recognized impairment of  
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities cash flows provided used by operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the additional million in cash outflow in compared with is due in part to a million decline in cash from investment income net of interest expense as we reduced our short term investments in by million to provide funds for capital expenditures 
in both and  cash spent for lease operating expenses and for general and administrative expenses exceeded cash from oil and gas revenues by approximately million 
the million decrease in operating cash flow in compared with is primarily due to a million decline in oil and gas revenue receipts largely arising from the march  sale of our big sky project 
cash basis general and administrative payments increased by million in compared with investment income increased million in compared with from short term investment of cash proceeds from the sale of our big sky project 
net cash used in investing activities in  investing activities provided million in cash 
in september and october   we sold small portions of our acreage holdings for a total of million in cash  we received million in sales and redemptions of short term investments and we spent million investing in oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development 
note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k provides further information on changes in capitalized costs by project 
in late  we spent million on well pipe and tubing expected to be used in completing wells in our net cash used in investing activities for was million 
in we invested million in short term investments and sold in million of those investments to fund in a substantial portion of our capital expenditures 
our oil and natural gas operations are capital intensive  and we invest a substantial portion of our available capital in the acquisition  exploration and development of our oil and gas properties 
we used during million of cash for capital expenditures relating to our oil and natural gas operations 
we received in approximately million in cash relating to a sale of oil and gas assets 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to our share of the drilling and completion of several wells million for completing five wells drilled in  million for three wells drilled and substantially completed in  million for two shallow dry holes in and million for five wells begun in and to be completed in in  rta paid of the costs of four new wells in which we retained working interests equivalent to net wells 
other spending included million primarily attributable to acquisitions of additional leases 
during  we participated in the drilling of a total of twelve gross net wells 
of these wells  four gross net were productive wells and six gross net are not yet completed for production testing 
the other two gross net wells drilled in were shallow dry holes that extended lease lives 
during the year ended december   we used million relating to our oil and natural gas operations  and we used  primarily for the acquisition of furniture and equipment relating to our office move 
we offset these amounts by selling oil and gas assets for approximately million  leaving our net capital used in investing activities for at  capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of twelve gross wells  ten of which were successful 
other spending included million primarily attributable to land holdings and capitalized g a 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended  cash flows from financing activities were million borrowed in march  repaid within three months and million borrowed in september and repaid within two months 
we borrowed these funds from our broker when the broker was unable to liquidate our short term investments in arps at par value 

table of contents cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended december  came primarily from net proceeds from the sale of common stock of million with an additional million received from the exercise of warrants and options 
for the year ended december  cash flows provided by financing activities of  came from the exercise of warrants and options 
contractual obligations as of december  in addition to the  of current liabilities incurred as of december  as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet of that date  we have the following contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payment due by period total after long term debt capital lease obligations lease of office space asset retirement obligations a development of proved reserves b   other well drilling completion b   equipment inventory orders b   total a the asset retirement obligations liability of  at december  is a discounted present value of estimated future retirement obligations  excluding cost reductions for the salvaging of equipment when wells are retired 
the estimated asset retirement obligations  net of associated estimated equipment salvage value  in total and by future periods is zero 
our estimated total asset retirement obligations  without reduction for equipment salvage value  is approximately  at current prices 
the timing of the  is in   in the three year period through   in the two year period to and  after in many cases  timing will change as factors such as future changes in oil and gas prices change the economic lives of our wells 
b these three categories show estimates of the costs of obligations at december  to participate in completion of wells with proved reserves  the drilling or completion of other wells in progress at december  and one well to be drilled in and the purchase of well casing and tubing to have on hand for use in some of the other wells planned to be drilled in critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america 
such accounting principles allow in some cases for the adoption of accounting policies that are not uniformly followed by all companies in a given industry 
for example  we have adopted the full cost accounting method for oil and gas exploration and production activities 
many of our competitors use the full cost accounting method while other competitors use the successful efforts method 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of our consolidated financial statements contained herein 
financial statement preparation also involves the use of estimates  such as the estimation of proved oil and gas reserves 
we believe the following to be the most critical of our significant accounting policies and our estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
full cost accounting method we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration  development and estimated abandonment costs  including certain related employee costs and general and administrative costs less any reimbursements for such costs  incurred for the purpose of acquiring and finding oil and gas are capitalized 
unevaluated property costs are excluded from the amortization base until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves on the respective property or impairment 
we review our unevaluated properties at the end of each quarter to determine whether the costs should be reclassified to the full cost pool and thereby subject to amortization 
sales of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to the net full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized  unless the adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 

table of contents capitalized costs of oil and gas properties evaluated as having  or not having  proved reserves are amortized in the aggregate by country using the unit of production method based upon estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
the costs of properties not yet evaluated are not amortized until evaluation of the property 
for amortization purposes  relative volumes of oil and gas production and reserves are converted at the energy equivalent conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil 
amortizable costs include estimates of future development costs of proved undeveloped reserves 
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties net of related deferred income taxes may not exceed a ceiling amount equal to the present value  discounted at per annum  of the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves plus the cost of unevaluated properties adjusted for related income tax effects 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment expense  net of its related reduction of the deferred income tax provision 
the present value of estimated future net cash flows is computed by applying period end oil and gas prices of oil and natural gas to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of period end  less estimated future expenditures at period end rates to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves and assuming continuation of economic conditions existing at period end 
sec guidance allows the ceiling to be increased for subsequent events occurring reasonably before the filing date of the affected financial statements and indicative that capitalized costs were not impaired at period end 
such subsequent events are increased oil and gas prices and the proving up of additional reserves on properties owned at period end 
the present value of proved reserves future net cash flows excludes future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet following sec staff accounting bulletin no 

estimates of proved oil and gas reserves estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves have significant impact on the carrying value of our oil and gas properties  the related property amortization expense and related property impairment expense 
volumes of reserves actually recovered and cash flows actually received from actual production may differ significantly from the proved reserve estimates and the related projected cash flows  respectively 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact way 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment and the existence of development plans 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimates 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
estimates of fair values of unevaluated and evaluated properties company management estimates the fair values of unevaluated properties  by project  as one key consideration in the quarterly management assessment of whether capitalized costs of unevaluated properties are impaired 
company management also must estimate the fair value of oil and gas properties when we sell properties and the gain on sale must be determined under the full cost accounting method by allocating to the sale a portion of the total capitalized cost of the us cost center on the basis of the fair value of the properties sold and the fair values of all properties owned evaluated and unevaluated immediately prior to the sale 
company management routinely estimates fair value of properties in the course of negotiating the acquisition or disposition of properties and participation agreements with third parties to pay for a disproportionate share of well costs to earn a portion of lease rights 
estimation of fair values of oil and gas properties  particularly an aggregation or project of unevaluated properties  can be difficult and is often based on assumptions that must be subjectively determined and will change with various factors including i the passage of time  ii changes in oil and gas prices  iii drilling results  iv changes in drilling cost rates and v estimated probability of exploration success 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred income taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when assets are recovered or settled 
deferred income taxes are also recognized for tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes 
deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax rates to the differences between financial statement and income tax reporting 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
asset retirement obligation our accounting for asset retirement obligations is governed by sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement requires us to record our estimate of the fair value of liabilities related to future asset retirement obligations in the period the obligation is incurred 
asset retirement obligations relate to the removal of facilities and tangible equipment at the end of an oil and gas property s useful life 
the adoption of sfas no 
requires the use of management s estimates with respect to future abandonment costs  inflation  market risk premiums  useful life and cost of capital 
as required by sfas no 
 our estimate of our asset retirement obligations does not give consideration to the value the related assets could have to other parties 
natural gas imbalances we may have an interest with other producers in certain properties  in which case we use the sales method to account for natural gas imbalances 
under this method  revenue is recorded on the basis of natural gas we actually sell 
in addition  we may record revenue for our share of natural gas sold by other owners that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves 
we also reduce revenue for other owners natural gas we sell that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves 
our remaining over and under produced gas balancing positions are considered in our proved reserves 
as of december  and  our produced natural gas volumes were in balance 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp and fsp  which amend sfas fsp amends sfas to exclude certain lease transactions accounted for under other accounting pronouncements 
fsp delays the effective date of sfas for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we adopted sfas effective january  except the effective date is january  for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities as provided in fsp management does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
applies to all entities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we elected not to adopt the fair value option for assets and liabilities held on the january  effective date 
in december the fasb issued sfas  non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb  which establishes accounting and reporting standards with regards to non controlling interests  previously known as minority interests 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
on january   but we have no non controlling interests 
we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents in december the fasb issued sfas revised  business combinations  which significantly changes the financial accounting and reporting of many business combination transactions  with an emphasis on valuing at fair value as of the acquisition date the related acquired assets and liabilities and any non controlling interests of the acquired business 
we are required to adopt sfas r on january   and it would apply prospectively  ie  to any acquisitions we make on or after that date 
the adoption s impact on our consolidated financial statements will be largely dependent on the nature of any business combinations completed after the adoption 
in march the fasb issued sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which requires disclosures of objectives for using derivative instruments 
the statement is effective for us beginning january   but we do not expect sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
on december   the sec published changes to its rules and interpretations with regards to disclosures by oil and gas exploration companies  effective for annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after december  early adoption is not permitted 
key changes include changes to the oil and gas prices used to estimate proved reserves  permitting the disclosure of probable and possible reserves and the use of new technology for determining reserve classification 
we are currently assessing the impact that the adoption will have on our disclosures  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the company s oil and gas business makes it vulnerable to changes in wellhead prices of crude oil and natural gas 
such prices have been volatile in the past and can be expected to be volatile in the future 
by definition  proved reserves are based on current oil and gas prices 
declines in oil and gas prices reduce the estimated quantity of proved reserves and increase annual amortization expense which is based on proved reserves 
declines in oil and gas prices can reduce the value of our oil and gas properties and increase impairment expense  as occurred in in  oil and gas prices were generally more volatile than in and average oil prices per barrel for our proved reserves approximated at december   at june   at september  and at december  proved reserve average natural gas prices per mcf as of the same dates were approximately   and  respectively 
if december  oil and gas prices had been double their actual prices  the million loss for would likely have been approximately million due simply to the higher year end oil and gas prices eliminating the need for the million ceiling impairment for the fourth quarter of and likely eliminating the million goodwill impairment 
we expect oil and gas price volatility to continue 
we do not currently utilize hedging contracts to protect against commodity price risk 
as our oil and gas production grows  we may manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price declines by entering into oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements to secure a price for a portion of our expected future oil and natural gas production 

table of contents operating cost risk during and  we have generally experienced rising operating costs including drilling costs which impacts our cash flow from operating activities and profitability 
with the decline in oil and gas prices in recent months  we have seen a reduction in drilling activity in the rocky mountain region where our properties are located  and we are beginning to see significant decreases in drilling costs  but little or no reduction in oil and gas production costs other than production taxes which are generally levied as a percentage of revenue 
if oil and gas prices were to recover to levels seen in december  we anticipate the reductions in drilling activity and drilling cost rates will substantially reverse and may fully reverse and continue to rise 
in the case of our fetter property  where the latest vertical well cost less than half and has substantially more reserves than a vertical fetter well drilled earlier in  the substantial economic improvements are due to drilling and completing the wells differently and not to reductions in rates charged by subcontractors for the use of their drilling rigs and services 
we expect to see improvements due to rate reductions in fetter wells drilled in decreases in drilling costs and production costs can have a significant impact on our profitability and may be deciding factors on how many wells we will drill in a given project 
interest rate risk at december   we had no interest bearing debt or credit facilities 
short term interest rates on our million of cash equivalent investments were less than per annum at december  short term dividend rates on our  in auction rate preferred shares approximated per annum and are at rates approximating of day us libor rates 
an increase in short term interest rates would be favorable to us  increasing our investment income in proportion to our short term investments and cash equivalent investments
