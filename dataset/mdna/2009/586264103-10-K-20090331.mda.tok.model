item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide advanced semiconductor sensor and system solutions based on integrated mems technology and mixed signal circuit design 
our accelerometer products are used to measure tilt  shock  vibration and acceleration  and have a wide range of applications such as mobile phones  automotive safety systems and video projectors 
we combine proprietary thermal based mems technology and advanced analog mixed signal processing circuitry design into a single chip using a standard cmos process 
this approach allows us to provide sensor solutions at a lower cost  with higher performance and greater functionality than our competitors 
in addition  our technology platform allows us to easily integrate additional functions or create new sensors to expand into magnetic  touch and flow sensors and related applications 
although we have experienced significant growth since our products were first commercialized in  our growth has slowed recently 
the recent increases in our unit sales volume and sales revenue were primarily attributable to increases in the sale of our products for mobile phone applications and automotive applications 
in  however  our net sales and gross margins have been adversely affected by a number of factors  including a slowdown in the mobile handset market in china  the may earthquake in china  and generally weak global economic conditions 
the us and other global economies are currently experiencing a recession that has affected all sectors of the economy and that has continued to deepen  resulting in declines in economic growth and consumer confidence  increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability 
global credit and financial markets have also experiencing extreme disruptions  including diminished liquidity and credit availability and rapid fluctuations in market valuations 
our business has been affected by these conditions and is likely to be affected by them in the future  and there is no certainty that economic conditions will not deteriorate further 
these uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways  making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities 
deteriorating economic conditions may lead consumers and businesses to continue to postpone spending  which may cause our customers to cancel  decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us 
in addition  the inability of customers to obtain credit could negatively affect our revenues and our ability to collect receivables 
in addition  financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays  increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges 
we expect that sales of our accelerometer products to continue to represent a predominant share of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
we expect that sales of our first non accelerometer products  including magnetic sensors and gas flow sensors  will begin to increase in the second half of we sell our products either to distributors  which then resell to oems and odms  or to oem and odm customers directly 
historically  a small number of our customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue  and sales to our largest distributor customers and oem and odm customers have varied significantly 
this significant variation is in part due to the fact that our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term contracts 
although our distributors generally provide us with non binding rolling forecasts  our distributors generally have up to days prior to delivery to cancel or reschedule shipments pursuant to our distribution agreements 
this arrangement has added to the fluctuation and unpredictability of our sales 
because our products are a component of our customers products  our sales performance is significantly affected by the sales performance of our customers products 
it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our product demand because in the case where we sell our products to distributors  we may not know the identity of the distributor s oem and odm customers and information regarding their demand 
oem and odm customers products are complex and require significant time to define  design and ramp to volume production 
our sales cycle begins with our marketing and sales staff and application engineers engaging with our oem and odm customers system designers and management  which is typically a multi month  or even multi year  process 
if such process is successful  an oem and odm customer will decide to incorporate our solution in its product  which we refer to as a design win 
because the sales cycles for our products are long  
table of contents we incur expenses to develop and sell our products  regardless of whether we achieve the design win and well in advance of generating revenue  if any  from those expenditures 
although we do not have long term purchase commitments from any of our distributor customers or oem and odm customers  once one of our products is incorporated into an oem s or odm s design  it is likely to remain a part of the design for the life cycle of its product 
we believe this to be the case because a redesign would generally be time consuming and expensive 
we have experienced revenue growth due to an increase in the number of our products offered  an expansion of our customer base  an increase in the number of design wins within any one oem and odm customer and an increase in the average revenue per design win 
we manufacture our products utilizing a semi fabless model by outsourcing the production of cmos wafers and completing the post cmos mems process in house 
by outsourcing the standard cmos manufacturing process  we are able to more efficiently manage our capital expenditures and cost of goods sold 
description of certain line items net sales net sales represent gross revenue net of an allowance for the estimated amount of product returns and sales rebates from our customers 
sales to distributors are made pursuant to distributor agreements  which allow for the return of goods under certain circumstances 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas prior to august   we deferred recognition of sales to a major distributor  world peace industrial co  ltd  or wpi  which did not meet the criteria of sfas  until the product was sold through to wpi s oem and odm customers 
on august   we amended the distributor agreement with wpi to allow returns only upon our approval 
accordingly  the criteria under sfas no 
have been met for this distributor as of august   and we have recognized revenue upon shipment to wpi for all shipments subsequent to this date 
for all shipments to wpi made prior to august   we continued to recognize our revenue upon shipments to its oem and odm customers 
historically  our revenue has been derived primarily from shipments of our accelerometer products 
the primary factors that affect our revenue are the sales volumes and average selling prices of our products 
prior to  the significant increases in our net sales have been primarily attributable to the increases in the sales volumes of our products  particularly those for mobile phone and automotive applications 
the average selling prices of our products generally decline over time and are primarily affected by a combination of the following factors the semiconductor market is highly competitive  and as a result  the average selling prices of particular products generally experience rapid declines over the course of their respective product and technology life cycles 
we seek to mitigate the impact of this trend on our business by continuing to rapidly design  develop and sell new generations of products with additional functionalities to replace older generation products  we may also reduce our product prices as we are able to increase our production yields or to reduce our manufacturing costs  particularly the wafer prices  changes in our product mix may affect the average selling prices of our products 
historically  for example  our revenue derived from consumer and mobile phone markets  as a percentage of our total revenue  has increased 
our products for these markets generally have lower average selling prices than products for the automotive market 
the average selling prices of products may continue to be affected by our strategy to increase market adoption of our products in certain markets  and we occasionally grant discounts to our largest customers or oem and odm customers for high volume purchases 
net sales by application in  net sales from mobile phone applications were the largest component of our total sales  representing of total net sales 
although our reliance on sales from mobile phone applications decreased in 
table of contents  we expect that net sales from mobile phone applications will continue to be the largest component of our total sales in we attribute much of the decrease in net sales from mobile phone applications in to a general slowdown of the mobile phone market in china and the weak global economy in general 
net sales from automotive applications  in absolute terms  have increased in  primarily due to increases in sales of rollover application products to autoliv inc to increase net sales from the automotive market  we are currently seeking to increase sales from other automotive applications and to expand our customer base 
however  revenue increases  if any  from the automotive market will require significant time  as the development lead time in this market is generally longer than other markets to date  and this market has been disproportionately affected by the current global downturn 
net sales from consumer applications have fluctuated historically as a result of the generally short life cycle of consumer electronics and changes in our customer base 
as our product offering and customer base for consumer applications continue to diversify  we expect net sales from consumer applications to fluctuate less 
net sales from industrial and other markets have been limited  and we do not expect revenue from these markets to contribute significantly to our total revenue in the following table sets forth our net sales by application for the periods indicated by amount and as a percentage of our net sales dollar amounts in thousands 
for the year ended december  application amount of net sales amount of net sales mobile phone consumer automotive industrial other total net sales by customer base our customers primarily consist of distributors  oems and odms 
historically  a small number of our customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our net sales 
we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future 
our customers representing or more of our net sales accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net sales in and we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in demand from a significant number of customers  including many of our largest customers 
it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our product demand  particularly in the case of sales to our distributors  as we may not know the identity of the distributor s oem and odm customers and lack information regarding their demand 
occasionally  design changes in the products of our oem and odm customers have resulted in the loss of sales 
for example  a design change in a product of a large oem customer in for mobile phone applications resulted in a decrease of our sales to such customer in that customer accounted for of our net sales in net sales by geography our products are shipped to oem and odm customers worldwide 
however  we focus on different application markets among geographical regions 
in the greater china region  our revenue has historically been 
table of contents primarily derived from products for mobile phone applications 
we are also seeking to expand the consumer and industrial applications markets in the greater china region 
in japan  our revenue has primarily been derived from products for consumer applications  particularly projectors 
we are also seeking to penetrate the automotive market in japan 
in north america  our revenue has primarily been derived from products for automotive applications 
in europe  our revenue has fluctuated 
in  we experienced a revenue increase from products for automotive applications in europe 
the following table sets forth our net sales by geographical region for the periods indicated by amount and as a percentage of our net sales dollar amounts in thousands 
for the year ended december  amount of net sales amount of net sales asia excluding japan europe japan north america other total net sales cost of goods sold we are a semi fabless company 
we outsource wafer production to third party foundries and complete the post cmos mems and most of the packaging  assembly and testing functions in house 
we also purchase our ceramic packaging materials from third party suppliers 
cost of goods sold consists of i cost of wafer  ceramic and other materials purchased from third parties  ii manufacturing overhead  primarily consisting of salaries and wages of our quality control employees and manufacturing related management employees  depreciation  and equipment and parts  iii direct labor  primarily consisting of salaries and wages of our manufacturing operators  and iv outsourced processing fees paid to third party packaging service providers 
our relationships with third party foundry and packaging service providers do not provide for guaranteed levels of production capacity at pre determined prices 
as a result  our outsourcing costs relating to wafer production  and to a lesser extent  packaging services  are susceptible to changes based on conditions in the global semiconductor market and our service providers available capacity 
prior to august  we deferred recognition of cost of goods sold for a major distributor  wpi  which did not meet the criteria of sfas  until the product was sold through to wpi s oem and odm customers 
wpi accounted for of our revenue in  of our revenue in and of our revenue in on august   we amended the distributor agreement with wpi to allow for returns only upon our approval 
accordingly  the criteria under sfas no 
have been met for this distributor as of august   and subsequent to that date we have recognized the cost of goods sold as the related products are sold 
for all shipments to wpi made prior to august   we continued to recognize costs related to products once sold by wpi to its oem and odm customers 
gross profit and gross margin until recently  our gross profit generally experienced growth in line with increases in our revenue 
however  more recently  our gross margin has been decreasing from in  to in and in our gross profit and gross margin are affected by a variety of factors  including average selling prices of our products  our product application mix  prices of wafers  excess and obsolete inventory  pricing by competitors  changes in production yields  and percentage of sales conducted through distributors 
our products for mobile 
table of contents phone applications  which are sold to distributor customers  have historically had lower margins than our products for automotive products  which are sold directly to our oem and odm customers  and this trend has accelerated recently 
the increase in the percentage of our net sales in products for mobile phone applications in recent years has therefore had an adverse effect on our overall gross margin 
notwithstanding the relatively lower margin in the mobile phone applications market  we expect to derive an increasing percentage of our total net sales from that market because of the significant potential for further revenue growth from increased penetration in that market 
our gross margin in was adversely affected by the costs related to the olympic torch project for which during the second quarter  we had to reverse revenue that was previously recognized in the first quarter 
excluding the impact of the torch project  our gross margin in would be 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are recognized as they are incurred and primarily consist of salaries and wages of research and development employees  research costs  primarily consisting of mask costs and prototype wafers  consulting fees paid for outside design services  travel and other expenses  and beginning in  stock based compensation under sfas r attributable to our research and development employees 
historically  research and development expenses have increased both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net sales 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future as we seek to diversify into non accelerometer products and hire additional employees in connection with the new research and development institute that we established in the second quarter of general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and wages for administrative personnel  costs for professional services  including legal  tax and accounting services  depreciation and amortization expenses for non manufacturing equipment  travel and entertainment expenses  office supply and other office related expenses  office rental expenses  others  such as utilities  insurance and provision for accounts receivable  and stock based compensation under sfas r 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we hire additional personnel and incur costs related to the anticipated growth of our business and our operations as a public company upon the completion of this offering 
however  we expect that such expenses will decrease as a percentage of net sales 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of wages  salaries and commissions for our sales and marketing personnel  consulting expenses  primarily consisting of sales consulting services and software application consulting services  travel expenses  independent sales representatives commissions  office rental  market promotion and others expenses and stock based compensation under sfas r we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel  expand our sales and marketing network and engage in additional marketing and promotional activities 
however  we expect that such expenses will decrease as a percentage of net sales 
other income expense other income expense  primarily consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents  and interest expense incurred on our borrowings and net foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
provision benefit for income taxes we conduct sales through our headquarters in andover  massachusetts 
our wuxi subsidiary is primarily engaged in manufacturing and engineering activities and does not conduct direct sales to customers 
for internal 
table of contents accounting and prc tax purposes  we account for the transfers of goods from our wuxi subsidiary to our us headquarters as sales  and calculate the transfer price of such sales based on a markup of manufacturing and operating costs 
we believe the prices of these sales were consistent with the prevailing market prices 
us tax in the united states  we are subject to the federal income tax and the massachusetts state income tax  which are approximately at the rates of and  respectively 
at december   the company had gross us net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire in the year included within this amount is approximately  of excess tax deductions associated with non qualified stock options that have been exercised 
when these excess tax benefits actually result in a reduction to currently payable income taxes  the tax benefit will be recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
the company s operating losses may be subject to limitations under provisions of the internal revenue code 
prc tax our prc taxes primarily consist of enterprise income tax  value added tax  and certain other miscellaneous taxes 
as of december   our wuxi subsidiary had no prc nol carryforwards available to offset future prc enterprise income tax and entered into the second year of the two year tax exemption period 
in  we recorded deferred tax assets in china as a result of temporary differences between the pre tax income and taxable income for our memsic semiconductor since we ended the last year of the two year tax exemption period in and will enter into a three year period at reduced income tax rate beginning in enterprise income tax prc enterprise income tax is calculated based on taxable income determined under prc accounting principles 
in accordance with income tax of china for enterprises with foreign investment and foreign enterprises  or the foreign enterprise income tax law  and the related implementing rules  foreign investment enterprises  or fies  incorporated in the prc are generally subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 
the foreign enterprise income tax law and the related implementing rules provide certain favorable tax treatments to fies which qualify as high technology companies and are registered and operate in designated high technology zones in the prc 
our wuxi subsidiary is a high technology fie registered and operating in a designated high technology zone 
accordingly  under the foreign enterprise income tax law  its implementing rules and several local regulations  our wuxi subsidiary is entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 
in addition  our wuxi subsidiary is entitled to a five year tax holiday  pursuant to which it is exempted from paying the enterprise income tax for  the year in which it first had positive accumulated earnings  and after the two year exemption period  our wuxi subsidiary will be entitled to a reduction from the then applicable income tax rate for each year from through after the expiration of this five year tax holiday period  a preferential enterprise income tax rate of may apply for so long as our wuxi subsidiary continues to be recognized as a high technology company especially supported by the prc government 
to qualify as a high technology company especially supported by the prc government for prc enterprise income tax purposes  a business entity generally must meet certain financial and non financial criteria  including  but not limited to products or services of the business falling under the scope of high technology especially supported by the prc government  a minimum level of revenue generated from high technology related sales or services as a percentage of total revenue  a minimum number of employees engaged in research and development as a percentage of total number of employees  and 
table of contents a minimum level of research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue 
if the prc central government or applicable local governments determine that our wuxi subsidiary is not or no longer qualifies as a high technology company especially supported by the prc government  our effective enterprise income tax rate would increase as a result 
in addition  as an fie  our wuxi subsidiary enjoys certain tax deductions for purchasing equipment made in china 
under the relevant regulation  if an fie purchases chinese made equipment  and the price does not exceed the total investment amount of the fie  for projects that fall within certain specified categories  of the purchase price amount may be credited against the surplus between the amount of enterprise income tax payable in the current year and the amount paid in the previous year 
if the credited amount is greater than the surplus  the excess amount can be carried forward for up to five years  subject to certain exceptions 
if our wuxi subsidiary ceases to qualify for its current preferential enterprise income tax rates  we will consider options that may be available at the time that would enable it to qualify for other preferential tax treatment 
to the extent we are unable to offset the expiration of  or the inability to obtain  preferential tax treatment with new tax exemptions  tax incentives or other tax benefits  our effective tax rate will increase 
the amount of income tax payable by our wuxi subsidiary in the future will depend on various factors  including  among other things  the results of operations and taxable income of our wuxi subsidiary which is in turn partially dependent on our internal transfer pricing policies and the applicable statutory tax rate 
on march   the national people s congress approved and promulgated a new tax law named enterprise income tax law  which took effect beginning january  under the new tax law  fies and domestic companies are subject to a uniform tax rate of 
the new tax law provides a five year transition period starting from its effective date for those enterprises which were established before the promulgation date of the new tax law and which were entitled to a preferential lower tax rate under the then effective tax laws or regulations 
in accordance with regulations issued by the state council  the tax rate of such enterprises may gradually transition to the uniform tax rate within the transition period 
for those enterprises which are enjoying tax holidays  such tax holidays may continue until their expiration in accordance with the regulations issued by the state council 
while the new tax law equalizes the tax rates for fies and domestic companies  preferential tax treatment would continue to be given to companies in certain encouraged sectors and to entities classified as high technology companies especially supported by the prc government  whether fies or domestic companies 
our wuxi subsidiary has been qualified as a high technology company especially supported by the prc government 
therefore  a preferential enterprise income tax rate of under the new tax law may apply to our wuxi subsidiary 
however  according to the relevant transition preferential tax policies issued by the state council  the preferential enterprise income tax rate under the new tax law and the transition period preferential tax policy cannot apply simultaneously 
that is to say  our wuxi subsidiary may either choose to enjoy the exemption from enterprise income tax for and and a reduction on the uniform enterprise income tax rate of from to  or  choose the preferential enterprise income tax rate of for qualified high technology companies under the new tax law 
we believe the adoption of the transition period preferential tax policy will be more beneficial to our wuxi subsidiary 
therefore  from to  the effective income tax rate for our wuxi subsidiary will be 
as a result of the new tax law  following the year  upon expiration of our reduction from the then applicable income tax rate  our effective tax rate may increase  unless we are otherwise eligible for preferential treatment 
see risk factors risks related to doing business in china the discontinuation of any of the preferential tax treatments currently available to us in china could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents other prc taxes other miscellaneous prc taxes primarily consist of property tax  land use tax and stamp tax which are accounted for in our general and administrative expenses  and education surcharge  which is recorded as part of our cost of goods sold 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and are those that require the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures filed in with this prospectus 
investments we account for our investments under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are accounted for at their fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these securities are reported as other comprehensive income loss  respectively 
under sfas  unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported net of the related tax effect in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
when the fair value of an investment declines below its original cost  we evaluate the investment in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb staff positions and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its applications to certain investments  which address the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
when the fair value of an investment declines below its original cost  we consider all available evidence to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary 
among other things  we consider the duration and extent of the decline and economic factors influencing the markets 
if a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written off to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down is reflected in earnings that is  accounted for as a realized loss 
the new cost basis is not to be changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
subsequent increases in the fair value of available for sale securities are included in other comprehensive income  subsequent decreases in fair value  if not an other than temporary impairment  also are included in other comprehensive income 
the determination of whether a loss is other than temporary is highly judgmental and may have a material impact on our results of operations 
as of december   our investments included million of auction rate securities 
due to liquidity issues that have recently been experienced in global credit and capital markets  certain of the auction rate securities we hold have failed at auction  meaning that the amount of securities submitted for sale at auction exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
if an auction fails  the issuer becomes obligated to pay interest at 
table of contents penalty rates  and all of the auction rate securities we hold continue to pay interest in accordance with their stated terms 
we have classified our auction rate securities as long term investments at december   due to our assessment of the uncertainty as to the time frame within which we would likely be able to liquidate these investments under current market conditions 
we estimated the fair value of these securities at december  using broker valuations and internally developed models of the expected future cash flows related to the securities 
one of the more significant assumptions made in our internally developed models was the term of expected cash flows of the underlying auction rate securities 
we developed several scenarios for the liquidation of the auction rate securities over periods that ranged from to years 
based on our internal modeling and the value provided by the broker  we concluded that our auction rate securities had incurred a temporary unrealized impairment loss in the amount of  as of december   and we reduced the carrying amount of these investments by this amount to be million 
in estimating the fair value of these investments  we considered the financial condition and near term prospect of the issuers  the magnitude of the losses compared to the investments cost  the length of time the investments have been in an unrealized loss position  the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security  whether the security has been downgraded by a rating agency  and our ability and intent to hold these investments until the anticipated recovery in market value occurs 
this unrealized loss has been recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying financial statements 
we intend to hold these auction rate securities for the foreseeable future  if necessary 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products to oem and odm customers when all of the following conditions have been met i evidence exists of an arrangement with the customer  typically consisting of a purchase order or contract  ii our products have been shipped and risk of loss has passed to the customer  iii we have completed all of the necessary terms of the purchase order or contract  iv the amount of revenue to which we are entitled is fixed or determinable  and v we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect the amount due from the customer 
to the extent that one or more of these conditions has not been satisfied  we defer recognition of revenue 
an allowance for estimated future product returns and sales price allowances is established at the date of revenue recognition 
an allowance for uncollectible receivables is established by a charge to operations  when in our opinion  it is probable that the amount due to us will not be collected 
historically  product returns and bad debt expense have not been significant 
our products are warranted against manufacturing defects for twelve months following the date of sale eighteen months following date of sale to a distributor 
products returned under the provisions of the warranty agreement require our pre approval 
our sole obligation under the provisions of the warranty agreement is to replace or repair the product 
reserves for potential warranty claims are provided at the time of revenue recognition and are based on several factors including historical claims experience  current sales levels and our estimate of repair costs 
to date  warranty expenses have not been significant 
sales to distributors are made pursuant to distributor agreements  which allow for the return of goods under certain circumstances 
we follow the provision of sfas no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists 
sfas no 
includes the following criteria for recognition of sales to distributors i the selling price to the distributors is fixed or determinable at the date of shipment  ii our product has been shipped and risk of loss has passed to the distributors  iv it is probable that the amount due from the distributor will be collected  v we do not have a significant future obligations to directly assist in the distributor s resale of the product and vi the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
once these criteria are met  we recognize revenue upon shipment to the distributor and estimate returns based on historical sales returns 
wpi was a significant distributor which accounted for of our net sales in and of our net sales in the criteria under sfas no 
were not met for wpi for the periods prior to august  based on the early stage of our relationship with wpi and its size  we were unable to make a reasonable estimate 
table of contents of future returns 
therefore  we deferred recognition of revenue and related costs of good sold associated with wpi until the relevant products were shipped by wpi to its oem and odm customers for those periods 
on august   we amended the distributor agreement with wpi to allow for returns only upon our approval 
accordingly  the criteria under sfas no 
have been met for this distributor as of august   and we have recognized revenue and related costs upon shipment to this distributor for all shipments subsequent to this date 
for all shipments to wpi made prior to august   we continued to recognize our revenue and related costs upon shipments to its oem and odm customers 
allowance for doubtful accounts the following table sets forth activities in our allowance for doubtful accounts for the periods indicated for the year ended december  balance at beginning of period provision for losses receivables charged against reserve balance at end of period our standard policy on payment terms is net days from delivery 
in and  our average days sales outstanding was days and days  respectively 
at certain times our trade accounts receivable have included balances from customers that have exceeded of total accounts receivable 
we have established credit limits for each of our customers and reviewed such limits prior to product shipment 
we believe that such customers are of high credit quality and that we are not subject to unusual risk with respect to such customers 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is included as a charge to sales and marketing expense 
we evaluate the sufficiency of our allowance for accounts receivable on a quarterly basis 
the sufficiency of our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is evaluated based on the recoverability of our accounts receivable  which is in turn based on a combination of factors  many of which are based on estimates 
these factors include indicators of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
in addition  we may consider the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost weighted average first in first out or market 
we evaluate our inventory for potential excess and obsolete inventories based on forecasted demands and record a provision for such amounts as necessary 
we recorded a provision of  and in and  respectively 
stock based compensation general statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  or sfas r  share based payment  addresses accounting for stock based compensation arrangements  including stock options and shares issued to directors  officers and employees under various stock based compensation arrangements 
this statement requires that companies use the fair value method  rather than the intrinsic value method  to determine compensation expense for all stock based arrangements 
under the fair value method  stock based compensation expense is determined at the measurement date  which is generally the date of grant  as the aggregate amount by which the 
table of contents estimated future value of the equity security at the expected date of acquisition as computed under a stock valuation model exceeds the exercise price to be paid 
the resulting compensation expense  if any  is recognized for financial reporting over the term of vesting or performance 
this statement was first effective for us on january  as permitted  we have elected to use the prospective application as our transition method  under which sfas r applies to all prospective stock option and share grants of stock based compensation awards and to grants prior to january  that have been modified subsequently 
stock based compensation arrangements with non employees are accounted for utilizing the fair value method or  if a more reliable measurement  the value of the services or consideration received 
the resulting compensation expense  if any  is recognized for financial reporting over the term of performance or vesting 
description of omnibus stock plan on march   our stockholders and board of directors approved the omnibus stock plan  as amended  or stock plan  under which  shares of our common stock was reserved for issuance to directors  officers  employees  and consultants 
options granted under the stock plan may be incentive stock options  nonqualified stock options and or restricted stock 
the stock plan provides that the exercise price of incentive stock options must be at least equal to the market value of our common stock at the date such option is granted 
for incentive stock option grants to an employee who owns more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  the exercise price on the incentive stock option must be of market value at the time of grant 
granted options expire in ten years or less from the date of grant and vest based on the terms of the awards  generally ratably over four years 
prior to our initial public offering in december  there was no public market for our common stock 
accordingly  the board of directors determined the market value of the common stock at the date of grant by considering a number of relevant factors including our operating and financial performance and corporate milestones achieved  the prices at which shares of convertible preferred stock in arm s length transactions were sold  the composition of and changes to the management team  the superior rights and preferences of securities senior to the common stock at the time of each grant and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying stock options 
determination of fair value of common stock the following table sets forth for all stock options we granted during the number of shares subject to the option  the exercise price  the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and the fair value of the option date of award options granted exercise price per share fair value of common stock fair value of option october august july march april january february we granted  common stock options with an exercise price of per share in july and  common stock options with an exercise price of per share in august at the time of the grants  the exercise price was determined by our board of directors with input from management based on the estimated fair value of our common stock 
subsequently  we had retrospective valuation reports prepared by a third party specialist to support the fair value of the options granted and determined the fair value to be for the options granted in july and for the options granted in august 
as a result of the valuation reports  the grants were modified to increase their respective exercise prices to the reported fair values 
at the time of these option grants  the exercise price was determined by the board with input by management based on the various objective and subjective factors mentioned above as well as valuation reports when available 
the intrinsic value per share is being recognized as compensation expense over the applicable vesting period which corresponds to the service period 

table of contents we engaged an independent third party to assist management in preparing retrospective valuation reports to support the fair value of options granted 
we believe that the valuation methodologies used in the retrospective valuations are consistent with the practice aid of the american institute of certified public accountants entitled valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation 
in each retrospective valuation  a weighted average of the guideline public company method  the guideline transaction method and the discounted future cash flow method was used to estimate the enterprise value of the company at the applicable valuation date 
the guideline public company method and the guideline transaction method estimate the fair value of a company by applying to that company market multiples  in this case revenue and or ebitda multiples  of firms in similar lines of business 
the companies used for comparison under the guideline public company method and guideline transaction method were selected based on a number of factors  including but not limited to  the similarity of their industry  business model  financial risk and other factors to those of memsic 
the discounted future cash flow method involves applying appropriate risk adjusted discount rates between to to estimated debt free cash flows  based on forecasted revenues and costs 
the projections used in connection with this valuation were based on our expected operating performance over the forecast period 
there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates  if different discount rates or assumptions had been used  the valuation would have been different 
we allocated value to the common stockholders using the probability weighted expected return method 
under the probability weighted expected return method  the fair value of the common stock is estimated based upon an analysis of future values for us assuming various future outcomes  the timing of which is based on the plans of our board and management 
share value is based on the probability weighted present value of expected future investment returns  considering each of the possible outcomes available as well as the rights of each share class 
four scenarios were considered 
three of the scenarios assume a stockholder exit  either through an initial public offering  or ipo  a sale of memsic to a strategic acquirer  or dissolution of the company at or below liquidation preference 
the fourth scenario assumes operations continue as a private company and no exit transaction occurs 
for the ipo scenario  the estimated future and present values for our common stock were calculated using assumptions including  the expected pre money valuation based on the guideline public company method discussed above  the expected dates of the future expected ipo  and an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
for the sale scenario  the estimated future and present values for our common stock were calculated using assumptions including the expected dates of the future expected sale and an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
for the dissolution scenario  all of the proceeds are distributed to the preferred stockholders 
no proceeds are available for distribution to the common stockholders  and the value of the common stock is zero 
for the private company with no exit scenario  an equal weighting of the guideline public company method and the discounted cash flow method based on present day assumptions was used 
finally  the present value calculated for our common stock under each scenario was probability weighted based on management s estimate of the relative occurrence of each scenario

income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and of tax credits 
deferred tax assets arise when a company s financial statements recognize charges or expenses that  for income tax purposes  will not be allowed as deductions until future periods 
for example  when a corporation incurs an expense in its financial statements  such as restructuring charges  that it is not allowed to deduct on its 
table of contents federal tax return until paid in the future  the future tax benefit of that expense is generally recorded in the income statement as a reduction of income tax expense and in the balance sheet as a deferred tax asset 
the same general treatment applies to the carry forward of unused net operating losses and unused tax credits 
deferred tax assets are often netted with deferred tax liabilities when presented in the balance sheet and are referred to as net deferred tax assets 
we measure our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws we expect to be in effect at the time of their reversal or utilization 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  a net deferred tax asset may be carried on the balance sheet at its full value only if it is more likely than not that the deductions  losses  or credits giving rise to such deferred tax asset will be used in the future 
we periodically evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability using a consistent approach that considers the relative impact of negative and positive evidence  including our historical profitability and projections of future taxable income 
under gaap  we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income or stockholders equity if we determine  based on available evidence at the time the determination is made  that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans and ongoing tax planning strategies 
this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between our projected operating performance  our actual results and other factors 
as of december   we had been in a three year cumulative loss position in the united states for financial statement reporting purposes 
under sfas no 
 this cumulative loss position constitutes significant  objective evidence that we may not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future 
further  economic conditions in our markets deteriorated and pricing pressures increased during the fourth quarter of  resulting in a net loss for the quarter and for the full year 
after considering these factors and the other available evidence  we were unable to conclude that as of december  it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient taxable income in the united states in the foreseeable future to realize our deferred tax assets 
we therefore recorded a non cash charge of million during the fourth quarter to establish a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the united states in the  balance of our net deferred tax asset at december  related to prc taxes applicable to our china subsidiary 
in the event we generate future taxable income in the future  our income tax expense in future periods could be reduced to the extent those deferred tax assets are deemed recoverable 
we reinvest any earnings of our wuxi subsidiary  memsic semiconductor  in its operations 
we have not provided for us income taxes that could result from the distribution of such earnings to us 
if these earnings were ultimately distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise  or if the shares of the wuxi subsidiary were sold or transferred  we would be subject to additional us income taxes  net of impact of any available foreign tax credits 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred us taxes on these undistributed earnings 
on january   we adopted fin at the adoption date  we had no unrecognized tax benefits and determined that the impact of fin was not material to our consolidated financial statements

our net sales decreased by to million in from million in this decrease was due to a decrease in the number of units sold  primarily for mobile phone applications  which was partly offset by an increase in unit sales for automotive applications  and to reductions in the average selling price of our products  particularly in the mobile phone and consumer market in china

research and development 
our research and development expenses increased by approximately  to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to i an increase of million in wages and salaries as a result of an increase in our head count for engineers and other research and development employees in both china and the us ii an increase of million in research costs relating to the development of new products and iii an increase of million in our engineers travel expense 
research and development expenses  as a percentage of total net sales  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due largely to the decreased revenues 
we will continue to invest in research and development projects to develop new products and system solutions  and as a result  we expect our research and development expense will continue to increase in sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to i an increase of million in wages and salaries due to an increase in the number of sales and marketing employees and ii an increase of million in stock based compensation expense  offset by iii a decrease of million consulting fees for third party sales consulting and sales related software application services

provision benefit for income taxes 
our income tax provision was million in compared to an income tax provision of million in our income tax provision in reflected our establishment of a full valuation allowance of million at december  against our us deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding future taxable income in the united states 
our wuxi subsidiary recorded a tax benefit of million related to establishing a deferred tax asset in china 
our wuxi subsidiary will start its three year tax holiday period  at of the unified tax rate of  in liquidity and capital resources as of december   our investments included million of auction rate securities that have failed at auction and that are classified as long term investments on our balance sheet 
the principal represented by these investments will not be accessible to us until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not expect the potential lack of liquidity in these investments to affect our ability to execute our current business plan in the near term 
there can 
table of contents be no assurance that we would be able in the near term to liquidate these securities on favorable terms  or at all  and if we should require access to these funds sooner than we currently expect  our inability to sell these auction rate securities could adversely affect our liquidity and our financial flexibility 
we outsource certain steps of the manufacturing process to third parties while conducting the remaining steps in house 
as a result  our principal uses of cash historically have consisted of both payments to our suppliers for the costs related to the outsourcing of wafer fabrication and outsourced processing fees paid to and materials purchased from third parties  as well as payments for our manufacturing overhead and equipment purchases 
other significant cash outlays primarily consist of salaries  wages and commissions for our non manufacturing related employees 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we believe that our current cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
our future cash requirements will depend on many factors  including our operating income  the timing of our new product introductions  the costs to maintaining adequate manufacturing capacity  the continuing market acceptance of our products  or other changing business conditions and future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if our existing cash is insufficient to meet our requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity securities  debt securities or borrow from banks 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
the sale of additional equity securities  including convertible debt securities  would be dilutive to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would divert cash for working capital requirements and capital expenditures to service debt and could result in operating and financial covenants that restrict our operations and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing  our business  operations and prospects may suffer
