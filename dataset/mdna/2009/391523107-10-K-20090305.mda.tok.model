table of contents industry trends 
we operate in the family entertainment resort segment of the travel and leisure industry 
the concept of a family entertainment resort with an indoor waterpark was first introduced to the united states in wisconsin dells  wisconsin  and has evolved there since in an effort to boost occupancy and daily rates  as well as capture off season demand  hotel operators in the wisconsin dells market began expanding indoor pools and adding waterslides and other water based attractions to existing hotels and resorts 
the success of these efforts prompted several local operators to build new  larger destination resorts based primarily on the concept 
we believe that these properties  which typically are themed and include other resort features such as arcades  retail shops and full food and beverage service in addition to the indoor waterpark  have historically outperformed standard hotels in the market 
we believe that the rate premiums and increased market share in the wisconsin dells for hotels and resorts with some form of an indoor waterpark can be attributed to several factors  including the ability to provide a year round vacation destination without weather related risks  the wide appeal of water based recreation and the favorable trends in leisure travel discussed below 
while no standard industry definition for a family entertainment resort featuring an indoor waterpark has developed  we generally consider resorts with at least rooms featuring indoor waterparks larger than  square feet  as well as a variety of water slides and other water based attractions  to be competitive with our resorts 
a recent hotel leisure advisors  llc h la survey indicates that there are open indoor waterpark resort properties in the united states and canada 
of the total  are considered indoor waterpark destination resorts offering more than  square feet of indoor waterpark space 
of these properties  are great wolf resorts properties 
the same survey indicated openings of indoor waterpark resorts projected for the openings include only two indoor waterpark destination resorts  one of which is our property in concord  north carolina 
we believe recent vacation trends favor drive to family entertainment resorts featuring indoor waterparks  as the number of families choosing to take shorter  more frequent vacations that they can drive to have increased in recent years 
we believe that these trends will continue 
we believe indoor waterpark resorts are generally less affected by changes in economic cycles  as drive to destinations are less expensive and more convenient than destinations that require air travel 
outlook 
we believe that no other operator or developer other than us has established a portfolio of family entertainment resorts featuring indoor waterparks 
we intend to continue to expand our portfolio of owned resorts throughout the united states and to selectively seek licensing and management opportunities domestically and internationally 
the resorts we are currently constructing and plan to develop in the future require significant industry knowledge and substantial capital resources 
similar family entertainment resorts compete directly with several of our resorts 
our primary business objective is to increase long term stockholder value 
we believe we can increase stockholder value by executing our internal and external growth strategies 
our primary internal growth strategies are to maximize total resort revenue  minimize costs by leveraging our economies of scale  and build upon our existing brand awareness and loyalty in order to compete more effectively 
our primary external growth strategies are to capitalize on our first mover advantage by being the first to develop and operate family entertainment resorts featuring indoor waterparks in our selected target markets  focus on development and strategic growth opportunities by seeking to develop additional resorts and target selected licensing and joint venture opportunities  and continue to innovate by leveraging our in house expertise  in conjunction with the knowledge and experience of our third party suppliers and designers 
in attempting to execute our internal and external growth strategies  we are subject to a variety of business challenges and risks 
these challenges include development and licensing of properties  increases in costs of constructing  operating and maintaining our resorts  competition from other entertainment companies  both within and outside our industry segment  and external economic risks  including family vacation patterns and trends 
we seek to meet these challenges by providing sufficient management oversight to site selection  development and resort operations  concentrating on growing and strengthening awareness of our brand and demand for our resorts  and maintaining our focus on safety 

table of contents our business model is highly dependent on consumer spending  and a vacation experience at one of our resorts is a discretionary expenditure for a family 
over the past months  the slowing us economy has led to a decrease in available credit for consumers and a related decrease in consumer discretionary spending 
this trend continued during as consumers experienced several negative economic impacts  including record prices for many commodities  most notably oil  that resulted in increased costs for gasoline and other consumer staples  severe turbulence in the banking and lending sectors  which has led to a general lessening of the availability of credit to consumers  an increased national unemployment rate  a continuing decline in the national average of home prices  and high volatility in the stock market that led to substantial declines in leading market averages and aggregate household savings 
these and other similar factors impact the amount of discretionary income for consumers and consumer sentiment toward discretionary purchases 
as a result  these types of items could negatively impact consumer spending patterns in future periods 
while we believe the convenience  quality and overall affordability of a stay at one of our resorts continues to be an attractive alternative to other potential family vacations  a sustained decrease in overall consumer discretionary spending could have a material  adverse effect on our overall results 
also we believe that our traverse city and sandusky resorts have been and will continue to be affected by especially adverse general economic circumstances in the michigan northern ohio region such as bankruptcies of several major companies and or large announced layoffs by major employers and increased competition that has occurred in these markets over the past three years 
the michigan northern ohio region includes cities that have historically been the traverse city and sandusky resorts largest origin of customers 
we believe the adverse general economic circumstances in the region have negatively impacted overall discretionary consumer spending in that region over the past few years and may continue to do so going forward 
although we have taken steps to reduce our operating costs at these resorts  we believe the general regional economic downturn has and may continue to have an impact on the operating performance of our traverse city and sandusky resorts 
as discussed further below  due to the continued adverse current and expected market conditions for our sandusky resort  in we recorded an  impairment loss related to our interest in the joint venture that owns the wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts 
our wisconsin dells property has been significantly impacted by the abundance of competing indoor waterpark resorts in that market 
the wisconsin dells market has approximately indoor waterpark resorts that compete with us 
we believe this large number of competing properties in a relatively small tourist destination location has and may continue to have an impact on the operating performance of our wisconsin dells resort 
as discussed in critical accounting policies and estimates below  due to the continued adverse current and expected market conditions for our wisconsin dells resort  in we recorded an  impairment loss related to our interest in the joint venture that owns the wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts 
we have experienced a much slower than expected occupancy ramp up and lower than expected average daily room rates at our sheboygan  wisconsin property since its opening in we believe this operating weakness has been primarily attributable to the fact that the overall development of sheboygan as a tourist destination continues to lag materially behind our initial expectations 
we believe this has materially impacted and will likely continue to impact the consumer demand for our indoor waterpark resort in that market and the operations of the resort 
our mason resort opened its first phase in december and is ramping up more slowly than we had projected  which we believe is due  in part  to the opening of competitive properties in the region and to perceived operating issues at the resort in early 
table of contents our external growth strategies are based primarily on developing additional indoor waterpark resorts primarily in conjunction with joint venture partners or by licensing our intellectual property and proprietary systems to others 
developing resorts of the size and scope of our family entertainment resorts generally requires obtaining financing for a significant portion of a project s expected construction costs 
the general tightening in us lending markets has dramatically decreased the overall availability of construction financing 
although the ultimate effect on our external growth strategy of the current credit environment is difficult to predict with certainty  we believe that the availability of construction financing may be lessened in the future and that terms of construction financing may be less favorable than we have seen over the past few years 
we believe we may be able to continue to obtain construction financing sufficient to execute development strategies  however  the more difficult credit market environment is likely to continue at least through  and possibly beyond 
revenue and key performance indicators 
we seek to generate positive cash flows and maximize our return on invested capital from each of our owned resorts 
our rooms revenue represents sales to guests of room nights at our resorts and is the largest contributor to our cash flows and profitability 
rooms revenue accounted for approximately of our total resort revenue for the year ended december  we employ sales and marketing efforts to increase overall demand for rooms at our resorts 
we seek to optimize the relationship between room rates and occupancies through the use of yield management techniques and computer software that attempt to project demand in order to selectively increase room rates during peak demand 
these techniques are designed to assist us in managing our higher occupancy nights to achieve maximum rooms revenue and include such practices as monitoring our historical trends for occupancy and estimating our high occupancy nights  offering the highest discounts to previous guests in off peak periods to build customer loyalty and enhance our ability to charge higher rates in peak periods  structuring rates to allow us to offer our previous guests the best rate while simultaneously working with a promotional partner or offering internet specials  monitoring sales of room types continously to evaluate the effectiveness of offered discounts  and offering specials on standard suites and yielding better rates on larger suites when standard suites sell out 
in addition  we seek to maximize the amount of time and money spent on site by our guests by providing a variety of revenue generating amenities 
we have several key indicators that we use to evaluate the performance of our business 
these indicators include the following occupancy  average daily room rate  or adr  revenue per available room  or revpar  total revenue per available room  or total revpar  total revenue per occupied room  or total revpor  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
occupancy  adr and revpar are commonly used measures within the hospitality industry to evaluate hotel operations and are defined as follows occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms by total available rooms 
adr is calculated by dividing total rooms revenue by total occupied rooms 

table of contents revpar is the product of occupancy and adr 
total revpar and total revpor are defined as follows total revpar is calculated by dividing total revenue by total available rooms 
total revpor is calculated by dividing total revenue by total occupied rooms 
occupancy allows us to measure the general overall demand for rooms at our resorts and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing strategies 
adr allows us to measure the effectiveness of our yield management strategies 
while adr and revpar only include rooms revenue  total revpor and total revpar include both rooms revenue and other revenue derived from food and beverage and other amenities at our resorts 
we consider total revpor and total revpar to be key performance indicators for our business because we derive a significant portion of our revenue from food and beverage and other amenities 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total resort revenues consisted of non rooms revenue 
we use revpar and total revpar to evaluate the blended effect that changes in occupancy  adr and total revpor have on our profitability 
we focus on increasing adr and total revpor because we believe those increases can have the greatest positive impact on our profitability 
in addition  we seek to maximize occupancy  as increases in occupancy generally lead to greater total revenues at our resorts  and we believe maintaining certain occupancy levels is key to covering our fixed costs 
increases in total revenues as a result of higher occupancy are  however  typically accompanied by additional incremental costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs 
in contrast  increases in total revenues from higher adr and total revpor are typically accompanied by lower incremental costs and result  generally  in a greater increase in profitability 
we also use ebitda as a measure of the operating performance of each of our resorts 
ebitda is a supplemental financial measure and is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
see non gaap financial measures below for further discussion of our use of ebitda and a reconciliation to net income 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in the united states 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and our financial reporting process involve the use of accounting estimates based on our current judgments 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from our current judgments 
investments in property and equipment 
we record investments in property and equipment at cost 
improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life  increase capacity or improve the efficiency of the asset 
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years fixtures and equipment  including waterpark equipment years we are required to make subjective assessments as to these useful lives for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation and amortization to record annually with respect to our investments in property and equipment 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in property and equipment we would depreciate and amortize such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation and amortization expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives we have assigned to our depreciable assets to determine whether those useful lives are reasonable and appropriate 

table of contents when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate the carrying values of a long lived asset may be impaired  we perform an analysis to review the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
we make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges from the expected future operations of the asset 
these estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income  operating trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
we had no impairment losses related to long lived assets in any of the periods presented 
carrying values of goodwill  intangible assets and investment in affiliates 
goodwill we are required to assess goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
to test goodwill for impairment  we compare the fair value of the individual resort to which the goodwill is assigned to the carrying value of that resort 
to estimate the resorts fair value we used a discounted cash flow model 
each of our resorts is considered a reporting unit 
if the analysis indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the individual resort  we compare the implied fair value of the resort s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the individual resort to all the assets and liabilities of that resort as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the assessment date 
the excess of the fair value of the individual resort over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
our assessment of the fair value is dependent on the operating results of the resorts 
future adverse changes in the hospitality and lodging industry  market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying real estate assets could result in future losses or the inability to recover the carrying value of goodwill 
we originally recorded on our consolidated balance sheet approximately  of goodwill 
also  in conjunction with our purchase of a minority owner s equity interest in our mason resort  we recorded approximately  of goodwill in in we wrote off  of goodwill in conjunction with the sale of interests in our wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts 
in we wrote off  of goodwill on our traverse city and blue harbor resorts as the implied fair value of the goodwill  as discussed above  was deemed less than the carrying value 
in the fourth quarter of  as part of our annual impairment assessment of our remaining goodwill on our kansas city and mason resorts  we considered various pieces of information  including budget information  the impact of the december holiday season on overall financial results  full year financial results for each of the resorts  impact of changes in the economy since the severe economic disruptions of  and forecasted booking trends for we required all of this information to complete our impairment assessments 
we concluded that the implied fair value of the goodwill  as discussed above  on our kansas city and mason resorts was less than the carrying value of those goodwill amounts for each of the resorts 
as a result  we wrote off  of goodwill on our kansas city and mason resorts in the fourth quarter 
as of december   all goodwill has been written off 
intangible assets when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate that the carrying value of an indefinite lived intangible asset may be impaired  we perform an analysis to review the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as 
table of contents operating expenses  which reduce net income 
future adverse changes in the hospitality and lodging industry  market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying real estate assets could result in future losses or the inability to recover the carrying value of these intangibles 
we had no impairment losses related to intangible assets in any of the periods presented 
our consolidated balance sheet reflects approximately  of intangible assets related to our great wolf lodge brand name 
this brand name intangible asset has an indefinite life 
investments in affiliates when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate that the carrying value of our investments in affiliates may be impaired  we perform an analysis to review the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
to test investment in affiliates for impairment  we compare the fair value of the investment in affiliates with its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the investment in affiliates is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
future adverse changes in the hospitality and lodging industry  market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investments could result in future losses or the inability to recover the carrying value of these assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that continued adverse current and expected market conditions for our wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts indicated that our minority investment in the joint venture that owns these resorts may be impaired 
accordingly  we conducted an analysis  as described above  to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our investments in that affiliate 
as part of that analysis  we considered various pieces of information  including budget information  the impact of the december holiday season on overall financial results  the relative success of operational adjustments implemented throughout to improve the resorts operations  full year financial results for each of the resorts  impact of changes in the economy since the severe economic disruptions of  and forecasted booking trends for we required all of this information to complete our impairment analysis 
when we had obtained and completed our evaluation of this information in early  we concluded that the fair value of our investment in this joint venture  as discussed above  was less than its carrying value 
as a result  we recorded an  impairment loss related to our interest in the joint venture that owns the wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts  as the implied fair value of the investment  as discussed above  was less than its carrying value 
we do not believe current circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our minority investment in the joint venture that owns our grand mound resort may be impaired 
the carrying value in this joint venture is  as of december  the carrying value of our interest in our joint venture that owns the great wolf lodge in grand mound is  as of december  accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we record net deferred tax assets primarily resulting from net operating loss carryforwards to the extent we 
table of contents believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income that could result from a sale of one or more of our resorts where there s a sales price in excess of tax basis  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
conversely  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets  we would establish a valuation allowance which would increase the provision for income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and  for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
these federal and state carryforwards begin expiring in and  respectively 
based on our analysis  we believe all but  of the net operating loss carryforwards will be realized  therefore we have established a valuation allowance as of december  of  the tax effected benefit of that operating loss carryforward 
the valuation allowance is included in a deferred tax asset  and classified in other assets on the balance sheet

non gaap financial measures we use ebitda as a measure of our operating performance 
ebitda is a supplemental non gaap financial measure 
ebitda is commonly defined as net income plus a net interest expense  b income taxes  and c depreciation and amortization 
ebitda as calculated by us is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
in addition  ebitda a does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap  b is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our cash flow needs  and c should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or our other financial information as determined under gaap 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because a significant portion of our assets consists of property and equipment that are depreciated over their remaining useful lives in accordance with gaap 
because depreciation and amortization are non cash items  we believe that presentation of ebitda is a useful measure of our operating performance  it is widely used in the hospitality and entertainment industries to measure operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  and we believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of items directly resulting from our asset base  primarily depreciation and amortization  from our operating results 
our management uses ebitda as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of items directly resulting from our asset base  primarily depreciation and amortization  from our operating results  for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget  as a valuation measure for evaluating our operating performance and our capacity to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and expand our business  and as one measure in determining the value of other acquisitions and dispositions 
using a measure such as ebitda has material limitations 
these limitations include the difficulty associated with comparing results among companies and the inability to analyze certain significant items  including depreciation and interest expense  which directly affect our net income or loss 
management 
table of contents compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently  as well as in connection with its analysis of net income 
the following table reconciles net loss to ebitda for the periods presented year ended december  net loss adjustments interest expense  net of interest income income tax benefit depreciation and amortization ebitda results of operations general our results of operations for the years ended december  and are not directly comparable primarily due to the opening of our great wolf lodge resort in grapevine  texas in december great wolf resorts financial information our financial information includes our subsidiary entity that provides resort development and management licensing services  our traverse city  kansas city  sheboygan  williamsburg  pocono mountains  mason and grapevine operating resorts  equity interests in resorts in which we have ownership interests but which we do not consolidate  and our resort that is under construction which we will consolidate 
revenues 
our revenues consist of lodging revenue  which includes rooms  food and beverage  and other department revenues from our resorts  management fee and other revenue from resorts  which includes fees received under our management  license  development and construction management agreements  and other revenue from managed properties 
we employ the staff at our managed properties except for the niagara falls resort 
under our management agreements  the resort owners reimburse us for payroll  benefits and certain other costs related to the operations of the managed properties 
eitf  income statement characteristics of reimbursements for out of pocket expenses  establishes standards for accounting for reimbursable expenses in our statements of operations 
under this pronouncement  the reimbursement of payroll  benefits and costs is recorded as other revenue from managed properties on our statements of operations  with a corresponding expense recorded as other expenses from managed properties 
operating expenses 
our departmental operating expenses consist of rooms  food and beverage and other department expenses 
our other operating expenses include the following items selling  general and administrative expenses  which are associated with the operations and management of resorts and which consist primarily of expenses such as corporate payroll and related benefits  
table of contents operations management  sales and marketing  finance  legal  information technology support  human resources and other support services  as well as general corporate expenses  property operation and maintenance expenses  such as utility costs and property taxes  depreciation and amortization  and other expenses from managed properties  which are recorded as an expense in accordance with eitf year ended december  compared with year ended december  the following table shows key operating statistics for our resorts for the years ended december  and all properties a same store comparison b increase decrease occupancy n a adr revpar total revpor total revpar a includes results for properties that were open for any portion of the period  for all owned and or managed resorts

as a result  total revenue  rooms revenue and other revenue for the years ended december  and are not directly comparable

as a result of the issuance of fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities and the accounting profession s application of the guidance provided by the fasb  issue trusts  like trust i and trust iii collectively  the trusts  are generally variable interest entities 
we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary under the trusts  and accordingly we do not include the financial statements of the trusts in our consolidated financial statements 
based on the foregoing accounting authority  our consolidated financial statements present the debentures issued to the trusts as long term debt 
our investments in the trusts are accounted as cost investments and are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet

city of sheboygan bonds the city of sheboygan the city bonds represent the face amount of bond anticipation notes bans issued by the city in november in conjunction with the construction of the blue harbor resort in sheboygan  wisconsin 
in accordance with the provisions of eitf issue no 
 we have recognized as a liability the obligations for the bans 
we have an obligation to fund certain minimum guaranteed amounts of room tax payments to be made by the blue harbor resort through  which obligation is indirectly related to the payments by the city on the bans 
city of sheboygan loan the city of sheboygan loan amount represents a loan made by the city in in conjunction with the construction of the blue harbor resort in sheboygan  wisconsin 
the loan is noninterest bearing and matures in our obligation to repay the loan will be satisfied by certain minimum guaranteed amounts of real and personal property tax payments to be made by the blue harbor resort through future maturities future principal requirements on long term debt are as follows thereafter total 
table of contents short term liquidity requirements our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses for the next months  including recurring maintenance  repairs and other operating expenses necessary to properly maintain and operate our resorts  debt maturities within the next year  property taxes and insurance expenses  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  general and administrative expenses  and income taxes 
historically  we have satisfied our short term liquidity requirements through operating cash flows and cash on hand 
we believe that cash provided by our operations  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to fund our short term liquidity requirements for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service for the next months  assuming that we are successful in negotiating an additional extension of the maturity date or a refinancing for our mason mortgage loan that matures in november  as discussed below 
long term liquidity requirements our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the following items for periods beyond the next months scheduled debt maturities  costs associated with the development of new resorts  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our resorts  and capital contributions and loans to unconsolidated joint ventures 
we expect to meet these needs through existing working capital  cash provided by operations  proceeds from investing activities  including sales of partial or whole ownership interests in certain of our resorts  and proceeds from financing activities  including mortgage financing on properties being developed  additional borrowings under future credit facilities  contributions from joint venture partners  and the issuance of equity instruments  including common stock  or additional or replacement debt  as market conditions permit 
we believe these sources of capital will be sufficient to provide for our long term capital needs 
our mason mortgage loan in the amount of  matures in november we have provided the mason mortgage loan lenders with a  corporate guaranty and cross collateralization on the our grapevine resort 
the corporate guaranty and cross collateralization on the grapevine property will remain in place until we make a  million principal reduction of the mason loan over the remaining term of the loan 
should there be certain liquidity producing events  including the sale of majority owned equity interest in any of the our existing properties or the refinance of a mortgage loan on an existing property  we will be required to use percent of the net proceeds toward the  mandatory principal reduction 
we expect to satisfy the  mandatory principal reduction through one of these liquidity providing events  cash generated by operations  or a combination of these items 
we do not currently or project to have sufficient liquidity to repay this loan at its maturity date 
also  given current capital markets conditions  we do not believe we will be able to pursue refinancing the mason loan with a new lender until late in at the earliest 
in the event we are unable to refinance this loan  we expect to enter into discussions with the lender to obtain a modification allowing us to extend the loan s maturity date 
in the event we are unable to obtain such a modification in that circumstance  however  the nonpayment of the remaining principal balance in november would constitute an event of default under the terms of the mortgage loan 
in an event of 
table of contents default  interest on the loan would accrue at an annual rate of basis points higher than the normal interest rate on the loan  in addition  the lender would have the right to foreclose on the property 
our largest long term expenditures are expected to be for capital expenditures  development of future resorts and capital contributions or loans to joint ventures owning resorts under construction or development 
such expenditures were  for the year ended december  we expect to have approximately  of such expenditures in this amount consists primarily of remaining construction costs to complete our concord resort scheduled to open in march  remaining construction costs to compete the expansion of our existing grapevine resort  and recurring maintenance capital expenditures at our existing properties 
as discussed above  we expect to meet these requirements through a combination of cash provided by operations  cash on hand  contributions from new joint venture partners  proceeds from investing activities and proceeds from financing activities 
we currently project that the combination of our cash on hand plus cash provided by operations in will be sufficient to meet the short term liquidity requirements  as described above 
based on our current projections  however  we do not believe that we will have sufficient excess amounts of cash available in in order either to begin development of any new resorts following the completion of construction of our concord resort or to make capital contributions to new joint ventures that may wish to develop a resort that we would license and manage 
also  due to the current state of the capital markets  which is marked by the general unavailability of debt financing for future development  we expect to have no significant expenditures for development of new resorts until we have all equity and debt capital amounts fully committed  including our projected ability to fund our required equity contribution to a project 
we believe this may result in our not making any significant expenditures in for development of new resorts or capital contributions to new joint venture that may develop future resorts 
off balance sheet arrangements we have two unconsolidated joint venture arrangements at december  we account for our unconsolidated joint ventures using the equity method of accounting 
our joint venture with cnl income properties  inc cnl owns two resorts  great wolf lodge wisconsin dells  wisconsin and great wolf lodge sandusky  ohio 
we are a limited partner with a ownership interest in the cnl joint venture 
at december   the joint venture had aggregate outstanding indebtedness to third parties of  this loan is a mortgage loan that is non recourse to us 
in december  we recorded an  impairment loss related to our interest in the joint venture  as the implied fair value of the investment  as discussed above  was less than its carrying value 
we have entered into our joint venture with the confederated tribes of the chehalis reservation to develop a great wolf lodge resort and conference center on a acre land parcel in grand mound  washington 
this joint venture is a limited liability company  we are a member of that limited liability company with a ownership interest 
at december   the joint venture had aggregate outstanding indebtedness to third parties of  as of december   we have made combined loan and equity contributions  net of loan repayments  of  to the joint venture to fund a portion of construction cost of the resort 
in january  the other member of the joint venture purchased  of our loan at par 
we expect that capital will be required to fund the activities of the resorts owned by these joint ventures and we may in the future fund either or both of the joint ventures share of the costs not funded by the majority owner of the joint venture  the joint ventures operations or outside financing 
in particular  the resorts owned by the cnl joint venture have been adversely affected by a regional economic downturn and greater than expected competitive pressures 
in february  we made a capital contribution to the cnl joint venture 
we are working with our partner to develop strategies to improve the performance of the properties and minimize any potential future capital funding by the joint venture s partners 

table of contents based on the nature of the activities conducted in these joint ventures  we cannot estimate with any degree of accuracy amounts that we may be required to fund in the long term 
we do not currently believe that any additional future funding of these joint ventures will have an adverse effect on our financial condition  as we currently do not expect to make any significant future capital contributions to these joint ventures 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payment terms less than more than total year years years years debt obligations operating lease obligations construction contracts reserve on unrecognized tax benefits total amounts include interest for fixed rate debt and principal 
they also include  of fixed rate debt recognized as a liability related to certain bonds issued by the city of sheboygan and  of fixed rate debt recognized as a liability related to a loan from the city of sheboygan 
these liabilities will be satisfied by certain future minimum guaranteed amounts of real and personal property tax payments and room tax payments to be made by our sheboygan resort 
as we develop future resorts  we expect to incur significant additional debt and construction contract obligations 
working capital we had  of available cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of  current assets less current liabilities at december   compared to the  of available cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of  at december  the primary reasons for the working capital deficit are the use of cash for capital expenditures and investments in and advances to affiliates and for our properties under development  less proceeds from issuances of long term debt  and the classification of our mason mortgage loan maturing in november as a current liability 
cash flows comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities operating activities 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from an increase in equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates  during the year ended december  as compared to december  investing activities 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   resulted primarily from decreased capital 
table of contents expenditures for our properties that are in service and under development  a decrease in cash used to fund our investments in unconsolidated affiliates  and the receipt of payments on a loan from one of our joint ventures 
financing activities 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the proceeds from our williamsburg loan during the year ended december  the increase from the loan proceeds were offset partially by an increase in principal payments and loan costs 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities investing activities 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   resulted primarily from increased capital expenditures for our properties that are in service and our development properties 
this increase in net cash used was also due to distributions received in from our unconsolidated related party 
financing activities 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from less proceeds received from issuances of long term debt in as compared to offset by draws on our mason and grapevine construction loans during the year ended december  inflation we generally are able to change room and amenity rates at our resort properties on a daily basis  so the impact of higher inflation can often be passed along to customers 
however  a weak economic environment that decreases overall demand for our products and services could restrict our ability to raise room and amenity rates to offset rising costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent  in part  upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our earnings are also affected by the changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest income from cash and short term investments  and our interest expense from variable rate debt instruments 
we may use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risks related to our borrowings 
we do not intend to use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had total indebtedness of approximately  this debt consisted of  of fixed rate debt secured by two of our resorts 
this debt bears interest at 
 of variable rate debt secured by one of our resorts 
this debt bears interest at a floating rate of day libor plus a spread of basis points  with a minimum rate of per annum 
the effective rate was at december   of fixed rate debt secured by one of our resorts

the effective rate was at december   of variable rate debt secured by one of our resorts 
this debt bears interest at a floating rate of day libor plus a spread of basis points 
the effective rate was at december   of variable rate debt secured by one of our resorts 
this debt bears interest at a floating annual rate of libor plus a spread of basis points during the construction period and libor plus a 
table of contents spread of basis points once the resort is open  with a minimum rate of per annum 
the effective rate was at december   of subordinated debentures that bear interest at a fixed rate of through march and then at a floating rate of libor plus basis points thereafter 
the securities mature in march  of subordinated debentures that bear interest at a fixed rate of through june and then at a floating rate of libor plus basis points thereafter 
the securities mature in june  of fixed rate debt effective interest rate of recognized as a liability related to certain bonds issued by the city of sheboygan and  of noninterest bearing debt recognized as a liability related to a loan from the city of sheboygan 
these liabilities will be satisfied by certain future minimum guaranteed amounts of real and personal property tax payments and room tax payments to be made by the sheboygan resort 
as of december   we estimate the total fair value of the indebtedness described above to be  less than their total carrying values  due to the terms of the existing debt being different than those terms we believe would currently be available to us for indebtedness with similar risks and remaining maturities 
if libor were to increase by or basis points  the increase in interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately annually  based on our debt balances outstanding and current interest rates in effect as of december  if libor were to decrease by or basis points  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would be approximately annually  based on our debt balances outstanding as of december
