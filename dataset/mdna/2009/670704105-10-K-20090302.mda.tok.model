item business 
overview we are a medical device company focused on the design  development and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders 
our currently marketed product portfolio is focused on applications for spine fusion surgery  a market estimated to exceed billion in the united states in our principal product offering includes a minimally disruptive surgical platform called maximum access surgery  or mas tm  as well as a growing offering of cervical  biologics and motion preservation products 
our currently marketed products are used predominantly in spine fusion surgeries  both to enable access to the spine and to perform restorative and fusion procedures 
we focus significant research and development efforts to expand our mas product platform  advance the applications of our unique technology to additional procedures  and develop motion preserving products such as total disc replacement and nucleus like cervical disc replacement 
we dedicate significant resources toward training spine surgeons on our unique technology and products 
currently  we are training approximately to surgeons annually 
our mas platform combines four categories of our product offerings neurovision a proprietary software driven nerve avoidance system  maxcess a unique split blade design retraction system providing enhanced surgical access to the spine  biologics includes our formagraft and osteocel line of products  and specialized implants includes our spherx pedicle screw system  and coroent suite of implants 
we believe our mas platform provides a unique and comprehensive solution for safe and reproducible minimally disruptive surgical treatment of spine disorders by enabling surgeons to access the spine in a manner that affords direct visibility and avoidance of critical nerves 
the fundamental difference between our mas platform and what has been previously named mis  or minimally invasive surgery  is the ability to customize safe and reproducible access to the spine while allowing surgeons to continue to use instruments that are familiar to them 

table of contents simply stated  the mas platform does not force surgeons to reinvent approaches that add complexity and undermine safety  ease and efficacy 
an important ongoing objective has been to maintain a leading position in access and nerve avoidance  as well as being the leader and pioneer in lateral surgery 
our mas platform  with the unique advantages provided by neurovision  enables an innovative lateral procedure known as extreme lateral interbody fusion  or xlif  in which surgeons access the spine for a fusion procedure from the side of the patient s body  rather than from the front or back 
our maxcess instruments provide access to the spine in a manner that affords direct visibility and our neurovision system allows surgeons to avoid critical nerves 
we believe that the procedures facilitated by our mas platform reduce operating times  decrease trauma and blood loss  and lead to faster overall patient recovery times compared to open spine surgery 
in recent years we have significantly expanded our product offering relating to procedures in the cervical spine as well as in the area of biologics 
our cervical product offering now provides a full set of solutions for cervical fusion surgery  including both allograft and coroent implants  as well as cervical plating and posterior fixation products 
our biologic offering began in with the acquisition of rights to formagraft  a collagen synthetic product used to aid the fusion process 
this offering expanded in with the acquisition of osteocel from osiris therapeutics  an allograft cellular matrix containing viable mesenchymal stem cells  or mscs  to aid in spinal fusion 
we also offer a suite of traditional spine surgery products  including certain products in our coroent suite of implants  a titanium surgical mesh system  a line of precision machined cervical and lumbar allograft implants  and related instrumentation 
our triad and extensure tm lines of bone allograft  in our patented saline packaging  is human bone that has been processed and precision shaped for transplant 
we also offer fusion fixation products that offer unique technological benefits such as our gradient plus tm cervical plate and spherx pedicle screw system 
our corporate headquarters are located in a  square foot facility in san diego  california 
this facility has a six suite state of the art cadaver operating theatre designed to accommodate the training of spine surgeons 
our primary distribution and warehousing operations are located in our facility in memphis  tennessee 
our business requires overnight delivery of products and surgical instruments for almost all surgeries involving our products 
because of its location and proximity to overnight third party transporters  our memphis facility has greatly enhanced our ability to meet demanding delivery schedules and provide a greater level of customer service 
recent product introductions in the last several years  we have introduced numerous new products and product enhancements that have significantly expanded our mas platform  enhanced the applications of the xlif procedure  expanded our offering of cervical products  and marked our entrance into the growing motion preservation market 
we have also acquired complementary and strategic assets and technology  particularly in the area of biologics 
our newly launched and acquired products are exemplified by the following categories implants our implant products have historically focused on the lumbar spine  with our recent and planned product introductions  we will increasingly address the cervical and thoracic spine as well 
these products include spherx ii dbr ii pedicle screw systems are pedicle screw systems designed for a posterior approach  which have been enhanced with a dual ball rod feature to allow for instrument free compression of the vertebrae  as well as minimally disruptive rod delivery features that minimize the incidence of associated tissue trauma 
additionally  there is no rod overhang affecting anatomic structures adjacent to the fusion construct 
xlp tm lateral plate is a fixation plate designed to be placed through the same incision used in an xlif procedure and to perform a similar fixation function as pedicle screws without the need for an additional incision or to reposition the patient 
this single approach fixation saves the patient the morbidity of another approach to the spine for adjunctive fixation 
additionally  the surgeon and hospital save significant time and money related to applying posterior fixation 
thoracic xlif the thoracic spine can now be accessed for spine surgery and the use of implants in the same safe and reproducible way xlif has demonstrated in the lumbar spine 

table of contents gradient plus continued evolution of our cervical plating system that provides construct options constrained  semi constrained  or translational that best satisfy the patient specific requirements 
whether using controlled translation that allows the plate to settle in concert with the eventual implant or a fixed construct for trauma application  gradient plus provides the benefit of intraoperative choice when selecting the construct that best satisfies patient need 
helix acp tm and helix mini acp tm are plates designed for the anterior approach in cervical surgeries 
this combination of plates feature a one step canted coil locking mechanism for surgical ease and efficiency and provide multiple surgical options for cervical fixation 
vuepoint tm oct is a posterior cervical fixation system comprised of rods  hooks  and screws 
it is designed with full junctional capabilities  easily allowing occipito cervical and cervico thoracic junctional fixation 
coroent family of products are designed in response to the demand from spine surgeons for implants with superior anatomical fit that are simple to position and align 
the coroent family of products consists of multiple shapes and sizes  several designed to be inserted using a patented insert and rotate technique  which minimizes damage to the surrounding bone 
each of these coroent products is made of peek optima  a biocompatible polymer commonly used in implantable devices 
in  the following coroent products were introduced coroent slp cervical  coroent lo large oblique  coroent li large impacted  coroent xl c coronal tapered  coroent xl w extra large wide  and coroent xl affix tm is a plate that facilitates fusion between two spinous processes 
it is often used with our next generation extensure h product to stabilize and restore foraminal volume enabling nerves to pass freely 
access a key element of our mas platform is the safe and customizable access it affords to the spine 
the core of this offering is our maxcess retractor system 
we seek to maintain a competitive advantage through the introduction of our maxcess products to customers 
our offering of maxcess retractors now provides access for surgery in all areas of the spine 
we have launched two completely revised versions of our maxcess retractor system over the last few years  with the current version being maxcess iii 
maxcess iii maintains the split blade design of the original product and incorporates our neurovision nerve avoidance technology within the posterior retraction blade 
maxcess iii also adds a removable fourth blade  which provides greater posterior surgical options and incorporates an improved tilted blade locking mechanism 
maxcess micro access system is the smallest  lightest version of our maxcess retractor systems  and is designed to provide access during posterior lumbar and cervical decompression surgeries 
neurovision m tm is  along with its predecessors  the enabling technology for the xlif procedure  and utilizes proprietary technology and hunting algorithms to locate and avoid critical nerves during surgery 
neurovision m refers to five monitoring modalities  covering the entire spine  available in this enhanced version of our technology  which include i stimulated electromyography emg  ii free run emg  iii motor evoked potentials meps  iv somatosensory evoked potentials sseps  and v navigated guidance 
the new modalities  in further detail  include full spinal cord monitoring neurovision now incorporates multiple monitoring modalities  allowing monitoring of the entire spinal cord mep and ssep 
remote monitoring neurovision has also been updated to allow for remote monitoring  providing the ability to monitor surgeries both intraoperatively and remotely  allowing for more efficient case coverage 
navigated guidance guidance technology that enables precise pedicle screw placement replicated from pre operation planning 
this technology also potentially decreases the amount of radiation exposure to surgeons and patients during procedures 
system updates an update providing a new graphical user interface that allows for greater ease of use by the surgical staff 
neurovision has also been given a new harness with redesigned connectors  to 
table of contents streamline the application of surface electrodes during patient preparation that relay muscle activity to the monitoring system 
biologics we have expanded our product offerings in the last few years to include products in the biologics market 
the biologics market in spine surgery has grown to approximately billion and consists of autograft autologous human tissue  allograft donated human tissue  a varied offering of synthetic products  stem cell based products  and growth factors 
we made our initial entry into this market in by acquiring rights to formagraft  a collagen based synthetic product 
we expanded this offering in by acquiring osteocel  an allograft cellular matrix containing viable mscs to aid in fusion 
additionally  in early we made an investment in progentix orthobiology bv  a private company working to develop a novel synthetic 
this investment includes options and obligations to buy progentix orthobiology bv over time as development milestones are achieved 
our strategy our objective is to become a leading provider of creative medical products that provide comprehensive solutions for the surgical treatment of spine disorders 
we are pursuing the following business strategies in order to achieve this objective establish our mas platform as a standard of care 
we believe our mas platform has the potential to become the standard of care for minimally invasive spine surgery as spine surgeons continue to adopt our products and recognize their benefits 
we also believe that our mas platform has the potential to dramatically improve the clinical results of minimally invasive spine surgery 
we dedicate significant resources to educating spine surgeons on the clinical benefits of our products  and we intend to capitalize on patient demand for minimally disruptive surgical alternatives 
continue to introduce new creative products 
one of our core competencies is our ability to develop and commercialize creative spine surgery products 
in the past three years  we have introduced more than new products and product enhancements 
we have several additional products currently under development that should expand our presence in fusion surgery as well as provide an entry into the motion preservation market segment 
we intend to accomplish this with an unwavering commitment to our mas platform and building on our core technology 
we also intend to selectively acquire unique products or technologies that we believe will keep us on the forefront of innovation 
we believe that these additional products will allow us to generate  on average  greater revenues per spine surgery procedure while improving patient care 
establish exclusive sales force with broad reach 
we believe that having a sales force dedicated to selling only our spine surgery products is critical to achieve continued growth across product lines  greater market penetration and increased sales 
in  we completed our transition to an exclusive sales force  and we have seen the benefits of that effort 
our sales force is achieving deeper penetration in our accounts and further establishing nuvasive as a technology leader in the spine industry 
our exclusive sales force is comprised of four area vice presidents  each of whom is responsible for a geographic region of the country 
each area vice president is responsible for sales directors  who in turn are responsible for area business managers  or abms  who are nuvasive shareowners our employees responsible for a defined territory 
the remainder of the sales force are both direct our shareowners and exclusive independent sales representatives or exclusive distributor agents  each acting as our sole representative and selling only nuvasive spine products in a given territory 
provide tailored solutions in response to surgeon needs 
responding quickly to the needs of spine surgeons  which we refer to as absolute responsiveness  is central to our corporate culture  critical to our success and  we believe  differentiates us from our competition 
we solicit information and feedback from our surgeon customers and clinical advisors regarding the utility of and potential improvements to our products 
for example  we have an on site machine shop to allow us to rapidly manufacture product prototypes and a state of the art cadaver operating theatre to provide clinical training and validate new ideas through prototype testing 

table of contents selectively license or acquire complementary spine products and technologies 
in addition to building our company through internal product development efforts  we intend to selectively license or acquire complementary products and technologies 
by acquiring complementary products  we believe we can leverage our expertise at bringing new products to market and provide additional selling opportunities for our sales force 
we have acquired complementary and strategic assets  including i cervical plate technology  which we re launched as our smartplate gradient clp product  ii surgical embroidery technology  including the neodisc investigational nucleus like cervical disc replacement  iii our formagraft bone graft biologic product and iv osteocel  an allograft stem cell based biologic product 
we will continue to be opportunistic in this regard as we seek to expand our market share 
industry background and market the spine is the core of the human skeleton  and provides a crucial balance between structural support and flexibility 
it consists of separate bones called vertebrae that are connected together by connective tissue to permit a normal range of motion 
the spinal cord  the body s central nerve conduit  is enclosed within the spinal column 
vertebrae are paired into what are called motion segments that move by means of three joints two facet joints and one spine disc 
the four major categories of spine disorders are degenerative conditions  deformities  trauma and tumors 
the largest market and the focus of our business is degenerative conditions of the facet joints and disc space 
these conditions can result in instability and pressure on the nerve roots as they exit the spinal column  causing back pain or radiating pain in the arms or legs 
the prescribed treatment for spine disorders depends on the severity and duration of the disorder 
initially  physicians will prescribe non operative procedures including bed rest  medication  lifestyle modification  exercise  physical therapy  chiropractic care and steroid injections 
in most cases  non operative treatment options are effective  however  many patients require spine surgery 
it is estimated that in excess of one million patients undergo spine surgery each year in the united states 
the most common spine surgery procedures are discectomy  the removal of all or part of a damaged disc  laminectomy  the removal of all or part of a lamina  or thin layer of bone  to relieve pinching of the nerve and narrowing of the spinal canal  and fusion  where two or more adjoining vertebrae are fused together to provide stability 
all three of these procedures require access to the spine 
traditional open surgical approaches require large incisions to be made in the back so that surgeons can see the spine and surrounding area 
most open procedures are invasive  lengthy and complex  and may result in significant blood loss  extensive dissection of tissue and lengthy hospitalization and rehabilitation 
back pain is one of the number one causes of healthcare expenditures in the united states  with a direct cost of more than billion annually for diagnosis  treatment and rehabilitation 
the us market for lumbar and cervical spine fusion  the focus of our business  was estimated to be over billion in  over billion in  over billion in and is estimated to grow to over billion in we believe that the implant market for spine surgery procedures will continue to grow because of the following market dynamics increased use of implants 
the use of implants has evolved into the standard of care in spine surgery 
over the past five years  there has been a significant increase in the percentage of spine fusion surgeries using implants and it is estimated that over of all spine fusion surgeries now involve implants 
demand for minimally invasive alternatives 
as with other surgical markets  we anticipate that the broader acceptance of minimally invasive spine surgery will result in increased demand for these types of surgical procedures 
increasing demand for motion preserving treatments with potentially earlier intervention in the degenerative disease process for many patients 
favorable demographics 
the population segment most likely to experience back pain is expected to increase as a result of aging baby boomers  people born between and we believe this population segment will demand a quicker return to activities of daily living following surgery than prior generations 

table of contents minimally invasive surgical procedures the benefits of minimally invasive surgery procedures in other areas of orthopedics have significantly contributed to the strong and growing demand for minimally invasive surgery of the spine 
surgeons and hospitals seek spine procedures that result in fewer operative complications  shorter surgery times and decreased hospitalization 
at the same time  patients seek procedures that cause less trauma and allow for faster recovery times 
despite these benefits  the rate of adoption of minimally invasive surgical procedures has been relatively slow with respect to the spine 
we believe the two principal factors contributing to spine surgeons slow adoption of minimally invasive alternatives are i the limited or lack of direct access to and visibility of the surgical anatomy  and ii the associated complex instruments that have been required to perform these procedures 
most minimally invasive systems do not allow the surgeon to directly view the spine and provide only restrictive visualization through a camera system or endoscope  while also requiring the use of complex surgical techniques 
in addition  most minimally invasive systems use complex or highly customized surgical instruments that require special training and the completion of a large number of trial cases before the surgeon becomes proficient using the system 
the nuvasive solution maximum access surgery mas our mas platform allows surgeons to perform a wide range of minimally disruptive procedures  while overcoming the shortcomings of alternative minimally invasive surgical techniques 
we believe our products improve clinical results and have both the potential to expand the number of minimally disruptive procedures performed and become a standard of care in spine fusion and non fusion surgery 
our mas platform combines four product categories neurovision  maxcess  biologics and specialized implants 
neurovision enables surgeons to navigate around nerves while maxcess affords direct customized access to the spine for implant delivery 
maxcess also allows surgeons to use well established traditional instruments in a minimally disruptive and less traumatic manner while our biologics offering compliments our mas platform by facilitating fusion 
we also offer a variety of specialized implants that enable sufficient structural support while conforming to the anatomical requirements of the patient 
our products facilitate minimally disruptive applications of the following spine surgery procedures  among others lumbar fusion procedures in which the surgeon approaches the spine through the patient s back or abdomen  decompression  which is removal of a portion of bone over the nerve root or disc from under the nerve root to relieve pinching of the nerve  and procedures designed to correct and or stabilize the spine while simultaneously maintaining motion 
importantly  our products also enable innovative procedures such as the xlif 
the xlif procedure  which we developed with leading spine surgeons  allows surgeons to access the spine from the side of the patient s body rather than from the front or back  which results in less operating time and reduced patient trauma and blood loss 
we believe procedures enabled by our mas platform have significant benefits 
a multi center evaluation study of xlif procedures performed in and and subsequent reports and publications presented at multiple meetings through support our belief that our mas platform provides the following benefits reduced surgery times 
xlif procedures utilizing our mas platform  which we refer to as mas xlif  have averaged about one hour to perform which we believe is substantially shorter than it takes to perform an equivalent open procedure 
reduced hospital stays 
hospital stays following a mas xlif procedure have averaged one to two days which we believe is substantially shorter than the hospital stays associated with an equivalent open procedure 
reduced pain and recovery times 
due to smaller incisions and less trauma and blood loss for the patient  we believe that the pain and recovery time for patients following a mas xlif procedure is significantly less 
table of contents than with an equivalent open procedure 
in most cases  patients are walking the same day as surgery following a mas xlif 
mas neurovision neurovision utilizes electromyography  or emg  and proprietary algorithms and graphical user interfaces to provide surgeons with an enhanced nerve avoidance system 
our system functions by monitoring changes in electrical signals across muscle groups  which allows us to detect underlying changes in nerve activity 
we connect the instruments that surgeons use to a computer system that provides real time feedback during surgery 
our system analyzes and then translates complex neurophysiologic data into simple  useful information to assist the surgeon s clinical decision making process 
in addition  during a pedicle screw test  in which the integrity of the bone where the implant is placed is tested  if the insertion of a screw results in a breach of the bone  a red light and corresponding numeric value will result so that the surgeon may reposition the implant to avoid potential nerve impingement or irritation 
if no breach of the bone occurs  a green light and corresponding numeric value will result 
the initial application of neurovision  screw test with our ins system  was cleared by the u 
s food and drug administration  or fda  in november and commercially launched in surgeons can dynamically link familiar surgical instruments to neurovision  thus creating an interactive set of instruments that enable the safe navigation of neural anatomy 
the connection is accomplished using a clip that is attached to the instrument  effectively providing the benefits of neurovision through an instrument already familiar to the surgeon 
the system s proprietary software and easy to use graphical user interface enables the surgeon to make critical decisions in real time resulting in safer and faster procedures with the potential for improved patient outcomes 
with recent additions  the health and integrity of the spinal cord can also be assessed using motor evoked potentials meps and somatosensory evoked potentials sseps 
both methods of intraoperative monitoring involve applying stimulation and recording the response that must travel along the motor or sensory aspect of the spinal cord 
the data developed using neurovision can now be sent to health care professionals for additional interpretation of intraoperative information via networking capabilities and software that allows real time assessment from remote locations 
mas maxcess our maxcess system consists of instrumentation and specialized implants that provide maximum access to the spine with minimal soft tissue disruption 
maxcess has a split blade design consisting of three blades that can be positioned to build the surgical exposure in the shape and size specific to the surgical requirements rather than the fixed tube design of other minimally invasive surgical systems 
maxcess split blade design also provides expanded access to the spine  which allows surgeons to perform surgical procedures using instruments that are similar to those used in open procedures but with a significantly smaller incision 
the ability to use familiar instruments reduces the learning curve and facilitates the adoption of our products 
our system s illumination of the operative corridor aids in providing surgeons with direct visualization of the patient s anatomy  without the need for additional technology or other special equipment 
maxcess ii is a second generation of our maxcess retractor that incorporates neurovision within the posterior retraction blade  providing built in nerve monitoring capabilities 
maxcess ii features superior and inferior blades that kick out at an angle to spread the tissue closest to the pathology point further than original maxcess 
maxcess iii is our most advanced retractor system 
maxcess iii is a further enhancement of the previous maxcess systems the maxcess and maxcess ii systems  with the addition of several features that improve access to the spine 
maxcess iii maintains the split blade design and continues to incorporate neurovision nerve avoidance technology within the posterior retraction blade 
maxcess iii adds a removable fourth blade  which provides greater posterior surgical options and incorporates an improved tilted blade locking mechanism 
maxcess micro access system is a product that brings all of the benefits of minimally disruptive surgery to both the cervical spine for posterior application and the lumbar spine for decompression 

table of contents our maxcess products have now been used in the thoracic region of the spine as the lateral approach has broadened from the lumbar to the thoracic region as well as into adult degenerative scoliosis procedures 
mas specialized implants we have a number of implants designed to be used with our mas platform 
these implants are used for interbody disc height restoration for fusion  partial vertebral body replacement and stabilization of the spine 
these implants include our spherx  spherx ii and spherx ii dbr pedicle screw systems  our xlp lateral plate  our coroent family of unique implants for partial vertebral body replacement and interbody implants  precision machined allograft implants  as well as numerous new implants currently under development 
our implants are available in a variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate the anatomical requirements of the patient and the particular fusion procedure 
our implants are designed for insertion into the smallest possible space while maximizing surface area contact for fusion 
our fixation systems have been uniquely designed to be delivered through our maxcess system to provide stabilization of the spine 
these systems enable minimally disruptive placement of implants and are intended to reduce operating time and patient morbidity  often through a single approach 
we have developed a suite of traditional spine surgery products  including a line of precision machined cervical and lumbar allograft implants  a titanium surgical mesh system  and related instrumentation 
allograft implant tissue is recovered from deceased human donors  which is processed into specified sizes and shapes and sterilized for implantation 
unlike other suppliers of allograft implants  our patented packaging process allows us to provide a ready to use structural graft eliminating the need for refrigeration and re hydration 
we package all of our allograft implants in a sterile saline solution 
in addition  our allograft implant packaging and instrumentation are color coded to assist the surgeon in selecting the proper size implant for use with the appropriate size instrument 
our traditional product offerings also include fusion plates such as our smartplate gradient clp  a dynamic cervical plate that encompasses a gradient locking mechanism which gradually loads the screws based upon the anatomic requirements 
this allows the plate to settle in concert with the allograft implant settling that occurs within the disc space over time  offering a better anatomical fit 
we also made significant progress in the last couple years on our research and development initiatives related to motion preservation 
the neodisc clinical trial is a prospective  randomized  controlled  multi center clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neodisc by comparing the outcomes of patients to traditional anterior cervical discectomy and fusion 
enrollment began in the third quarter of and is now complete 
our motion preservation product development efforts include our mechanical lateral total disc replacement xl tdr tm 
we filed with the fda for investigational device exemptions  or ides  on the mechanical lateral tdr as well as our ceramic on ceramic cervical tdr  cerpass tm  in late and were granted these ides in mas biologics as part of our mas offering  we have expanded our product offerings in the last couple years to include products in the biologics market 
the biologics market in spine surgery has grown to approximately billion and consists of autograft autologous human tissue  allograft donated human tissue  a varied offering of synthetic products  stem cell based products  and growth factors 
we made our initial entry into this market in by acquiring rights to formagraft  a collagen based synthetic product 
we expanded this offering in by acquiring osteocel  an allograft cellular matrix containing viable mscs to aid in fusion 
additionally  in early we made an investment in progentix orthobiology bv  a private company working to develop a novel synthetic biologic 
this investment includes options and obligations to buy progentix orthobiology bv over time as development milestones are achieved 
development projects we are developing proprietary total disc replacement devices for lateral lumbar spine applications and separately for cervical spine applications 
these devices are intended to allow surgeons to address a patient s pain 
table of contents and dysfunction while maintaining normal range of motion and avoiding future adjacent level degeneration that can occur after spine fusion 
commercialization of these devices  including neodisc  will require premarket approval rather than k clearance 
the neodisc clinical trial is a prospective  randomized  controlled  multi center clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neodisc by comparing the outcomes of patients to traditional anterior cervical discectomy and fusion 
enrollment began in the third quarter of and is now complete 
neodisc is a nucleus like cervical disc replacement device designed to preserve motion in the cervical region of the spine and provide an alternative to pre surgical treatment and mechanical total disc replacement tdr or spinal fusion 
our motion preservation product development efforts include our mechanical lateral total disc replacement xl tdr 
we were granted ides on the mechanical lateral tdr as well as our ceramic on ceramic cervical tdr  cerpass  in in addition to the motion preservation platform  we have many product development projects that are intended to broaden surgical applications and increase fixation options for greater vertical integration of our mas techniques 
additionally  we are expanding our cervical fixation product portfolio to provide for a comprehensive cervical offering that will include segmentation of both fixation and motion markets 
research and development our research and development efforts are primarily focused on developing further enhancements to our existing products  launching new product categories  as well as developing our total disc products 
our research staff consists of shareowners  including seven who hold phd degrees and four who hold other advanced degrees 
our research and development group has extensive experience in developing products to treat spine pathology and this group continues to work closely with our clinical advisors and spine surgeon customers to design products that are intended to improve patient outcomes  simplify techniques  shorten procedures  reduce hospitalization and rehabilitation times and  as a result  reduce costs 
sales and marketing we currently sell our products through a combination of exclusive independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives employed by us 
importantly  both our direct sales representatives as well as our independent sales agencies are exclusive and sell only nuvasive spine surgery products 
our sales force is comprised either of sales professionals  who are nuvasive shareowners responsible for a defined territory or independent sales representatives  each acting as our sole representative in a given territory 
the determination of whether to engage a directly employed shareowner or exclusive distributor is made on a territory by territory basis  with a focus on the candidate who brings the best skills  experience and contacts 
currently  the split between directly employed and independent sales agents in our sales force is roughly equal 
our sales force is managed by a senior vice president of us sales and four area vice presidents 
each area vice president is responsible for a portion of the united states and manages the directly employed and independent sales agents engaged in that territory 
the transition to an exclusive sales force has been a very positive contributor to our growth in sales 
there are many reasons that we believe strongly in an exclusive sales force  none more important than having a sales force that is properly trained and incentivized to sell and represent only our portfolio of products 
surgeon training and education nuvasive devotes significant resources to training and educating surgeons regarding the safety and reproducibility of our surgical techniques and our complimentary instruments and implants 
we maintain a state of the art cadaver operating theatre and training facility at our corporate headquarters to help promote adoption of our products 
currently  we are training approximately to surgeons annually in the xlif technique and our other maximum access surgery  or mas platform  products including neurovision  maxcess and spherx dbr 
nuvasive has also helped to establish solas tm  the society of lateral access surgery  a group of spine surgeons dedicated to the development and expanded application of lateral spine surgery techniques that offer significant patient benefits and improved clinical outcome through peer to peer communication  clinical education efforts  and research 

table of contents manufacturing and supply we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our products  their components and servicing 
we currently maintain alternative manufacturing sources for some components of neurovision  maxcess  and spherx  as well as some of our other finished goods products 
we have and are in the process of identifying and qualifying additional suppliers for our highest volume products to maintain consistent supply to our customers 
our outsourcing strategy is targeted at companies that meet fda  international organization for standardization  or iso  and quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures 
supplier performance is maintained and managed through a corrective action program intended to ensure that all product requirements are met or exceeded 
we believe these manufacturing relationships minimize our capital investment  help control costs  and allow us to compete with larger volume manufacturers of spine surgery products 
following the receipt of products or product components from our third party manufacturers  we conduct inspection and packaging and labeling  as needed  at either our headquarters facility or our distribution facility 
under our existing contracts  we reserve the exclusive right to inspect and assure conformance of each product and product component to our specifications 
in the future  we may consider manufacturing certain products or product components internally  if and when demand or quality requirements make it appropriate to do so 
we currently rely on tissue banks international  inc and allosource  inc as our only suppliers of allograft tissue implants 
our agreements with each of these suppliers automatically renew for successive one year terms unless otherwise terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the respective agreement 
like our relationships with our device manufacturing suppliers  we subject our tissue processing suppliers to the same quality criteria in terms of selection  qualification  and verification of processed tissue quality upon receipt of goods  as well as hold them accountable to compliance with fda regulation  state requirements  as well as voluntary industry standards such as the american association of tissue banks  or aatb 
we acquired neodisc  an investigational cervical disc replacement device  from pearsalls limited 
neodisc is currently the subject of a clinical trial  and our supply of the product comes solely from pearsalls limited 
we are in the process of determining whether to establish alternate suppliers 
we acquired certain rights to formagraft  a ceramic collagen bone graft matrix used to promote spinal fusion  from radius medical  llc 
our supply of the product comes solely from maxigen biotech 
we are in the process of determining whether to establish alternate suppliers 
as part of the acquisition of the osteocel biologics business from osiris therapeutics  inc  osiris will act as our exclusive supplier of osteocel plus for a period of months from the close of the transaction 
in that capacity  we will be highly dependent on osiris for supply of osteocel plus and any failure on their part to process and supply such product will negatively impact our ability to meet projected sales and distribution of the product 
osteocel plus is processed from allograft  which is donated human tissue 
we  and our third party manufacturers  are subject to the fda s quality system regulations  state regulations  such as the regulations promulgated by the california department of health services  and regulations promulgated by the european union 
for tissue products  we are fda registered and licensed in the states of california  new york  florida  maryland and oregon 
for our device implants and instruments  we are fda registered  california licensed  ce marked and iso certified 
ce is an abbreviation for european compliance 
our facility and the facilities of our third party manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities  and may undergo compliance inspections conducted by the fda and corresponding state agencies 
the fda may impose enforcement  inspections or audits at any time 
loaner equipment we seek to deliver surgical instrument sets  including our neurovision systems  just in time to fulfill our customer obligations to meet surgery schedules 
in most cases  once the surgery is finished  the instrument sets are returned to us and we prepare them for shipment to meet future surgeries 
this strategy minimizes backlogs  while increasing asset turns and maximizing cash flow 
our pool of surgical equipment that we loan to or place with hospitals continues to increase as we expand our distribution channels and increase market penetration of our

the medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain 
our success will depend in part on our not infringing patents issued to others  including our competitors and potential competitors 
as the number of entrants into our market increases  the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us grows 
while we take extensive efforts to ensure that our products do not infringe other parties patents and proprietary rights  our products and methods may be covered by patents held by our competitors 
there are numerous risks associated with our intellectual property 
for a complete discussion of these risks  please see the risk factors section of this annual report

competition we are aware of a number of major medical device companies that have developed or plan to develop products for minimally invasive spine surgery in each of our current and future product categories 
our currently marketed products are  and any future products we commercialize will be  subject to intense competition 
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do  and they may succeed in developing products that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  many of these competitors have significantly greater operating history and reputations than we do in their respective fields 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner  receive adequate reimbursement and are safer  less invasive and less expensive than alternatives available for the same purpose 
because of the size of the potential market  we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to developing competing products 
below are our primary competitors grouped by our product categories 
our neurovision system competes with the conventional nerve monitoring systems offered by medtronic sofamor danek  cadwell  and nicolet biomedical 
we believe our system competes favorably with these systems on both price and ease of use for the spine surgeon  with the added advantage that our neurovision system was designed to support surgeon directed applications with automated  real time information 
medtronic s nim eclipse neuromonitoring system  acquired from axon  while surgeon directed  requires manual interpretation for neuromonitoring 
several companies offer products that compete with our maxcess system  spherx pedicle screw system and implants  including competitive offerings by depuy spine  inc  a johnson johnson company  medtronic sofamor danek and stryker spine 
competition is intense in the fusion product market 
we believe that our most significant competitors are medtronic sofamor danek  depuy spine  stryker spine and synthes  inc  each of which has substantially greater sales and financial resources than we do 
medtronic sofamor danek  in particular  has a broad classic fusion product line 
we believe our differentiation in the market is an innovative portfolio of products elegantly delivered through our maxcess system  as well as through our xlif approach  complemented by additional innovative and pull though products along the entirety of the spine 
however  with the introduction of competing lateral techniques we will face more competition in the market 
our allograft implants are packaged in a saline solution  which allows the product to be used immediately and does not require specialized handling  representing a unique product in the allograft implant market 

table of contents competition in the motion preservation segment is increasing  with medtronic  depuy  stryker and synthes all investing in this rapidly growing market 
in the cervical total disc replacement tdr segment  our neodisc  currently in clinical trials  if approved  will face competition from several products that received fda approval in including medtronic s prestige and bryan tdrs as well as synthes prodisc tdr 
while our recent acquisition of osteocel and our investment in progentix orthobiology bv provide us with additional products to compete in the biologics market  competition is increasing 
in addition to our larger competitors  which are investing in their biologics platforms  we face competition from smaller orthobiologics companies such as osteotech 
we also face competition from a significant number of smaller companies with more limited product offerings and geographic reach than our larger competitors 
these companies  who represent intense competition in specified markets  include globus medical  inc  orthofix international nv blackstone medical  inc  biomet ebi spine  alphatec spine  inc  and others 
government regulation our products are medical devices and tissues subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory bodies 
fda regulations govern  among other things  the following activities that we or our partners perform and will continue to perform product design and development  product testing  product manufacturing  product labeling  product storage  premarket clearance or approval  advertising and promotion  and product sales and distribution 
fda s premarket clearance and approval requirements unless an exemption applies  each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the united states will require either prior k clearance or prior premarket approval from the fda 
the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes 
devices deemed to pose lower risk are placed in either class i or ii  which requires the manufacturer to submit to the fda a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution 
this process is known as k clearance 
some low risk devices are exempt from this requirement 
devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk  such as life sustaining  life supporting or implantable devices  or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared k device are placed in class iii  requiring premarket approval 
k clearance pathway to obtain k clearance  a premarket notification must be submitted demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared k device or a device that was in commercial distribution before may  for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications 
the fda s k clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed  but it can take significantly longer 
after a device receives k clearance  any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  will require a new k clearance or could require premarket approval 
the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially  but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer s determination 
if the fda disagrees 
table of contents with a manufacturer s determination  the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until k clearance or premarket approval is obtained 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance or premarket approval for any modifications to a previously cleared product  we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval 
also  in these circumstances  we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements that we believe do not require new k clearances 
premarket approval pathway a premarket approval pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the k process 
a premarket approval application must be supported by extensive data including  but not limited to  technical information  preclinical data  clinical trial data  manufacturing data and labeling to demonstrate  to the fda s satisfaction  the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use 
once a complete pma application is submitted  the fda begins an in depth review which generally takes between one and three years  but may take significantly longer 
during this review period  the fda may request additional information or clarification of information already provided 
also  during the review period  an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device 
in addition  the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with quality system regulations 
new pmas or pma supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process  labeling or design of a device that is approved through the pma process 
pma supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an original pma application  except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original pma application  and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 
human cell  tissue  and cellular and tissue based products our allograft implant products and our osteocel products are regulated by fda as human cell  tissue  and cellular and tissue based products 
fda regulations do not currently require products regulated as minimally manipulated human tissue based products to be k cleared or pma approved before they are marketed 
we are  however  required to register our establishment  list these products with the fda and comply with current good tissue practices for human cell  tissue  and cellular and tissue based product establishments 
the fda periodically inspects tissue processors to determine compliance with these requirements 
violations of applicable regulations noted by the fda during facility inspections could adversely affect the continued marketing of our products 
we believe we comply with all aspects of the current good tissue practices  although there can be no assurance that we will comply  or will comply on a timely basis  in the future 
entities that provide us with allograft bone tissue are responsible for performing donor recovery  donor screening and donor testing and our compliance with those aspects of the current good tissue practices regulations that regulate those functions are dependent upon the actions of these independent entities 
the procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue is subject to us federal law pursuant to the national organ transplant act  or nota  a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation  including bone and related tissue  for valuable consideration 
nota permits reasonable payments associated with the removal  transportation  processing  preservation  quality control  implantation and storage of human bone tissue 
with the exception of removal and implantation  we provide services in all of these areas 
we make payments to vendors in consideration for the services they provide in connection with the recovery and screening of donors 
failure to comply with the requirements of nota could result in enforcement action against us 
the procurement of human tissue is also subject to state anatomical gift acts and some states have statutes similar to nota 
in addition  some states require that tissue processors be licensed by that state 
failure to comply with state laws could also result in enforcement action against us 

table of contents clinical trials a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a k premarket notification 
these trials generally require approval of a submitted application for an ide to the fda 
the ide application must be supported by appropriate data  such as animal and laboratory testing results  showing that it is safe to evaluate the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound 
the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of subjects  unless the product is deemed a non significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated ide requirements 
clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by the fda and the responsible institutional review boards 
future clinical trials of our motion preservation designs and interbody implants will likely require that we obtain ides from the fda prior to commencing clinical trials 
we have gained ide approval from the fda to begin a clinical trial relating to neodisc  our embroidery cervical disc replacement device  and have completed patient enrollment for this trial 
we filed with the fda for ides on the mechanical lateral tdr as well as our ceramic on ceramic tdr  cerpass  and were granted these ides in our clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with fda regulations and other federal regulations concerning human subject protection and privacy and must be publicly registered 
the results of our clinical trials may not be sufficient to obtain approval of our product 
there are numerous risks associated with conducting such a clinical trial  including the high costs and uncertain outcomes 
for a complete discussion of these risks  please see the risk factors section of this annual report 
pervasive and continuing fda regulation after a device is placed on the market  numerous regulatory requirements apply 
these include  but are not limited to quality system regulation  which requires manufacturers to follow design  testing  process control  and other quality assurance procedures  labeling regulations  which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or off label uses and impose other restrictions on labeling  and medical device reporting regulations  which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda  which may include any of the following sanctions fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing our request for k clearance or premarket approval of new products  withdrawing k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted  and criminal prosecution 
we are subject to unannounced device inspections by the fda and the california food and drug branch  as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation and adherence of applicable state and federal tissue licensing regulations 
these inspections may include our subcontractors facilities 

table of contents sales and marketing commercial compliance federal anti kickback laws and regulations prohibit any knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration by an individual or entity in return for  or to induce the referral of an individual for a service or product for which payment may be made by medicare  medicaid or other government sponsored healthcare program  or purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for any service or product for which payment may be made by a government sponsored healthcare program 
possible sanctions for violation of these anti kickback laws include monetary fines  civil and criminal penalties  exclusion from medicare and medicaid programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions 
in addition to the anti kickback law  federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to get a false claim paid 
off label promotion has been pursued as a violation of the federal false claims laws 
pursuant to fda regulations  we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses 
although surgeons are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the fda based on their medical judgment  we are prohibited from promoting products for such off label uses 
additionally  the majority of states in which we market our products have similar anti kickback  false claims  anti fee splitting and self referral laws  imposing substantial penalties for violations 
to enforce compliance with the federal laws  the us department of justice doj has increased its scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers which has led to an unprecedented level of investigations and settlements in the healthcare industry 
dealing with investigations can be time and resource consuming 
additionally  if a healthcare company settles an investigation with the doj or other law enforcement agencies  the company may be forced to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement 
additionally  the commercial compliance environment is continually evolving in the healthcare industry as some states  including california and massachusetts  with more states following suit  mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs  along with the tracking and reporting of gifts  compensation  and other remuneration to physicians 
federal legislation  pursuant to the physician payments sunshine act of  has been proposed and is moving forward in congress 
this legislation would require public disclosure to the federal government of payments to physicians 
these requirements all provide for penalties for non compliance 
the shifting commercial compliance environment  along with the requirement to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and or reporting requirements  increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements 
international international sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations  which vary substantially from country to country 
the time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval  and the requirements may differ 
the european union  which consists of countries in europe  has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design  manufacture  clinical trials  labeling  and adverse event reporting for medical devices 
other countries  such as switzerland  have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the european union with respect to medical devices 
devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear ce conformity marking and  accordingly  can be commercially distributed throughout europe 
the method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product  but normally involves a combination of self assessment by the manufacturer and a third party assessment by a notified body 
this third party assessment consists of an audit of the manufacturer s quality system and technical review of the manufacturer s product 
we have now successfully passed several notified body audits since our original certification in  granting us iso registration and allowing the ce conformity marking to be applied to certain of our devices under 
table of contents the european union medical device directive 
we have expanded our certification scope and are now working with two different notified bodies overseeing our currently released  as well as forthcoming  product development projects 
third party reimbursement we expect that sales volumes and prices of our products will continue to be largely dependent on the availability of reimbursement from third party payers  such as governmental programs  for example  medicare and medicaid  private insurance plans and managed care programs 
these third party payers may deny reimbursement if they feel that a device is not the most cost effective treatment available  or was used for an unapproved indication 
also  third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
in international markets  reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines 
there can be no assurance that our products will be considered cost effective by third party payers  that reimbursement will be available or  if available  that the third party payers reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
particularly in the united states  third party payers carefully review  and increasingly challenge  the prices charged for procedures and medical products 
in addition  an increasing percentage of insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs  which monitor and often require pre approval of the services that a member will receive 
many managed care programs are paying their providers on a capitated basis  which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying them a predetermined payment per member per month 
the percentage of individuals covered by managed care programs is expected to grow in the united states over the next decade 
we believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to  and will continue to lead to  increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services 
there can be no assurance that third party reimbursement and coverage will be available or adequate  or that future legislation  regulation  or reimbursement policies of third party payers will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis 
the unavailability or inadequacy of third party payer coverage or reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
healthcare fraud and abuse healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to our business if a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed under medicare  medicaid or most other federally funded health care programs 
the federal anti kickback law prohibits unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally funded health care programs  such as remuneration provided to physicians to induce them to use certain tissue products or medical devices reimbursable by medicare or medicaid 
the anti kickback law is subject to evolving interpretations 
the majority of states also have anti kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions 
if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including  for example  exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by medicare or medicaid 
additionally  the civil false claims act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false  fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the us government 
actions under the false claims act may be brought by the attorney general or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government 
violations of the false claims act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages 
the federal government is using the false claims act  and the accompanying threat of significant liability  in its investigations of health care providers  suppliers and manufacturers throughout the country for a wide variety of medicare billing practices  and has obtained multi million and billion dollar settlements 
given the significant size of actual and potential settlements  it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating health care providers  suppliers  and manufacturers compliance with the health care billing  coverage and reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws

item a 
risk factors risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations and our future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
under these circumstances  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
further  additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business  operations  liquidity and stock price materially and adversely 
risks related to our business and industry pricing pressure from our competitors and sources of medical reimbursement may impact our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to expand our operations and reach profitability 
the market for spine surgery products is large and growing at a significant rate 
this has attracted numerous new companies and technologies  and encouraged more established companies to intensify competitive pressure 
new entrants to our markets include numerous niche companies with singular product focus  as well as companies owned partially by spine surgeons  who have significant market knowledge and access to the surgeons who use our products 
as a result of this increased competition  we believe there will be growing pricing pressure in the near future 
if competitive forces drive down the price we are able to charge for our products  our profit margins will shrink  which will hamper our ability to invest in and grow our business and achieve profitability 
further  sales of our products will depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payors 
healthcare providers  such as hospitals that purchase medical devices for treatment of their patients  generally rely on third party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with these devices 
spine surgeons are unlikely to use our products if they do not receive reimbursement adequate to cover the cost of their involvement in the surgical procedures 
we also believe that future reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions both in the united states and in international markets 
future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors may adversely affect the demand for our existing products or our products currently under development and limit our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 

table of contents to the extent we sell our products internationally  market acceptance may depend  in part  upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored healthcare and private insurance 
we are in a highly competitive market segment and face competition from large  well established medical device manufacturers as well as new market entrants 
the market for spine surgery products and procedures is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
with respect to neurovision  our nerve avoidance system  we compete with medtronic sofamor danek  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of medtronic  inc  and nicolet biomedical  a viasys healthcare company  both of which have significantly greater resources than we do  as well as numerous regional nerve monitoring companies 
with respect to maxcess  our minimally disruptive surgical system  our largest competitors are medtronic sofamor danek  inc  depuy spine  inc  a johnson johnson company  and synthes stratec  inc 
we compete with many of the same companies with respect to our other products 
we also compete with numerous smaller companies with respect to our implant products  many of whom have a significant regional market presence 
at any time  these companies may develop alternative treatments  products or procedures for the treatment of spine disorders that compete directly or indirectly with our products 
many of our larger competitors are either publicly traded or divisions or subsidiaries of publicly traded companies  and enjoy several competitive advantages over us  including significantly greater name recognition  established relations with a greater number of spine surgeons  hospitals  other healthcare providers and third party payors  larger and more well established distribution networks with significant international presence  products supported by long term clinical data  greater experience in obtaining and maintaining us food and drug administration  or fda  and other regulatory approvals or clearances for products and product enhancements  more expansive portfolios of intellectual property rights  and greater financial and other resources for product research and development  sales and marketing and litigation 
in addition  the spine industry is becoming increasingly crowded with new market entrants  including companies owned at least partially by spine surgeons 
many of these new competitors focus on a specific product or market segment  making it more difficult for us to expand our overall market position 
if these companies become successful  we expect that competition will become even more intense  leading to greater pricing pressure and making it more difficult for us to expand 
to be commercially successful  we must convince spine surgeons that our products are an attractive alternative to existing surgical treatments of spine disorders 
we believe spine surgeons may not widely adopt our products unless they determine  based on experience  clinical data and published peer reviewed journal articles  that our products provide benefits or an attractive alternative to conventional modalities of treating spine disorders 
surgeons may be slow to change their medical treatment practices for the following reasons  among others lack of experience with our products  lack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits  perceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures  
table of contents limited availability of reimbursement within healthcare payment systems  costs associated with the purchase of new products and equipment  and the time that must be dedicated for training 
in addition  we believe recommendations and support of our products by influential surgeons are essential for market acceptance and adoption 
if we do not receive support from such surgeons or have favorable long term data  surgeons and hospitals may not use our products 
in such circumstances  we may not achieve expected revenues and may never become profitable 
our future success depends on our ability to timely develop and introduce new products or product enhancements that will be accepted by the market 
it is important to our business that we continue to build a more complete product offering to surgeons and hospitals  and enhance the products we currently offer 
as such  our success will depend in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products to keep pace with the rapidly changing spine market 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for or market new products or that any of our future products or enhancements will be accepted by the surgeons who use our products or the payors who financially support many of the procedures performed with our products 
the success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on several factors  including our ability to properly identify and anticipate surgeon and patient needs  develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner  develop products based on technology that we acquire  such as the technology acquired from osiris therapeutics  inc  pearsalls limited and rsb spine llc  avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties  demonstrate  if required  the safety and efficacy of new products with data from preclinical studies and clinical trials  obtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements  provide adequate training to potential users of our products  receive adequate reimbursement  and develop an effective and dedicated marketing and distribution network 
if we do not develop new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements  our results of operations may suffer 
if our acquisitions are unsuccessful  our business may be harmed 
as part of our business strategy  we have acquired companies  technologies and product lines to maintain our objectives of developing or acquiring innovative technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following the possibility that we will pay more than the value we derive from the acquisition  which could result in future non cash impairment charges  difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  which may require significant attention of our management that otherwise would be available for the ongoing development of our business  the assumption of certain known and unknown liabilities of the acquired companies  and 
table of contents difficulties in retaining key relationships with employees  customers  partners and suppliers of the acquired company 
any of these factors could have a negative impact on our business  results of operations or financing position 
specifically  our recent osteocel acquisition is the largest acquisition we have ever completed  with a potential total acquisition price of million 
if we failed to properly value that business  or fail to generate expected revenues or profits from operation of that business  our results of operations will suffer 
additionally  our investment in progentix orthobiology bv  a private company working to develop a novel synthetic biologic  includes options and obligations to buy progentix orthobiology bv over time as development milestones are achieved 
if the progentix products are not commercially successful or unable to meet expected commercial success  but certain development milestones are achieved  we may be obligated to purchase progentix orthobiology bv at a price greater than the value of the company 
further  past and potential acquisitions entail risks  uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business  especially where we have little experience as a company developing or marketing a particular product or technology as is the case with the osteocel biologic product 
for example  we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired company s operations  technologies  products and services  information systems and personnel into our business  which will be required if we assume ownership of the osteocel processing facility 
acquisitions may also further strain our existing financial and managerial controls  and divert management s attention away from our other business concerns 
our reliance on single source suppliers could limit our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely manner or within our budget 
we rely on third party suppliers and manufacturers to manufacture and supply our products 
to be successful  our contract manufacturers must be able to provide us with products and components in substantial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements  in accordance with agreed upon specifications  at acceptable cost and on a timely basis 
our anticipated growth could strain the ability of suppliers to deliver an increasingly large supply of products  materials and components 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of high quality components to meet customer demand on a timely basis  we could lose customers  our reputation may be harmed and our business could suffer 
we currently use one or two manufacturers for each of our devices or components 
our dependence on one or two manufacturers involves several risks  including limited control over pricing  availability  quality and delivery schedules 
if any one or more of our manufacturers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of our components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us  or cease to manufacture components of acceptable quality  we would have to seek alternative sources of manufacturing 
we could incur delays while we locate and engage alternative qualified suppliers and we might be unable to engage alternative suppliers on favorable terms 
any such disruption or increased expenses could harm our commercialization efforts and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue 
invibio  inc is our exclusive supplier of polyetheretherketone  which comprises our peek partial vertebral body product called coroent 
we have a supply agreement with invibio  pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase our entire supply of polyetheretherketone for our current product lines from invibio 
we also have an exclusive supply arrangement with peak industries  inc  pursuant to which peak industries is our exclusive supplier of neurovision systems 
in the event we experience delays  shortages  or stoppages of supply with either supplier  we would be forced to locate a suitable alternative supplier which could take significant time and result in significant expense 
any inability to meet our customers demands for these products could lead to decreased sales  harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers to our competitors  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
maxigen biotech  inc  or mbi  is our exclusive supplier of our formagraft product 
we are party to a supply agreement with mbi  pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase our entire supply of formagraft from mbi 
we will require that mbi significantly expand its manufacturing capacity to meet our forecasted needs  and no assurance can be given that mbi will be able to meet our requirements 
if we experience difficulties in dealing with 
table of contents mbi we may not be able to secure an adequate source of supply of formagraft  which could adversely affect our operational results 
as part of the acquisition of the osteocel biologics business from osiris therapeutics  inc  osiris will act as our exclusive supplier of osteocel plus for a period of months from the close of the transaction 
in that capacity  we will be highly dependent on osiris for supply of osteocel plus and any failure on their part to process and supply such product will negatively impact our ability to meet projected sales and distribution of the product 
osteocel plus is processed from allograft  which is donated human tissue 
allograft is a supply constrained material and there is ongoing risk that there will be insufficient supply to produce the necessary quantity of osteocel plus 
allograft also carries with it the possibility of disease transmission  which could result in negative patient outcomes and negative publicity for our company 
further  tissue banks international  inc and allosource  inc 
collectively supply us with all of our allograft implants  and will continue to be our only sources for the foreseeable future 
the processing of human tissue into allograft implants is very labor intensive and it is therefore difficult to maintain a steady supply stream 
in addition  due to seasonal changes in mortality rates  some scarce tissues used for our allograft implants are at times in particularly short supply 
we cannot be certain that our supply of allograft implants from tissue banks international and allosource  inc will be available at current levels or will be sufficient to meet our needs 
if we are no longer able to obtain allograft implants from these sources in amounts sufficient to meet our needs  we may not be able to locate and engage replacement sources of allograft implants on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any interruption of our business caused by the need to locate additional sources of allograft implants could reduce our revenues 
we are dependent on the services of alexis v 
lukianov and keith valentine  and the loss of either of them could harm our business 
our continued success depends in part upon the continued service of alexis v 
lukianov  our chairman and chief executive officer  and keith valentine  our president and chief operating officer  who are critical to the overall management of nuvasive as well as to the development of our technology  our culture and our strategic direction 
we have entered into employment agreements with messrs 
lukianov and valentine  but neither of these agreements guarantees the service of the individual for a specified period of time 
the loss of either messr 
lukianov or valentine could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have not obtained and do not expect to obtain any key person life insurance policies 
if we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth  our business could suffer 
the rapid growth of our business has placed a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources and systems 
to execute our anticipated growth successfully  we must generate higher revenues to cover a higher level of operating expenses  and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control  attract and retain highly qualified management  scientific  manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel  assimilate new staff members and manage the complexities associated with a larger  faster growing and more geographically diverse organization  expand our clinical development resources to manage and execute increasingly global  larger and more complex clinical trials  expand our sales and marketing resources for international expansion and to launch an increasing number of new products from our product pipeline  accurately anticipate demand for the products we manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing capacity for both commercial and clinical supply while maintaining quality standards  and 
table of contents upgrade our internal business processes and capabilities eg  information technology platform and systems  product distribution and tracking to create the scalability that a growing business demands 
we completed the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning  or erp  software system in to support our increasingly complex business and business processes 
after the initial implementation  we determined that additional consulting time was important for a successful transition and therefore incurred incremental expenses related to the on going support costs for the implementation 
these investments minimize the potential for transitional risk of moving to the new erp system and will assist in driving expected efficiencies in we expect to move to a more traditional and leverageable on going support model in  without significant incremental costs 
further  our anticipated growth  both internationally and domestically  will place additional strain on our suppliers and manufacturers  resulting in increased need for us to carefully monitor quality assurance 
any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals 
additionally  as the number of products we offer grows  it will become more difficult for our sales force to focus on selling each product and  thereby  possibly limiting the sales potential of certain products 
if clinical trials of our current or future product candidates do not produce results necessary to support regulatory approval in the united states  we will be unable to commercialize these products 
several investigational devices in our development pipeline  including our neodisc cervical disc replacement device  cerpass cervical total disc replacement  or tdr  and lateral tdr  will require premarket approval  or pma  from the fda 
a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the less rigorous k process 
a pma application must be supported by extensive data including  but not limited to  technical  preclinical  clinical trials  manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fda s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 
as a result  to receive regulatory approval for neodisc  cerpass or other devices requiring pma approval  we must conduct  at our own expense  adequate and well controlled clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and safety in humans 
clinical testing is expensive  takes many years and has an uncertain outcome 
clinical failure can occur at any stage of the testing 
our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results  and we may decide  or regulators may require us  to conduct additional clinical and or non clinical testing 
our failure to adequately demonstrate the efficacy and safety of any of our devices would prevent receipt of regulatory approval and  ultimately  the commercialization of that device 
our neodisc device is currently the subject of an investigational device exemption clinical study 
we have fully enrolled this clinical study and are in the follow up period 
data is being collected from patients in the clinical study  and we will rely on that data to determine whether the device is safe and effective 
there is no assurance that the neodisc device will be approved for sale in the united states by the fda 
the clinical study may prove that the device does not provide the intended benefit or that there are unintended negative side effects of the device that make it unsafe or not effective 
in addition  the neodisc device includes embroidery technology  which has not been thoroughly studied for use as permanent implants in the spine 
any failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval for neodisc will hamper our ability to commercialize the device in the united states 
if we fail to obtain  or experience significant delays in obtaining  fda clearances or approvals for our future products or product enhancements  our ability to commercially distribute and market our products could suffer 
our medical devices are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal  state and foreign governmental authorities 
the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device  particularly from the fda  can be costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that such clearances or approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
in particular  the fda permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received clearance under section k of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or is the subject of an approved premarket approval application  or pma 
the fda 
table of contents will clear marketing of a medical device through the k process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to other k cleared products 
the pma process is more costly  lengthy and uncertain than the k clearance process 
additionally  any modification to a k cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance or  possibly  premarket approval 
the fda may not agree with any of our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary 
our failure to comply with such regulations could lead to the imposition of injunctions  suspensions or loss of regulatory approvals  product recalls  termination of distribution  or product seizures 
in the most egregious cases  criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 
pursuant to fda regulations  we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses 
if the fda determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use  it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions  including the issuance of a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine and criminal penalties 
it is also possible that other federal  state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use  which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities 
foreign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and  to the extent we market and sell our products in foreign countries  we may be subject to rigorous regulation in the future 
in such circumstances  we would rely significantly on our foreign independent sales agencies to comply with the varying regulations  and any failures on their part could result in restrictions on the sale of our products in foreign countries 
the safety of our products is not yet supported by long term clinical data and our products may therefore prove to be less safe and effective than initially thought 
we obtained clearance to offer almost all of our products that require fda clearance or approval through the fda s k clearance process 
the fda s k clearance process is less rigorous than the pma process and requires less supporting clinical data 
as a result  we currently lack the breadth of published long term clinical data supporting the safety of our products and the benefits they offer that might have been generated in connection with the pma process 
for these reasons  spine surgeons may be slow to adopt our products  we may not have comparative data that our competitors have or are generating and we may be subject to greater regulatory and product liability risks 
further  future patient studies or clinical experience may indicate that treatment with our products does not improve patient outcomes 
such results would reduce demand for our products  significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected revenues and could prevent us from becoming profitable 
moreover  if future results and experience indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects  we could be subject to significant legal liability and harm to our business reputation 
the spine medical device market has been particularly prone to costly product liability litigation 
if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the fda s quality system regulations  the manufacture of our products could be delayed and we may be subject to an enforcement action by the fda 
we and our suppliers are required to comply with the fda s quality system regulations  which cover the methods and documentation of the design  testing  production  control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging  storage and shipping of our products 
the fda enforces the quality system regulation through inspections 
if we or one of our suppliers fail a quality system regulations inspection or if any corrective action plan is not sufficient  the manufacture of our products could be delayed 
we underwent an fda inspection in april regarding our allograft implant business and another fda inspection in june regarding our medical device activities 
in connection with these inspections as well as prior inspections  the fda requested minor corrective actions  which we have taken to satisfy the corrective actions 
there can be no assurance the fda will not subject us to further enforcement action and the fda may impose additional inspections at any time 
additionally  we are the legal manufacturer of record for the products that are distributed and labeled by nuvasive  regardless of whether the products are manufactured by us or our suppliers 
thus  a failure by us or our 
table of contents suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda  which may include any of the following sanctions fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing our request for k clearance or premarket approval of new products  withdrawing k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted  and criminal prosecution 
risks related to our financial results and need for financing we have always incurred losses and have incurred significant total operating losses since our inception  and we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability or that  if profitability is achieved  that we will be able to sustain profitability 
since our inception in  we have yet to generate ongoing sufficient sales of our products to achieve profits on an annual basis or to become profitable overall 
our net loss for the twelve months ended december  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the twelve months ended december  at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million  and cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments totaling approximately million 
even if we do achieve profitability as planned  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on an ongoing basis 
the recent financial crisis and general slowdown of the economy may adversely affect our liquidity and the liquidity of our customers 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in investments in marketable securities 
we have historically invested these amounts in us treasuries and government agencies  corporate debt  money market funds  commercial paper and municipal bonds meeting certain criteria 
certain of these investments are subject to general credit  liquidity and other market risks 
the general condition of the financial markets and the economy has exacerbated those risks and may affect the value of our current investments and restrict our ability to access the capital markets 
due to the continued downward yield trends on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  our net interest income has progressively been reduced and  in the fourth quarter of  it resulted in a net interest expense position 
as our effective yield from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities is lower than our coupon rate  we will likely continue to record interest expense  net  through if there are further declines in the yield of our investment portfolio and we are unable to find alternative sources of liquidity  our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition may be adversely affected 
the liquidity of our customers and suppliers may also be affected by the current financial crisis 
if our suppliers experience credit or liquidity problems important sources of raw materials or manufactured goods may be affected 
if our customers liquidity and creditworthiness is negatively impacted by the current financial crisis and the condition of the economy  our ability to collect on our outstanding invoices and our collection cycles may be adversely affected 
our quarterly financial results are likely to fluctuate significantly because our sales prospects are uncertain 
our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period  particularly because our sales prospects are uncertain 
these fluctuations may also affect our annual operating results and may cause those results to fluctuate unexpectedly from year to year 
the level of our revenues and results of operations at any given time will be based primarily on the following factors our ability to increase sales of our products to hospitals and surgeons  
table of contents our ability to expand and maintain an effective and dedicated sales force  pricing pressure applicable to our products  including adverse third party reimbursement outcomes  results of clinical research and trials on our existing products and products in development and our ability to obtain fda approval or clearance  the mix of our products sold ie  profit margins differ between our products  timing of new product launches  acquisitions  licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors  the ability of our suppliers to timely provide us with an adequate supply of materials and components and meet our quality requirements  the evolving product offerings of our competitors and the potential introduction of new and competing technologies  regulatory approvals and legislative and reimbursement policy changes affecting the products we may offer or those of our competitors  and interruption in the manufacturing or distribution of our products 
many of the products we may seek to develop and introduce in the future will require fda approval or clearance  without which we cannot begin to commercialize them in the united states  and commercialization of them outside of the united states would likely require other regulatory approvals and import licenses 
as a result  it will be difficult for us to forecast demand for these products with any degree of certainty 
in addition  we will be increasing our operating expenses as we build our commercial capabilities 
accordingly  we may experience significant  unanticipated quarterly losses 
because of these factors  our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
we may not be able to sublease our former headquarters or receive rental income on any such sublease to cover our lease obligations 
we completed our relocation to the new facility  which serves as our current headquarters  in the third quarter of subsequent to the relocation  we have attempted to sublease our former facility through august  the date on which the related lease agreement expires 
we have encountered and may continue to encounter significant difficulties or delays in subleasing our current headquarters and may not be able to sublease it for rents equal to or greater than those which we are obligated to pay 
to date  we have incurred an additional million in operating expenses for continued difficulty in subleasing our former headquarters will cause us to incur further increases in operating expenses  which could cause us to exceed our planned expense levels and adversely affect our financial results 
furthermore  inability to sublease such facility may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
upon the achievement of certain milestones related to our acquisitions  we may be required to make payments which may affect our liquidity and our financial results 
in connection with our recent acquisitions  we may be obligated to make payments in the future upon the achievement of certain milestones 
the likelihood of those milestones being achieved and the timing of such payments are uncertain and are subject to change over time 
if we are required to make those payments  particularly at a time when we are experiencing financial difficulty  our liquidity  financial results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

table of contents risks related to our intellectual property and potential litigation we are currently involved in a patent litigation action involving medtronic and  if we do not prevail in this action  we could be liable for past damages and might be prevented from making  using  selling  offering to sell  importing or exporting certain of our products 
on august   medtronic sofamor danek usa  inc and its related entities medtronic filed suit against nuvasive in the united states district court for the southern district of california  alleging that certain of our products infringe  or contribute to the infringement of  us patents owned by medtronic 
medtronic is a large  publicly traded corporation with significantly greater financial resources than us 
intellectual property litigation is expensive  complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict 
we may also be subject to negative publicity due to the litigation 
pending or future patent litigation against us or any strategic partners or licensees may force us or any strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party s intellectual property  unless that party grants us or any strategic partners or licensees rights to use its intellectual property  and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel 
in the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged  and if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such cases  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products 
however  we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms  or at all and any licenses may require substantial royalties or other payments by us 
even if any strategic partners  licensees or we were able to obtain rights to the third party s intellectual property  these rights may be non exclusive  thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
furthermore  if we are found to infringe patent claims of a third party  we may  among other things  be required to pay damages  including up to treble damages and attorney s fees and costs  which may be substantial 
an unfavorable outcome for us in this patent litigation could significantly harm our business if such outcome makes us unable to commercialize some of our current or potential products or cease some of our business operations 
in addition  costs of defense and any damages resulting from the litigation may materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
the litigation may also harm our relationships with existing customers and subject us to negative publicity  each of which could harm our business and financial results 
our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  and nondisclosure  confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
for example  our pending us and foreign patent applications may not issue as patents in a form that will be advantageous to us or may issue and be subsequently successfully challenged by others and invalidated 
in addition  our pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of our products and procedures that are not currently protected by issued patents 
both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive 
competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products which provide outcomes which are comparable to ours 
although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology  including entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our officers  shareowners  consultants and advisors  such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in addition  there are numerous proposed changes to the patent laws and rules of the us patent and trademark office which  if enacted  may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our 
table of contents intellectual property rights 
for example  proposed changes to the patent rules of the us patent and trademark office were scheduled to take effect on november  which would have significantly limited the right to pursue continuation applications 
on october   a temporary injunction was granted in a lawsuit against the us patent and trademark office which served to stay the application of the proposed rules 
the us court of appeals for the federal circuit heard argument on the appeal of the case in early december  and is expected to rule in the coming months 
if the injunction is lifted  the proposed rules may take effect and may adversely impact our ability to prevent others from designing around our existing patents 
moreover  congress is considering several significant changes to the us patent laws  including among other things changing from a first to invent to a first inventor to file system  limiting the for a where a patentee may file a patent suit  requiring the apportionment of patent damages  and creating a post grant opposition process to challenge patents after they have issued 
in the event a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights  enforcing those rights may be costly  difficult and time consuming 
even if successful  litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and time consuming and could divert our management s attention 
we may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge 
in addition  certain product categories  including pedicle screws  have been the subject of significant patent litigation in recent years 
since we sell pedicle screws and recently introduced our spherx ii pedicle screw system  any related litigation could harm our business 
the medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
it is not unusual for parties to exchange letters surrounding allegations of intellectual property infringement and licensing arrangements 
patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain 
any claim relating to infringement of patents that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages  including treble damages in some cases 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
our success will also depend in part on our not infringing patents issued to others  including our competitors and potential competitors 
if our products are found to infringe the patents of others  our development  manufacture and sale of such potential products could be severely restricted or prohibited 
in addition  our competitors may independently develop technologies similar to ours 
because of the importance of our patent portfolio to our business  we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
as the number of entrants into our market increases  the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us grows 
while we make an effort to ensure that our products do not infringe other parties patents and proprietary rights  our products and methods may be covered by patents held by our competitors 
in addition  our competitors may assert that future products we may market infringe their patents 
a patent infringement suit brought against us or any of our strategic partners or licensees may force us or such strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party s intellectual property  unless that party grants us or our strategic partners or licensees rights to use its intellectual property 
in such cases  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products 
however  we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms  or at all and any licenses may require substantial royalties or other payments by us 
even if our strategic partners  licensees or we were able to obtain rights to the third party s intellectual property  these rights may be non exclusive  thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims  which could severely harm our business 
if we become subject to product liability claims  we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing  manufacture and sale of medical devices for spine surgery procedures 
spine surgery involves significant risk of serious 
table of contents complications  including bleeding  nerve injury  paralysis and even death 
in addition  we sell allograft implants  derived from cadaver bones  which pose the potential risk of biological contamination 
if any such contamination is found to exist  sales of allograft products could decline and our reputation would be harmed 
currently  we maintain product liability insurance in the amount of million 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future 
in addition  if our product liability insurance proves to be inadequate to pay a damage award  we may have to pay the excess out of our cash reserves which may harm our financial condition 
if longer term patient results and experience indicate that our products or any component cause tissue damage  motor impairment or other adverse effects  we could be subject to significant liability 
finally  even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could harm our reputation in the industry  lead to significant legal fees and could result in the diversion of management s attention from managing our business 
any claims relating to our making improper payments to physicians for consulting services  or other potential violations of regulations governing interactions between us and healthcare providers  could be time consuming and costly 
our relationship with surgeons  hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal anti kickback  self referral  false claims and similar laws  often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws 
healthcare fraud and abuse laws are complex  and even minor  inadvertent violations can potentially give rise to claims that the relevant law has been violated 
any violations of these laws could result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock  as well as our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that any of the healthcare fraud and abuse laws will not change or be interpreted in the future in a manner which restricts or adversely affects our business activities or relationships with surgeons  hospitals and marketers of our products 
federal anti kickback laws and regulations prohibit any knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration by an individual or entity in return for  or to induce the referral of an individual for a service or product for which payment may be made by medicare  medicaid or other government sponsored healthcare program  or purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for any service or product for which payment may be made by a government sponsored healthcare program 
possible sanctions for violation of these anti kickback laws include monetary fines  civil and criminal penalties  exclusion from medicare and medicaid programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions 
in  several medical device manufacturers entered into deferred prosecution agreements with the federal government and paid over million  in aggregate  to the government over allegations that the companies had paid kickbacks to surgeons to reward and incentivize use of their surgical implant products 
additionally  the majority of states in which we market our products have similar anti kickback  anti fee splitting and self referral laws  imposing substantial penalties for violations 
in addition to the anti kickback law  federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to get a false claim paid 
examples of enforcement under this law include the prosecution of several pharmaceutical and device companies for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product 
other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company s marketing of the product for unapproved  and thus non reimbursable  uses 
pursuant to fda regulations  we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses 
although surgeons are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the fda based on their medical judgment  we are prohibited from promoting products for such off label uses 
we market our products and provide promotional materials and training programs to surgeons regarding the use of our products 
although we believe our marketing  promotional materials and training programs for surgeons do not constitute promotion of unapproved uses of our products  if it is determined that our marketing  promotional materials or training programs constitute promotion of unapproved uses  we could be subject to significant fines in 
table of contents addition to regulatory enforcement actions  including the issuance of a warning letter  injunction  seizure and criminal penalty 
to enforce compliance with federal laws  the us department of justice  or doj  has increased its scrutiny of the interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers  which has led to an unprecedented level of investigations and settlements in the healthcare industry 
dealing with doj investigations can be time and resource consuming 
additionally  if a healthcare company settles an investigation with the doj  or other law enforcement agencies  we may be forced to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement 
further  the commercial compliance environment is continually evolving in the healthcare industry with certain states mandating implementation of commercial compliance programs and disclosure requirements while similar legislation has been proposed on the federal level 
we must comply with a variety of other laws  such as the healthcare insurance portability and accountability act of  which protects the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information  and the federal trade commission act and similar laws regulating advertisement and consumer protections 
the scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change  especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations 
there can be no assurance that federal or state regulatory authorities will not challenge or investigate our current or future activities under these laws 
any such challenge or investigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any state or federal regulatory review of us  regardless of the outcome  would be costly and time consuming 
additionally  we cannot predict the impact of any changes in these laws  whether or not retroactive 
we or our suppliers may be the subject of claims for non compliance with fda regulations in connection with the processing or distribution of allograft products 
it is possible that allegations may be made against us or against donor recovery groups or tissue banks  including those with which we have a contractual relationship  claiming that the acquisition or processing of tissue for allograft products does not comply with applicable fda regulations or other relevant statutes and regulations 
allegations like these could cause regulators or other authorities to take investigative or other action against us  or could cause negative publicity for us or our industry generally 
these actions or any negative publicity could cause us to incur substantial costs  divert the attention of our management from our business  harm our reputation and cause the market price of our shares to decline 
risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock we expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially  potentially adversely affecting the ability of investors to sell their shares 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors  including general market conditions and other factors such as the effect the recent financial crisis is having on stock markets as a whole  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors  volume and timing of orders for our products  the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  disputes or other developments with respect to intellectual property rights or other potential legal actions  our ability to develop  obtain regulatory clearance or approval for  and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis  quarterly variations in our or our competitor s results of operations  sales of large blocks of our common stock  including sales by our executive officers and directors  announcements of technological or medical innovations for the treatment of spine pathology  changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals  clearances or applications  
table of contents changes in the availability of third party reimbursement in the united states or other countries  the acquisition or divestiture of businesses  products  assets or technology  litigation  including intellectual property litigation  announcements of actions by the fda or other regulatory agencies  and changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts 
market price fluctuations may negatively affect the ability of investors to sell our shares at consistent prices 
anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders  which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable 
some of these provisions authorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval  with rights senior to those of the common stock  provide for a classified board of directors  with each director serving a staggered three year term  prohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies  calling special stockholder meetings  or taking action by written consent  prohibit our stockholders from making certain changes to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws except with stockholder approval  and require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations

overview we are a medical device company focused on the design  development and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders 
our currently marketed product portfolio is focused on applications for spine fusion surgery  a market estimated to exceed billion in the united states in our principal product offering includes a minimally disruptive surgical platform called maximum access surgery  or mas  as well as a growing offering of biologics  cervical and motion preservation products 
our currently marketed products are used predominantly in spine fusion surgeries  both to enable access to the spine and to perform restorative and fusion procedures 
we focus significant research and development efforts to expand our mas product platform  advance the applications of our unique technology to additional procedures and develop motion preserving products such as total disc replacement and nucleus like cervical disc replacement 
we dedicate significant resources to our sales and marketing efforts  including training spine surgeons on our unique technology and products 
our mas platform combines four categories of our product offerings neurovision a proprietary software driven nerve avoidance system  maxcess a unique split blade design retraction system providing enhanced surgical access to the spine  biologics includes our formagraft and osteocel line of products  and specialized implants including our spherx pedicle screw system and coroent suite of implants 

table of contents our mas platform  with the unique advantages provided by neurovision  enables an innovative lateral procedure known as extreme lateral interbody fusion  or xlif  in which surgeons access the spine for a fusion procedure from the side of the patient s body  rather than from the front or back 
our maxcess instruments provide access to the spine in a manner that affords direct visibility and our neurovision system allows surgeons to avoid critical nerves 
in recent years we have significantly expanded our product offering relating to procedures in the cervical spine as well as the area of biologics 
our cervical product offering now provides a full set of solutions for cervical fusion surgery  including both allograft and coroent implants  as well as cervical plating and posterior fixation products 
our biologic offering began in with the acquisition of rights to formagraft  a collagen synthetic product used to aid the fusion process 
this offering expanded in with the acquisition of osteocel from osiris therapeutics  an allograft cellular matrix containing viable mesenchymal stem cells to aid in spinal fusion 
we also offer a suite of traditional spine surgery products  including certain products in our coroent suite of implants  a titanium surgical mesh system  a line of precision machined cervical and lumbar allograft implants  and related instrumentation 
our triad and extensure tm lines of bone allograft  in our patented saline packaging  is human bone that has been processed and precision shaped for transplant 
we also offer fusion fixation products that offer unique technological benefits such as our gradient plus tm cervical plate and spherx pedicle screw system 
we have an active product development pipeline focused on expanding our current fusion product platform as well as products designed to preserve spinal motion 
in particular  we have a pivotal clinical study underway with respect to our neodisc cervical disc replacement device and are actively seeking to initiate clinical trials with other potential products 
since inception  we have been unprofitable 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
revenues 
the majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of disposables and implants and we expect this trend to continue in the near term 
we loan our surgical instrument sets  including our neurovision systems  at no cost to surgeons and hospitals that purchase disposables and implants for use in individual procedures  there are no minimum purchase requirements of disposables and implants related to these loaned surgical instruments 
in addition  we place neurovision  maxcess and other mas surgical instrument sets with hospitals for an extended period at no up front cost to them provided they commit to minimum monthly purchases of disposables and implants 
these extended loan transactions represent approximately of our total stock of loaner surgical assets 
our implants and disposables are currently sold and shipped primarily from our memphis facility or from limited disposable inventories stored at our independent sales agents sites 
we recognize revenue for disposables or implants used upon receiving a purchase order from the hospital indicating product use or implantation 
additionally  we sell a small number of mas instrument sets  maxcess devices  and neurovision systems 
to date  we have derived less than of our total revenues from these sales 
sales and marketing 
through  substantially all of our operations are located in the united states and substantially all of our sales to date have been generated in the united states 
we sell our products through a sales force comprised of exclusive independent sales agencies and our own directly employed sales professionals  both selling only nuvasive spine surgery products 
our sales force provides a delivery and consultative service to our surgeon and hospital customers and is compensated based on sales and product placements in their territories 
sales force commissions are reflected in our statement of operations in the sales  marketing and administrative expense line 
we expect to continue to expand our distribution channel 
beginning late in and continuing today  we are continuing our expansion in international sales efforts with the initial focus on european markets 
we expect our international sales force to be made up of a combination of distributors and direct sales personnel 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we 
table of contents evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts  inventories  valuation of goodwill  intangibles and other long term assets  income taxes  and stock compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines for the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payment and customer acceptance 
we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
specifically  revenue from the sale of implants and disposables is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order from the hospital indicating product use or implantation or upon shipment to third party customers who immediately accept title 
revenue from the sale of our instrument sets is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order and the subsequent shipment to customers who immediately accept title 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and is estimated based on the aging of account balances  collection history and known trends with current customers and in the economy in general 
as a result of this review  the allowance is adjusted on a specific identification basis 
an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts results in a corresponding charge to sales  marketing and administrative expense 
we maintain a relatively large customer base that mitigates the risk of concentration with one customer 
however  if the overall condition of the healthcare industry were to deteriorate  or if the historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not accurately reflect our customer s future failure to pay outstanding receivables  significant additional allowances could be required 
excess and obsolete inventory and instruments 
we provide an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence and excess inventory based upon historical turnover and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
our allograft products have shelf lives ranging from two to four years and are subject to demand fluctuations based on the availability and demand for alternative products 
our inventory  which consists primarily of disposables and specialized implants  is at risk of obsolescence following the introduction and development of new or enhanced products 
our estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
increases in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding charge to cost of goods sold 
a stated goal of our business is to focus on continual product innovation and to obsolete our own products 
while we believe this provides a competitive edge  it also results in the risk that our products and related capital instruments will become obsolete prior to sale or to the end of their anticipated useful lives 
if we introduce new products or next generation products  we may be required to dispose of existing inventory and related capital instruments prior to the end of their estimated useful life and or write off the value or accelerate the depreciation of the these assets 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of december  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
interest and penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense 

table of contents valuation of stock based compensation 
we apply the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas revised  share based payments sfas r  which established accounting for share based awards exchanged for shareowner employee and non employee director services and requires us to expense the estimated fair value of these awards over the requisite service period 
option awards issued to non employees excluding non employee directors are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services  and are periodically revalued as the options vest and are recognized as expense over the related service period 
for purposes of calculating stock based compensation  we estimate the fair value of stock options and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  the black scholes option pricing model incorporates various and highly sensitive assumptions including expected volatility  expected term and interest rates 
stock based compensation related to stock options is recognized and amortized on an accelerated basis in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option award plans fin 
if there is a difference between the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation expense and the actual factors which become known over time  specifically with respect to anticipated forfeitures  we may change the input factors used in determining stock based compensation costs for future grants 
these changes  if any  may materially impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made 
valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
our goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from our business combinations 
our intangible assets are comprised primarily of acquired technology  manufacturing know how  licensed technology  supply agreements and trade names and trademarks 
we make significant judgments in relation to the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets resulting from business combinations and asset acquisitions 
the determination of the value of goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations and asset acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
goodwill is not amortized 
the value and useful lives assigned to other acquired intangible assets impact future amortization  and the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires that goodwill and intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis or more frequently if facts and circumstance warrant such a review 
for purposes of assessing the impairment of goodwill  the company estimates the value of the reporting unit using its market capitalization as the best evidence of fair value 
the company determined that it is a single reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment tests under sfas if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
we performed our annual test of goodwill during the fourth quarter of  and have determined there has been no impairment of goodwill through december  we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  trademarks and trade names  customer relationships and agreements  manufacturing know how and other intangibles and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of two to years 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period  we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse 
table of contents effect on our reported financial results 
we have not recognized any impairment charges on our intangible assets through december  as of december   the net carrying amount of our intangible assets was million 
property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of three to seven years for machinery and equipment and three years for loaner instruments 
we own land and a building in memphis  tennessee that we use as a warehouse and distribution facility 
the building is being depreciated over a period of years 
maintenance and repairs on all property and equipment are expensed as incurred 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap 
see our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
results of operations revenue year ended december  to to change change change change revenue revenues have increased over time due primarily to continued market acceptance of our products within our mas platform  including neurovision and maxcess disposables  and our specialized implants such as our xlp tm lateral plate  spherx pedicle screw systems  and coroent suite of products 
the continued adoption of minimally invasive procedures for spine has led to the continued expansion of our innovative lateral procedure known as extreme lateral interbody fusion  or xlif  in which surgeons access the spine for a fusion procedure from the side of the patient s body  rather than from the front or back 
the execution of our strategy of expanding our product offering for the lumbar region and addressing broader indications further up the spine in the thoracic and cervical regions through product introductions in and has contributed to revenue growth in each year 
we expect revenue to continue to increase  which can be attributed to the continued adoption of our xlif procedure and deeper penetration into existing accounts as our sales force executes on the strategy of selling the full mix of our products 
in addition  the expansion of our biologics offering  including formagraft  acquired in january  and osteocel  acquired in july  and our new product introductions and strategic business and asset acquisitions are expected to lead to continued revenue growth 
cost of goods sold year ended december  to to change change change change cost of goods sold of total revenue cost of goods sold consists of costs of purchased goods and depreciation expense for surgical instrument sets 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue has decreased over time due to i a higher portion of our sales coming from products with higher margins and ii efficiencies gained with growth and volume 
the year over year increase in cost of goods sold in total dollars in compared to and in compared to resulted primarily from i increased material costs of million and million  respectively  associated with the higher revenue in each year  as well as million in costs related to sales of the osteocel product in  and ii increased depreciation expense of million and million  respectively  due to higher capital levels of surgical instrument sets used in surgeries 
we expect cost of goods sold  as a percentage of revenue  to remain relatively consistent for the foreseeable future 
consistent with our philosophy of obsoleting our own products  we have launched several new products and enhancements over the last few years 
in connection with the product launches  certain instruments and implants 
table of contents were rendered obsolete 
as a result  we incurred an additional   and  in  and  respectively  of expense related to inventory and instruments rendered obsolete 
this expense is included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the respective years 
operating expenses sales  marketing and administrative year ended december  to to change change change change sales  marketing and administrative of total revenue sales  marketing and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  commission and training costs for personnel engaged in sales  marketing and customer support functions  distributor commissions  surgeon training costs  shareowner employee related expenses for our administrative functions  third party professional service fees  amortization of acquired intangible assets  and facilities and insurance expenses 
the increases in sales  marketing and administrative expenses principally result from growth in our revenue and the overall growth of the company  including expenses that fluctuate with sales and expenses associated with investments in our infrastructure and headcount growth 
increases in costs based on revenue  such as sales force compensation and other direct costs related to the sales force  royalty expense  and shipping costs were million  million  and million in  and  respectively  compared to the prior years 
the increases are consistent with our increased revenue growth of approximately in as compared to and an overall increase in sales force headcount of approximately 
total costs related to our sales force  as a percent of revenue  were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in costs as a percentage of revenue from to was primarily attributable to certain costs associated with our transition to sales force exclusivity that were incurred in the but not incurred in or we also experienced increased costs as a result of overall company growth and headcount additions in our marketing and administrative support functions  as well as costs related to the implementation of our new erp system 
marketing and administrative compensation and personnel costs increased million and million in and  respectively  compared to the prior years 
our marketing and administrative headcount increased over during stock based compensation increased million and million in and  respectively  compared to the prior years  primarily as a result of grants to new shareowners employees and valuation related changes for all options granted in  most significantly  the market value of our common stock 
facility  equipment and computer expenses increased by million and million in and  respectively  compared to the prior years  primarily as a result of the move to our new corporate headquarters  as discussed below 
we incurred other significant expenses in that are designed to increase the scalability of our business over time 
we completed the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning  or erp  software system in we incurred a total of million in costs related to the erp project through june which has been capitalized 
we are amortizing the capitalized costs over a year period beginning in july during the third quarter  we determined that additional consulting time was important for a successful transition and therefore incurred million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of which were incremental non capitalizable expenses related to the on going support costs for the implementation 
these third and fourth quarter investments minimize the potential for transitional risk of moving to the new erp system and will assist in driving expected efficiencies in the total non capitalizable costs of million are included in sales  marketing and administrative expense in we expect to move to a more traditional and leverage able on going support model in  without significant incremental costs 
in addition  we entered into a lease of a two building campus style headquarters complex in november to accommodate our continued growth 
the relocation process to the new facility was achieved in stages that began in march and completed in august as a result  we began to incur increased facility costs beginning in 
table of contents march specifically  we incurred approximately million in incremental facility costs in  including move related costs  plus a charge of million related to vacating our previous corporate headquarters  as discussed below 
we expect to be able to sublease our previous corporate headquarters through august  the date on which our related lease agreement expires  however  we also expect that the space will remain vacant for approximately an additional months from december  with no associated sublease income during that time 
at the completion of moving the final phase of shareowners employees and operations from our previous facility to our new headquarters during august  we recorded a loss equal to the present value of expected net future cash flows in the amount of million 
for purposes of estimating the loss on the lease  management has estimated  based on market conditions  that the facility would remain vacant for approximately months beginning in september as of the date of this filing  we have not yet entered into a sublease agreement and cannot be assured that a sublease  if any  will provide the anticipated sublease income used to estimate the charge recorded 
on a long term basis  as a percentage of revenue  we expect total sales  marketing and administrative costs to continue to decrease over time as we continue to see the synergies of investments we have made 
research and development year ended december  to to change change change change research and development of total revenue research and development expense consists primarily of product research and development  clinical trial costs  regulatory and clinical functions  and the related shareowner employee expenses 
in the last several years  we have introduced numerous new products and product enhancements that have significantly expanded our mas platform  enhanced the applications of the xlif procedure  expanded our offering of cervical products  and marked our entrance into the growing motion preservation market 
we have also acquired complementary and strategic assets and technology  particularly in the area of biologics 
in the third quarter of  we commenced patient enrollment in our neodisc clinical trial  resulting in increased research and development costs subsequent to this date 
enrollment in the neodisc clinical trial was completed in august the trial protocol requires a two year follow up period on all patients before submitting to the us food and drug administration  or fda  for potential approval 
the year over year increases in research and development costs in compared to and in compared to are primarily due to i increases in compensation and other shareowner related expenses of million and million in and  respectively  primarily due to increased headcount to support our product development and enhancement efforts  and ii decreased neodisc trial costs of million in compared to due to the trial becoming fully enrolled during august  and an increase of million in neodisc trial costs in compared to we expect research and development costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future in support of our ongoing development activities and planned clinical trial activities

we account for this investment at cost and is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
these transactions and their impact to our consolidated statement of position and results of operations are fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in process research and development in process research and development ipr d expense is comprised of in process technologies of million and million associated with the acquisition of the osteocel biologics business in the third quarter of and our acquisition of the pedicle screw technology during the first quarter of  respectively  as described in more detail below 
at the date of each acquisition  the projects associated with the ipr d efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date 
valuation of ipr d 
the value assigned to acquired in process technology is determined by identifying products under research in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established at the acquisition date 
the value of the in process technology was determined using a discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach  focusing on the income producing capabilities of the in process technologies 
under this approach  the value is determined by estimating the revenue contribution generated by each of the identified technologies 
revenue estimates were based on i individual product revenues  ii anticipated growth rates  iii anticipated product development and introduction schedules  iv product sales cycles  and v the estimated life of a product s underlying technology 
from the revenue estimates  operating expense estimates  including costs of sales  marketing  general and administrative  and income taxes  were deducted to arrive at operating income 
revenue growth rates were estimated by management for the product and gave consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected industry trends  the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of the product s underlying technology 
operating expense estimates reflect nuvasive s historical expense ratios 
additionally  these projects will require continued research and development after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility 
the resulting operating income stream was discounted to reflect its present value at the date of acquisition 
the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased in process technology is our weighted average cost of capital wacc  taking into account our required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise and reflecting the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  if any  and the uncertainty of technological advances  all of which are unknown at this time 
osteocel bioglogics business 
on july   we completed the acquisition of the osteocel biologics business from osiris therapeutics  inc the ipr d expense related to this acquisition was million and consisted of four primary projects in process at the time of the acquisition a revised formulation of the current osteocel plus based upon various potential changes to the manufacturing processes and donor composition  a putty formulation  a version combined with a synthetic carrier  and osteceol xc  the next generation cultured version of 
table of contents the product for which we received rights to acquire 
we expect completion of these projects to begin in approximately two years and continue over a period of approximately ten years 
each of these projects will build upon the existing osteocel family of research and development  or r d  and related intellectual property 
all four projects are in the early conceptual phase and have significant development and regulatory risk  making the specific launch dates difficult to predict 
we have attempted to predict the timing of these inputs  estimated impact on cannibalization and revenue growth 
the value of each potential product line extension s ipr d value was based upon the r d status  forward revenue and related r d expense estimates at the time of acquisition 
pedicle screw technology 
in march  we acquired new pedicle screw intellectual property totaling million 
the total purchase price of million was allocated to in process research and development  and consisted of three primary projects in process at the time of acquisition dbr ii pedicle screw system  posted pedicle screw system  or pps  and deformity system 
these projects will incorporate different facets of the design features of the technology acquired 
the value of each potential project s ipr d value was based upon the status  forward revenue and related r d expense estimates at the time of acquisition  including headcount for engineering time going forward  as well as materials to be utilized for manufacture and testing 
the three acquired projects were brought through the development processes through and are expected to be completed at different phases throughout  beginning in approximately the second quarter 
pearsalls limited 
on august   we completed the acquisition of technology and assets from pearsalls limited  a privately owned company based in the united kingdom pearsalls 
the acquired assets include an investigational nucleus like cervical disc replacement device called neodisc 
the total purchase price of million  including transaction costs  was recorded as technology development costs in the consolidated statement of operations in as the projects associated with the ipr d efforts  as of the date of the transaction  had still not yet reached technological feasibility and the continuing research and development in process had no alternative future uses 
in  the company began its first clinical trial in the united states for the neodisc cervical disc replacement device  which completed enrollment in august the trial protocol requires a two year follow up period on all patients before submitting to the us food and drug administration  or fda  for potential approval 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have incurred significant losses and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have not yet achieved profitability  and may not be profitable in to date  our operations have been funded primarily with proceeds from the sale of our equity securities which total million since inception  including million sold in the public markets

the net proceeds from the offering  after deducting the initial purchasers discount and costs directly related to the offering  were approximately million 
we will pay interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on march and september of each year 
the notes mature on march  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was million at december  and million at december  the increase is due primarily to the net proceeds from the notes issued in march of net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to million in we spent an incremental million during as compared to for inventory to support our increased operations and growing business and in preparation for the introduction of neurovision m  representing a significant upgrade to our core mas platform  which was introduced at the beginning of the fourth quarter of net cash used by investing activities was million in compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in the increase in net cash used by investing activities of million is primarily due to the net change of million in the activity in our investment portfolio  the net change of million in cash used to fund the acquisitions of the osteocel biologics business and the pedicle screw 
table of contents technology  and a million increase in capital asset purchases 
included in the million net increase of capital expenditures over the prior year  is approximately million and million of expenditures related to the new facility and for the implementation of our new erp system  respectively 
in  investing activity decreased significantly as cash was used to i acquire radius medical llc  ii invest in mbi and iii support the business operations 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in the increase in cash provided by financing activities of million is primarily due to the receipt of net proceeds of million from the issuance of the notes in march in  the proceeds from the sale of common stock under our equity plans increased by million 
in  we received and invested the proceeds of our secondary offering of million 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our working capital requirements and of our capital expenditures for additional loaner assets  our operating results  and cash used in any future acquisitions 
we have sufficient cash and investments on hand to finance our operations for the foreseeable future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity and risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related to our investment portfolio which consists largely of debt instruments of high quality corporate issuers and the us government and its agencies 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we have assessed that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
fixed rate investments and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted from changes in interest rates 
at december   we do not hold any material asset backed investment securities and in  we did not realize any losses related to asset backed investment securities 
based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december   a change of percent in interest rates  assuming the amount of our investment portfolio remains constant  would not have a material effect on interest expense 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
we have operated mainly in the united states of america  and the majority of our sales since inception have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
none of our investments are held for trading purposes 
our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average rate of return for our investment portfolio as of december  weighted average carrying value rate of return money market funds commercial paper corporate notes securities of government sponsored entities total interest bearing instruments as of december   the stated maturities of our investments are million within one year and million from one to three years 
these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
market price sensitive instruments 
in order to reduce the potential equity dilution  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions the hedge entitling us to purchase up to million shares of our common stock at an initial stock price of per share  each of which is subject to adjustment 
upon conversion of our convertible senior notes  the hedge is expected to reduce the equity dilution if the daily volume weighted average price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the hedge 
we also entered into warrant transactions 
table of contents with the counterparties of the hedge entitling them to acquire up to million shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment  at an initial strike price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock during a given measurement period the quarter or year to date period at maturity of the warrants exceeds the strike price of the warrants
