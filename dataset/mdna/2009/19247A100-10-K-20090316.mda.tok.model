critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents a thorough understanding of our accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position 
our management considers the following accounting policies critical to an informed review of our consolidated financial statements 
for a summary of these and additional accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
investments management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and re evaluates such determination at each statement of financial condition date 
securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased are classified as trading securities  and are measured at fair value based on quoted market prices with unrealized gains and losses reported in our consolidated statement of operations 
trading securities are attributable to the consolidation of our investment in our long short global real estate fund 
investments classified as available for sale are primarily comprised of investment grade preferred instruments and investments in our sponsored open end and closed end mutual funds 
these investments are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices or market prices obtained from independent pricing services engaged by management  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we periodically review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss  or impairment  to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 
if we believe an impairment on a security position is other than temporary  the loss will be recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in the net assets of an acquired company over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair value to their carrying amounts 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
we recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences that will result in deductible amounts in future years 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will result in taxable income in future years 
we record a valuation allowance  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation awards in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires public companies to recognize compensation expense for the grant date fair value of awards of equity instruments granted to employees 
this expense is recognized over the period during which employees are required to provide service 
sfas r also requires us to estimate forfeitures 
during the year ended december   we reduced our estimated forfeiture rate  resulting in an increase in employee compensation and benefits of approximately million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position  determining the fair value of a financial asset in a market that is not active  fsp which clarifies the application of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas in an inactive market and provides an illustrative example to demonstrate how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is not active 
the guidance provided by fsp is consistent with our approach to valuing financial assets for which there are no active markets 
in march  sfas no 
 disclosure about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of sfas no 
 sfas was issued 
sfas requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
we do not anticipate sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued staff position  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp  which delays the effective date of the application of sfas to fiscal years beginning after 
table of contents november  for all non financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a non recurring basis 
such non financial assets and liabilities include goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  long lived assets and finite lived intangible assets each measured at fair value for purposes of impairment testing  asset retirement and guarantee obligations initially measured at fair value  and those assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination or asset purchase 
the adoption of fsp did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards  eitf 
eitf requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units that are expected to vest be recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
the consensus reached in eitf should be applied prospectively to the income tax benefits of dividends declared in fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of eitf on january  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which allows companies to elect to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  was issued 
the fair value election can be made on an instrument by instrument basis but is irrevocable once made 
sfas is effective for the calendar year 
we did not elect to apply sfas to any financial assets or liabilities 
in september  sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and enhances disclosures about instruments carried at fair value  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument should be carried at fair value  was issued 
sfas is effective for the calendar year 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  but required additional disclosure 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of our business  we are exposed to the risk from changes in interest rate and currency rates and securities market and general economic fluctuations  which may have an adverse impact on the value of our investments and securities owned 
at december   we had approximately million of securities owned and approximately million of securities sold but not yet purchased  which were comprised primarily of domestic equities 
as of december   we had approximately million of investments  available for sale which were comprised of approximately million invested in our sponsored mutual funds  million invested in perpetual preferred securities  million invested in fixed rate preferred securities  million invested in foreign and domestic common stocks and million invested in fixed income instruments 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment loss of approximately million from investments primarily in federal national mortgage association fnma preferred securities 
the fnma preferred securities were sold during the third quarter of in the first quarter of  the company recorded other than temporary impairments on its investments  available for sale portfolio of approximately million 
in addition  a significant majority of our revenue approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively is derived from investment advisory agreements with our clients 
under these agreements  the investment advisory and administration fee we receive is based on the market value of the assets we manage 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities generally  and real estate securities in particular  may cause our revenue and income to decline by causing the value of the assets we manage to decrease  which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees  or causing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments that they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk  which would also result in lower investment advisory and administration fees 
in addition  market conditions currently preclude us from increasing the assets we manage in closed end mutual funds 
the market conditions for these offerings may continue to be unfavorable in the future  which will adversely impact our ability to grow the assets we manage and realize higher fee revenue associated with such growth 
as of december   of the assets we managed were concentrated in us real estate common stocks 
an increase in interest rates could have a negative impact on the valuation of reits and other 
table of contents securities in our clients portfolios  which could reduce our revenue 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could negatively impact our ability to increase open end mutual fund assets and to offer new mutual funds
