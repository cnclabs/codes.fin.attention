executive overview there have been traumatic developments in the capital markets worldwide over the past eighteen months 
these developments began with credit problems in residential real estate  which led to a lack of liquidity and dramatic depreciation of residential real estate  and by extension  residential mortgage backed securities 
the problems soon extended to disruptions in the markets and value of other structured finance products 
these developments caused a series of failures to befall a large number of financial institutions  which participated in the origination or underwriting of structured products or that invested in them 
public companies have had to depreciate their assets as trading values of structured finance products and other credit assets declined 
at the end of the first quarter of  the bear stearns companies  inc collapsed and was sold to jp morgan chase co  with a large amount of federal government assistance 
this was followed by almost weekly revelations of illiquid and teetering financial institutions  government assistance and rapid mergers including lehman brothers holdings  inc  washington mutual  inc  federal national mortgage association fannie mae  federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  american international group  inc  merrill lynch co  inc and wachovia corporation among others 
these developments have caused large and small corporations the world over to have significant difficulty borrowing on a short and long term basis and in raising capital 
this has adversely affected aspects of businesses that rely on borrowed funds and new capital to grow and fund operations 
we have been significantly impacted by these developments  as has virtually every financial institution in the world 
the global financial crisis has impacted our ability to currently access the debt and equity capital markets  has resulted in significant depreciation of our investment portfolio and may impact our ability to continue to exit portfolio investments in the near term 
we continued to generate liquidity through the sales and repayments of portfolio investments generating over billion of realizations of portfolio investments in 
table of contents however  although we currently have investments in various stages of the sales process  the increasing liquidity crisis could make it difficult for us to continue to generate significant liquidity through sales of portfolio investments at attractive prices 
we also believe that the liquidity crisis will limit our ability to raise public equity and public and privately sourced debt in our business plan assumes no new capital raises  continued delevering of our balance sheet and the reinvestment of capital only as we experience liquidity through realizations from exits and repayments 
going concern our independent registered public accounting firm  ernst young llp  has concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern  and has included an explanatory paragraph to describe this uncertainty in its audit report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
we incurred a net loss of billion and recognized billion of net unrealized depreciation on our portfolio investments for the year ended december  and our shareholders equity has decreased from billion as of december  to billion as of december  while there were declines in the performance of our portfolio investments during  a significant portion of the depreciation that we have reported to date is not the result of credit impairment of our underlying assets  but rather of an unprecedented widening of investment spreads caused by distressed selling in trading markets for assets deemed to be comparable to our assets  declines in purchase multiples of middle market acquisition transactions during and application of market yield analysis to assets that were acquired with the intent of holding them to settlement or maturity as opposed to trading them 
however  as a result of such unrealized depreciation  we are currently in breach of certain financial covenants under our revolving credit facilities and unsecured debt borrowing arrangements  which had an aggregate billion outstanding out of billion of total debt as of december  as a bdc  we are generally prohibited under the act from issuing any senior security representing indebtedness if immediately after such issuance we do not have an asset coverage ratio of at least  which is calculated as the amount of our total assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities  divided by senior securities representing indebtedness 
due to the significant net unrealized depreciation and resulting decrease in our shareholders equity during  we are currently below the asset coverage ratio required to issue additional debt 
also  we are in breach of the minimum consolidated tangible net worth  portfolio charge off and other asset coverage covenants in certain of our borrowing arrangements 
as a result  the lenders and note holders under such borrowing arrangements could discontinue lending and or declare all borrowings outstanding to be immediately due and payable after any applicable notice and or cure periods 
if any of these events occur  there is no assurance that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that would become due as a result of any such debt acceleration  or that we will be able to obtain additional or alternative financing to pay or refinance any such accelerated obligations 
we did not include any adjustments to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k to reflect the possible future effects that may result from the uncertainty of our ability to continue as a going concern because we believe that we will continue to be a financially sound and viable business  continuing to invest in the debt and equity capital of middle market companies and alternative asset funds  provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and provide value to our shareholders 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of restricted cash and cash equivalents  consisting primarily of interest and principal payments on assets that are securitized 
for the year ended december   we had million of positive cash flow from operating and investing activities  including billion of principal payments  prepayments and exits from portfolio investments 
management believes that we have adequate liquidity to continue to fund our operations and the interest payments on our borrowing arrangements in the absence of an acceleration of the maturity of such debt 
we have also undertaken or expect to commence the following efforts we have entered into discussions with the lenders under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our private unsecured note holders  and plan to enter into discussions with our public note holders  regarding a restructuring of the borrowing arrangements  
table of contents we expect to minimize our cash dividend distributions while maintaining our ric status  we reduced headcount by and offices by in  we reduced bonuses by in  we generated billion of principal payments  prepayments and exits in  we reduced debt by over million  or  since the second quarter of  we repaid all of our borrowings outstanding under our secured credit facility in the past year  and we have and continue to sell assets in the ordinary course of business in order to delever our balance sheet 
we also believe that we can carry out our plans and continue as a going concern  in part because our assets exceed our liabilities by billion based on fair value as determined by gaap  or nav per share 
furthermore  we believe that we can continue to generate net operating income from our investments over twice the amount of our interest payments in that exceeds our projected interest payments 
along with the fact that our assets exceed our liabilities by billion  and by billion when determined using our realizable value  will allow us either to successfully renegotiate the borrowing arrangements with our lenders and note holders or to reorganize under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  significantly mitigating the risk of a forced liquidation 
finally  apart from our securitized loans which are non recourse  none of our lenders currently have collateral security 
unsecured creditors generally have fewer rights than secured creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding 
however  if we successfully renegotiate or amend our unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured borrowing arrangements  we may have to provide a security interest to those lenders or note holders 
no assurance can be given that we will be successful in restructuring these borrowing arrangements on acceptable terms  if any  or amend such financial covenants in a manner sufficient to adequately reduce the risk of default in the near future 
should our lenders and or other counterparties demand immediate repayment of all of our obligations  we will likely be unable to pay such obligations 
in such event  we may have to recapitalize  refinance our obligations  sell some or all of our assets or seek to reorganize under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facility  during an event of default  the interest rate on our borrowings outstanding under the facility could increase by at our lenders option 
after all events of default under a credit facility have been cured or waived  the default rate for the facility is no longer applicable 
pursuant to the terms of our unsecured private notes  during an event of default  the note holders can declare that all amounts outstanding are immediately due and payable 
any overdue amount would accrue interest at a default rate equal to the greater of above the stated rate  or if applicable  the prime rate 
the note holders can rescind any acceleration if all late payments are made  all events of default are cured or waived and no judgment has been entered for the payment of money due under the notes 
pursuant to the terms of our public unsecured bonds  during an event of default  the trustee or the holders of at least in principal amount of the outstanding bonds may declare the principal and accrued interest to be due and payable immediately 
under certain circumstances  any such acceleration of the maturity of the bonds may be rescinded by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding bonds 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we decided to not elect the fair value option for our debt and therefore all of our debt liabilities are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at their stated maturity values of billion as of december  as of december   we estimate that the fair value of our debt is approximately billion  or billion less than the stated maturity values
