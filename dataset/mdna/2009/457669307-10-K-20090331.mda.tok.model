item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion also should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we are a development stage company with expertise in protein drug development 
our corporate office is located in richmond  virginia 
on february   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with merck co  inc merck whereby merck  through an affiliate  would purchase all assets related to our follow on biologics platform 
on march   we completed the sale of these assets for an aggregate purchase price of million 
after fees  taxes and other costs related to the transaction  we expect net proceeds of approximately million as a result of this transaction 
as part of this transaction  merck assumed the lease of our boulder  colorado based manufacturing facility and acquired ownership of all the equipment in the building 
in addition  upon closing of the transaction  merck offered positions to employees of the boulder facility 
we retain our richmond  va corporate office  which houses our clinical  regulatory  finance  and administrative functions  in support of the continuing iplex program 
until the sale of our follow on biologics platform  we pursued a dual path strategy involving entry into the follow on biologics arena also known as biosimilars  biogenerics and biologics and advancing our proprietary protein platform into niche markets with unmet needs 
as a result of the sale of our follow on biologics assets  we will primarily focus on our proprietary protein platform and our product  the fda approved iplex  which is in various stages of development for a number of serious medical conditions 
based on a comprehensive market analysis  our current resource allocation strategy for iplex is focused primarily on myotonic muscular dystrophy mmd followed by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als  also known as lou gehrig s disease 
other areas where iplex has also shown potential include retinopathy of prematurity rop 
we plan to use the net proceeds from the sale of our follow on biologics platform to continue to support the development of iplex and our proprietary protein platform and we are evaluating other options for use of these proceeds including product licensing  acquisitions of complimentary businesses or technologies  mergers  share repurchase and the distribution of a portion of the proceeds to shareholders 
we have not been profitable and have accumulated deficits of approximately million through december  while we expect that  following the sale of our fob assets to merck  for the balance of we will operate on a cash neutral basis as a result of anticipated revenues on our expanded access program and interest on the net proceeds of the sale of our fob assets offsetting our ongoing base costs  we expect to incur significant additional losses for at least the next several years until such time as sufficient commercial revenues are generated to offset expenses 
moving forward our major source of income is expected to be the cost recovery charges for our expanded access program and our major expenses will be related to research and development 
in general  our expenditures may increase as development of our product candidates progresses 
however  there will be fluctuations from period to period caused by differences in project costs incurred at each stage of development 
research and development activities since we began operations in late  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of a number of product candidates for metabolic and endocrine diseases 
until the sale of our fob assets on march   our research and development efforts were principally focused on pursuing a dual path strategy involving entry into the follow on biologics arena also known as biosimilars  biogenerics and biologics and advancing our proprietary protein platform into niche markets with unmet needs 
our focus is now principally on our proprietary protein platform 
our lead proprietary protein product  the fda approved iplex  is being studied as a treatment for several serious medical conditions including mmd and als 
we conduct very little of our own preclinical laboratory research 
we have outsourced several phase ii clinical studies with iplex and our other anti cancer product candidates  insm and rhigfbp  and plan on conducting additional clinical studies in the future 
all of our research and development expenditures  whether conducted by our own staff or by external scientists on our behalf and at our expense  are recorded as expenses as incurred and amounted to approximately million for the period since inception  in november  through december   and million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  costs to develop and manufacture products and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
all of our research and development expenditures related to our proprietary protein platform are interrelated as they are all associated with drugs that modulate igf i activity in the human body 
a significant finding in any one drug for a particular indication may provide benefits to our efforts across all of these products 
all of these products also share a substantial amount of our common fixed costs such as salaries  facility costs  utilities and maintenance 
given the small portion of research and development expenses that are related to products other than iplex we have determined that very limited benefits would be obtained from implementing cost tracking systems that would be necessary to allow for cost information on a product by product basis 
external clinical research of iplex in the mmd indication together with the development cost of the proposed iplex trial for als patients in the us are expected to represent our main research and development focus for our clinical trials with our product candidates are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are outside of our control  including the possibility that necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained 
for example  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that is determined to be appropriate in view of results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate 
our clinical trials may also be subject to delays or rejections based on our inability to enroll patients at the rate that we expect or our inability to produce clinical trial material in sufficient quantities and of sufficient quality to meet the schedule for our planned clinical trials 
moreover  all of our product candidates and particularly those that are in the preclinical or early clinical trial stage must overcome significant regulatory  technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
some of these product candidates may never reach the clinical trial stage of research and development 
as preclinical studies and clinical trials progress  we may determine that collaborative relationships will be necessary to help us further develop or to commercialize our product candidates  but such relationships may be difficult or impossible to arrange 
our projects or intended projects may also be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our research and development priorities and available resources 
any significant delays that occur or additional expenses that we incur may have a material adverse affect on our financial position and require us to raise additional capital sooner or in larger amounts than is presently expected 
in addition  as a result of the risks and uncertainties related to the development and approval of our product candidates and the additional uncertainties related to our ability to market and sell these products once approved for commercial sale  we are unable to provide a meaningful prediction regarding the period in which material net cash inflows from any of these projects is expected to become available 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for the full year totaled million  up from million in the corresponding period of this increase was primarily due to a million improvement in cost recovery from the eap to treat patients with als in italy 
the net loss for the months ended december  was million or per share  compared to million or per share for the months ended december  r d expenses increased to million from million  reflecting the higher activity as our clinical trials in the fob and iplex areas advanced 
sg a expenses fell to million from million  due to the elimination of litigation expenses following the march settlement and the removal of commercial expenses associated with our business restructuring plan 
interest income for the full year was million  compared to million for the full year this decrease was mainly due to lower interest rates and a lower average cash balance for the full year as compared to the full year interest expense for the months ended december  was million  compared to  for the corresponding period of this higher interest expense was due to an increase in the debt discount amortization resulting from the quarterly payment of our convertible notes  which began in march as of december   we had total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand of million  compared to million on hand as of december  the million decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments mainly reflected the use of million for operating activities and million for principal and interest repayments of our convertible notes  which began on march  fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for the full year totaled million  up from million in the corresponding period of this increase was due to improvements in the cost recovery from our eap and the receipt of licensing income from our agreement with napo pharmaceuticals inc  napo  combined with increased sales of iplex during the first quarter of the net loss for the months ended december  was million or per share  compared to million or per share for the months ended december  r d expenses dropped to million from million  reflecting lower litigation expenses which were included in r d expenses during the first quarter of  and reduced commercial manufacturing activity in sg a expenses fell to million from million  due to a combination of reduced litigation expenses  which were included in sg a expenses for the final three quarters of  and the elimination of commercial expenses in interest income for the full year was million  compared to million for the full year this decrease was mainly due to lower interest rates and a lower average cash balance for the full year as compared to the full year interest expense for the months ended december  was  compared to million for corresponding period of this decrease in interest expense resulted from lower amortization of the debt discount associated with our march financing  as a significant acceleration of the discount took place in due to the conversion of notes into shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand of million  compared to million on hand as of december  the million decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments mainly reflected the use of million for operating activities and a  investment in napo  which was partially offset by net proceeds of million from an offering of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock and million from the reduction of an outstanding letter of credit 
accounts payable and accrued project costs and other decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of decreased litigation activity 
stockholders equity decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in our common stock financing in may  we received net proceeds of million  but this was offset by our net loss of million for fiscal our accumulated deficit at december   increased to approximately million from million at december  due to our fiscal net loss of million 
liquidity and capital resources there is considerable time and cost associated with developing a potential drug or pharmaceutical product to the point where fda approval for sales is received 
in our financial management  we seek to raise the funds necessary for such development primarily through the issuance of equity securities in private placement transactions 
however  it is our intention to pursue additional financing options  including entering into agreements with corporate partners in order to provide milestone payments  license fees and equity investments 
we have funded our operations to date through public and private placements of debt and equity securities and the proceeds from the recently announced sale of our fob manufacturing facility to merck 
we plan to continue incurring losses as we expand our research and development and do not expect material revenues for at least the next several years 
at december   our cash and short term investments were approximately million  and were invested in money market instruments and municipal bonds 
this is a decrease of million from fiscal  as a result of our cash use during the year 
expenditures in fiscal were principally related to research and development  clinical trial activity  manufacturing activity and administrative activity at our sites in boulder  colorado  and richmond  virginia 
planned expenditures in include the funding of our ongoing research and development activity  such as clinical trial costs  and general and administrative support costs 
on march   we completed the sale of our fob assets for an aggregate purchase price of million 
after fees  taxes and other costs related to the transaction  we expect net proceeds of approximately million as a result of this transaction 
we believe these net proceeds will provide sufficient liquidity for us to continue as a going concern 
even though we currently have sufficient funds to meet our financial needs for the upcoming year  our business strategy also contemplates raising additional capital through debt or equity sales 
in the future  we may require additional funds for the continued development of our potential product candidates or to pursue acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies 
there can be no assurance that adequate funds will be available when we need them or on favorable terms 
if at any time we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds  we will be required to delay  restrict or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  dispose of assets or technology or cease operations 
we also plan to enter into agreements with corporate partners in order to fund operations through milestone payments  license fees and equity investments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that we believe is material to investors 
contractual obligations we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts as set forth below contractual obligations in thousands payments due by years less than more than total year years years years long term debt operating lease obligations long term debt obligations reflect the future interest and principal payments of the company s convertible notes outstanding as of december  we began repaying these notes in quarterly installments  beginning on march  we will continue to make payments on the notes through unless they are converted to common shares at an earlier date 
critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions 
we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions 
the accounting policies discussed below are those we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
for additional accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  cost to develop and manufacture products  patent protection costs and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
we do not have separate accounting policies for internal or external research and development and we do not conduct any research and development for others 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with third party organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
these contracts set forth the scope of work to be completed at a fixed fee or amount per patient enrolled 
payments under these contracts depend on performance criteria such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones 
expenses are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and to activity according to the clinical trial protocol 
litigation costs as they relate to our patents are recorded as research and development expenditures 
however  from may through december  the company shifted from research and development operations to commercial operations  and litigation costs were recorded as a selling  general and administrative activity during this time 
revenue recognition we record revenue from product sales when the goods are delivered and title passes to the customer 
at the time of sale  estimates for sales deductions  including rebates to government agencies  are recorded 
these provisions are provided for in the same period the related product sales are recorded 
following our settlement agreement with tercica and genentech on march   we ceased to supply iplex to patients and discontinued sales of iplex as of march  revenue from our expanded access program in italy is recognized when the drugs have been provided to program patients and collectability is assured 
royalties that were paid to tercica and genentech are netted against expanded access program revenue 
license income is recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved and payments are due 
grant revenue is recognized once payment has been received 
stock based compensation we adopted the fair value based method of accounting for share based payments effective january   using the modified prospective transition method described in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
currently  we use the black scholes merton formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and expect to continue to use this option valuation model 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized during the year included a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  share based payments  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair valued estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  share based payments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess cash in investment grade  interest bearing securities and  at december   had million invested in money market instruments and municipal bonds 
such investments are subject to interest rate and credit risk 
our policy of investing in highly rated securities whose liquidities at december   are all less than six months minimizes such risks 
in addition  while a hypothetical one percent per annum decrease in market interest rates would have reduced our interest income for fiscal  it would not have resulted in a loss of the principal and the decline in interest income would have been immaterial 
our purpose in making these investments is to generate investment income 
we currently do not transact any significant portion of our business in functional currencies other than the us dollar 
to the extent that we continue to transact our business using the us dollar as our functional currency  we do not believe that the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
