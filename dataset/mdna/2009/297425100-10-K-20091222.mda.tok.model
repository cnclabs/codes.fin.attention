sales in all segments include domestic  international  defense and commercial customers 
our current business and strategic plan focuses on the continued development of our products principally for aerospace and defense markets 
we continue to concentrate our efforts to expand our capabilities in these markets and to anticipate the global needs of our customers and respond to such needs with comprehensive solutions 
these efforts focus on continuous research and new product development  acquisitions and strategic realignments of operations to expand our capabilities as a more comprehensive supplier to our customers across our entire product offering 
on november   we sold muirhead aerospace muirhead and traxsys input products limited traxsys for million  which resulted in an after tax gain of million 
muirhead and traxsys were included in the sensors systems segment 
the results of muirhead and traxsys were accounted for as discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement 
on december   we acquired nmc group  inc nmc 
nmc designs and manufactures specialized light weight fasteners principally for commercial aviation applications 
nmc is included in our advanced materials segment and the results of its operations were included from the effective date of the acquisition 
on january   we acquired racal acoustics global ltd 
racal acoustics 
racal acoustics develops and manufactures high technology ruggedized personal communication equipment for the defense and avionics market 
racal acoustics is included in our avionics controls segment and the results of its operations were included from the effective date of the acquisition 
during fiscal  our operating results have been affected by volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  reductions in our after market spares sales due to reduced air traffic and operating losses at our countermeasure flare units 
additionally  fiscal contained weeks  while fiscal contained weeks 
while our operating results were impacted by these factors  we have benefited from significantly improved results at our avionics systems operations  incremental earnings from our racal acoustics acquisition and consistent results at our control systems  power systems and combustible ordnance operations 
these operations benefited from continued demand for defense applications  reduced research and development expenditures and increased funding from customers and governments as well as effective cost control 
our year end backlog of billion benefited from the addition of nmc and racal acoustics acquired backlog 
orders declined from fiscal the decrease in orders in reflected a significant avionics systems retrofit order in  the effect of foreign currency rates and lower demand for commercial aviation and industrial commercial applications 
as we look to fiscal  we will continue to invest in research  development and engineering and focus on cost control in light of current market conditions in commercial aviation as well as strong competition in our advanced sensors  engineered materials and countermeasure flare operations 
income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share in fiscal income from continuing operations in fiscal was impacted by a foreign currency loss of million or million after tax  or per diluted share  relating to the pound sterling denominated funding of our acquisition of racal acoustics in january the effective income tax rate for fiscal was before a million tax benefit or per diluted share compared with before a million tax benefit or per diluted share for fiscal income from discontinued operations was per diluted share  compared with per diluted share in fiscal  reflecting the gain on sale of our uk based muirhead and traxsys subsidiaries in november net income was million or per diluted share  compared with net income of million or per diluted share in fiscal results of continuing operations fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal decreased over the prior year 
sales by segment were as follows dollars in thousands increase decrease from prior year avionics controls sensors systems advanced materials total the increase in avionics controls reflected incremental sales from the racal acoustics acquisition and higher sales of cockpit avionics systems for military aviation 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of cockpit controls for commercial aviation oem and after market customers 
stronger sales of interface technologies devices to the gaming industry partially offset weakness in the medical market 
the decrease in sensors systems principally reflected the effect of foreign currency exchange rates at our non us operations  lower oem sales of temperature sensors  certain power system devices  and the decrease in the number of weeks contained in fiscal compared to fiscal the decline in sensors systems sales for commercial aviation was partially offset by increased sales for military aviation 
sales through much of fiscal reflected a weaker euro relative to the us dollar 
the average exchange rate for the euro decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the average exchange rate for the pound sterling to the us dollar decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in advanced materials reflected weak sales across the segment due to lower commercial aviation build rates  weakened industrial commercial demand  delays in shipments at our us and us countermeasure flare operations and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates 
these decreases were partially offset by incremental sales from the acquisition of nmc 
the decrease in sales at our us countermeasure flare operations reflected a one month factory shutdown resulting from an incident in a cross blending facility 
the factory resumed operation in august but was further impacted by the delay in issuance of a multi year flare order from the us dod 
sales to foreign customers  including export sales by domestic operations  totaled million and million  and accounted for and of our sales for fiscal and  respectively 
overall  gross margin as a percentage of sales was and in fiscal and  respectively 
avionics controls segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
avionics systems gross margins in fiscal were enhanced by t b production sales and a military transport cockpit retrofit program  which offset weak results from our commercial aviation business 
gross margins in both fiscal and were impacted by estimate to complete adjustments on certain long term contracts of million and million  respectively 
these adjustments were principally due to higher engineering costs as a result of resource constraints to develop upgraded commercial and military flight management systems 
control systems gross margins benefited from strong cost control actions taken early in the fiscal year  which offset the impact of lower commercial aviation sales and decreased after market spare sales 
sensors systems segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
gross margins were impacted by lower sales of temperature sensors and power systems to commercial aviation customers and a million write off of inventory due to the bankruptcy of eclipse 
advanced materials segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively  principally reflecting reduced gross margins at our us and us countermeasure flare operations 
our us countermeasure flare operations gross margin was impacted by a one month shutdown of the factory due to an incident referred to above and a delayed receipt of a multi year flare award 
our uk countermeasure flare operations gross margin was impacted by a delayed shipment to an international customer 
accordingly  our recovery of fixed expenses at both our us and us operations decreased compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses which include corporate expenses slightly increased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from the racal acoustics and nmc acquisitions and higher pension cost was substantially offset by the effect of exchange rates at our non us operations as well as lower incentive compensation expense  professional fees and effective cost control 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in fiscal and  respectively 
research  development and related engineering spending decreased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal the decrease in research  development and engineering principally reflected decreased spending on the development of the integrated cockpit system for the t b military trainer  the am  increased customer and government assistance and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates 
segment earnings which exclude corporate expenses and other income and expense decreased during fiscal to million compared to million in the prior year 
segment earnings as a percent of sales were and in fiscal and  respectively 
avionics controls segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  reflecting strong earnings from our avionics systems operations and incremental earnings from our racal acoustics acquisition 
the improvement in avionics systems operating earnings principally reflected lower research  development and engineering expense for the t b military trainer 
our avionics systems business also benefited from strong earnings from production sales of our t b military trainer and a military transport cockpit retrofit program  which offset weakness in commercial aviation 
approximately of avionics systems canada based operations sales are denominated in us dollars and about of these sales are covered by forward contracts 
accounts receivable and the accounts payable denominated in us dollars and backlog denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the company or its customer embedded derivatives are marked to market each period 
while the average exchange rate for the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  our canadian operations were not favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange in fiscal to the extent our sales were covered by foreign currency forward contracts executed before the drop in the canadian dollar 
fiscal was favorably impacted by the significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar from the end of our third fiscal quarter of to the end of our fourth quarter from marking to market our monetary assets and embedded derivatives 
control systems earnings benefited from cost control actions and strong earnings from sales of military aviation applications  which partially offset weak earnings from commercial aviation 
in connection with a control systems business unit relocation  we will incur lease termination costs of million in the first quarter of fiscal earnings from our interface technologies operations decreased from the prior year period due to lower earnings from a new product development with introductory pricing for a limited number of shipments and reduced earnings from our medical business 
sensors systems segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal the decrease in segment earnings principally reflected lower gross margins at our temperature and pressure sensors operations  start up costs at our mexico operation  a million inventory write off  and a million impairment on a subsidiary trade name 
management determined that a certain trade name useful life was no longer indefinite as a result of further integration of advanced sensors units and promotion of the advanced sensors brand name 
an impairment test was required to be performed to value the trade name at fair value  which resulted in the impairment charge 
the remaining book value of the trade name will be amortized to expense over its remaining five year useful life 
advanced sensors successfully negotiated a retroactive price increase in fiscal  however  the business continues to be impacted by a very competitive business environment in a down commercial aircraft market 
management has taken actions to reduce cost including but not limited to setting up operations in mexico 
our power systems earnings were consistent with fiscal lower gross margins at our power systems operations were substantially offset by decreased research  engineering and development due to increased governmental assistance and customer development funding and decreased am program development expenses 
advanced materials segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  principally reflecting lower earnings from our countermeasure flare and engineered materials operations 
as stated above  our us countermeasure flare operations were impacted by a one month factory closure due to an incident in the cross blending facility and a delay in a multi year flare order 
additionally  earnings at our uk countermeasure flare operations were impacted by a delayed shipment to an international customer 
our us and us countermeasure flare operations incurred operating losses in both fiscal and accordingly  management is focused on improving margins on existing products 
the decrease in earnings at our engineered materials operations mainly reflected lower sales volumes and gross margins due to sales mix and a decreased recovery of fixed costs in a very competitive market in a down business cycle 
interest expense decreased to million during fiscal compared with million in the prior year  reflecting a lower interest rate 
on january   we acquired racal acoustics for million or million 
racal acoustics develops and manufactures high technology ruggedized personal communication equipment for the defense market segment 
the acquisition was funded with cash proceeds from the sale of uk based muirhead and traxsys and our line of credit 
to facilitate the acquisition of racal acoustics  we executed a million us dollar denominated intercompany loan with a wholly owned subsidiary  for which its functional currency is the pound sterling 
due to our holding of pounds sterling to fund the acquisition during a period of foreign exchange volatility  we incurred a million foreign currency transaction loss in january  which was recorded in other expense 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared with in fiscal the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate  as both years benefited from various tax credits and certain foreign interest expense deductions 
in fiscal  we recognized million in net discrete tax benefits 
the million discrete tax benefits were the result of five events 
the first event was a million tax benefit for the reduction of previously recorded withholding tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of a us canadian tax treaty 
the second event was a million expense resulting from the reversal of previously recorded tax benefits associated with the implementation of cmc s sadi program 
the third event was a million tax benefit associated with the reconciliation of the prior year s us income tax return to the us income tax provision 
the fourth event was an adjustment that resulted in a reclassification of million of tax benefits from discontinued operations to continued operations offset by a million tax expense to establish a valuation allowance for us foreign tax credits that are not expected to result in a current or future reduction in us income taxes 
the fifth event was a million tax expense associated with the reconciliation of the prior year s foreign income tax returns to the foreign income tax provisions 
in fiscal  we recognized million in discrete tax benefits 
the million in discrete tax adjustments were the result of five items 
the first item was the settlement of an examination of the us income tax returns for fiscal years through  which resulted in a million reduction of previously estimated income tax liabilities 
the second item was the enactment of tax laws reducing the canadian statutory corporate income tax rate  which resulted in a million net reduction of deferred income tax liabilities 
the third item was the accrual of million of tax reserves and interest related to the finalization of cmc s uncertain tax position analysis 
the fourth item was recording million of tax expense associated with the reconciliation of fiscal s us income tax return provision for income taxes 
the fifth item was the recording of million of tax benefits associated with the extension of the us research experimentation tax credit 
to the extent that sales are transacted in a currency other than the functional currency of the operating unit  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
we use forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk 
to the extent that these hedges qualify under us gaap  the amount of gain or loss is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the related sale occurs 
also  we are subject to foreign currency gains or losses from embedded derivatives on backlog denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of our operating companies or its customers 
gains and losses on forward contracts  embedded derivatives  and revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in currency other than the functional currency of the company for fiscal and are as follows in thousands forward foreign currency contracts gain loss forward foreign currency contracts reclassified from aoci embedded derivatives gain loss revaluation of monetary assets liabilities gain loss total new orders for fiscal were billion compared with billion for fiscal orders in fiscal include million in backlog acquired from the racal acoustics and nmc acquisitions 
new orders declined by million if racal acoustics and nmc acquired backlog is excluded 
avionics controls orders for fiscal decreased from the prior year period  excluding acquired backlog from the racal acoustics acquisition 
the decrease in avionics controls reflects a million order for a military transport cockpit upgrade booked in october and reduced requirements for commercial aviation 
sensors systems orders for fiscal decreased from the prior year period  principally reflecting reduced requirements for commercial aviation and the effects of foreign currency exchange rates 
advanced materials orders for fiscal decreased from the prior year period  excluding acquired backlog from the nmc acquisition 
the decrease principally reflected reduced requirements for defense  commercial aviation and industrial commercial requirements 
backlog at the end of both fiscal and was billion 
approximately million is scheduled to be delivered after fiscal backlog is subject to cancellation until delivery 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal increased over the prior year 
sales by segment were as follows dollars in thousands increase decrease from prior year avionics controls sensors systems advanced materials total the increase in avionics controls reflected incremental sales from the cmc acquisition and higher sales of cockpit controls and medical equipment devices from new oem programs as well as strong after market sales 
the increase in sensors systems principally reflected growth in oem programs for power systems and strong after market sales of temperature and pressure sensors  as well as the effect of exchange rates 
sales through much of fiscal reflected a stronger euro relative to the us dollar 
the average exchange rate for the euro increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this relationship changed significantly in the fourth fiscal quarter of when the spot rate declined from at august   to at october  the increase in advanced materials reflected strong sales across the segment and reflected higher sales at our engineered materials operations due to increased demand from commercial aviation customers 
additionally  sales of combustible ordnance and countermeasure flare devices at our uk operations were strong in fiscal these increases were partially offset by lower sales of countermeasure flare devices at our us operations 
sales to foreign customers  including export sales by domestic operations  totaled million and million  and accounted for and of our sales for fiscal and  respectively 
overall  gross margin as a percentage of sales was and in fiscal and  respectively 
avionics controls segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively  principally reflecting the effect of exchange rates on our canadian operations in the fourth fiscal quarter of the us dollar strengthened against the canadian dollar from at the end of our third fiscal quarter of to at the end of our fourth fiscal quarter 
changes in exchange rates mainly affected avionics systems us dollar denominated accounts receivable  foreign exchange contracts and backlog 
the impact of exchange rates on us dollar denominated accounts receivable  backlog and forward exchange contracts favorably impacted gross margin in the fourth fiscal quarter of by approximately million compared to a million loss in the prior year period 
the effect of foreign exchange on cmc s gross margin was a gain of approximately million in fiscal and a loss in fiscal of approximately million 
approximately million of avionics systems us dollar denominated backlog at october   is covered by forward exchange contracts  which are accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
approximately million of backlog covered by forward exchange contracts were executed before the strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar 
accordingly  the strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar will not be realized on us dollar denominated sales covered by forward contracts executed before the dollar began to strengthen against the canadian dollar 
avionics systems gross margins in fiscal were also enhanced by an improved recovery of fixed overhead due to higher sales volumes  cost reductions and productivity improvements 
the increase in avionics systems gross margin was partially offset by a million estimate to complete adjustment for long term contracts recorded in the third fiscal quarter of the adjustment was principally due to higher engineering costs as a result of resource constraints  increased scope and additional certification requirements to develop upgraded commercial aviation flight management systems 
excluding avionics systems  avionics controls gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively  reflecting increased after market spares sales and pricing strength on certain cockpit control devices  partially offset by an increase in excess and obsolete inventory reserves and a million and a million unfavorable estimate to complete adjustment on certain firm fixed price long term contracts for the development and manufacture of secure military communications products in fiscal and  respectively 
sensors systems segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
gross margins mainly reflected strong after market sales  partially offset by the effect of a weaker us dollar compared with the euro on us denominated sales and euro denominated cost of sales for most of fiscal the impact of exchange rates on forward foreign exchange contracts impacted gross margin at our euro based operations by a gain of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
forward exchange contracts at our non us sensor systems units are principally accounted for as a cash flow hedge and  accordingly  unrealized gains or losses are recognized upon settlement of the forward exchange contract 
advanced materials segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in advanced materials gross margin was due to increased gross margins at our combustible ordnance and uk countermeasure flare operations as well as our elastomer and thermally engineered component operations resulting from pricing strength on certain products and an improved recovery of overhead due to higher product sales and a more favorable mix of product shipments 
selling  general and administrative expenses which include corporate expenses increased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses mainly reflected incremental selling  general and administrative expenses from the cmc acquisition  which was acquired in march  higher incentive compensation expense  and the effect of exchange rates at our non us operations 
the effect of exchange rates on cash held by the corporate office and certain intercompany advances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar resulted in an exchange loss of million in fiscal compared to a million gain in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in fiscal and  respectively 
research  development and related engineering spending increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in research  development and engineering principally reflected incremental spending from the cmc acquisition and increased spending on the development of the integrated cockpit system for the t b military trainer 
research  development and engineering expense in fiscal and is net of million and million  respectively  in government assistance 
segment earnings which exclude corporate expenses and other income and expense increased during fiscal to million compared to million in the prior year 
segment earnings as a percent of sales were and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in segment earnings as a percent of sales from fiscal reflects business insurance recoveries of million recorded in fiscal avionics controls segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  reflecting strong earnings from our avionics  cockpit control and medical equipment devices operations  partially offset by the shipment in fiscal of acquired inventory of cmc  which was valued at fair value at acquisition 
in addition  cmc s earnings in fiscal were favorably affected by the effect of a stronger us dollar compared with the canadian dollar  particularly in the fourth quarter  which resulted in a foreign currency transaction gain on us dollar denominated accounts receivable and backlog in the fourth quarter of fiscal avionics controls earnings were impacted by significant research and development expenses  principally related to the development of the t b and a gross profit reduction of million due to an estimate to complete adjustment on long term contracts compared to a million adjustment in the prior year period 
the prior year period was also impacted by million in contract overruns and additional research and development expense at a small unit which manufactures precision gears and data concentrators 
cmc s results of operations are not in accordance with our expectations since acquisition 
as indicated above  avionics systems results of operations were impacted by the weak us dollar relative to the canadian dollar for most of the period since our acquisition of the business and higher than expected research and development expenses related to the t b development 
recognizing the impact of these issues  management is focused on a broad array of initiatives designed to improve avionics systems results of operations 
sensors systems segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal the increase in sensors systems earnings reflected strong results across all operations helped by increased sales from new oem programs  as well as strong after market sales 
sensors systems segment earnings in the fourth quarter for fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
the decrease in segment earnings principally reflected lower gross margin due to start up costs of a manufacturing operation in a low cost country  a less favorable product mix and the purchase of a technology license  which was recorded as research and development expense 
certain temperature  pressure  and speed sensors are not achieving profit margins the company projects for the long term 
management is focused on improving its operational efficiency and negotiating with customers to increase pricing where price increases can be justified 
the impact of exchange rates on us dollar denominated accounts receivable and foreign exchange contracts impacted sensors systems earnings by a gain of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
advanced materials segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  principally reflecting million in business interruption insurance recoveries in fiscal the impact of exchange rates on us dollar denominated accounts receivable and forward foreign exchange contracts impacted advanced material earnings at our uk operations by a loss of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
on june   an explosion occurred at the company s wallop facility  which resulted in one fatality and several minor injuries 
the incident destroyed an oven complex for the production of advanced flares and significantly damaged a portion of the facility 
the advanced flare facility has been closed due to the requirements of the health and safety executive hse to review the cause of the accident  but normal operations are continuing at unaffected portions of the facility 
the hse investigation will not be completed until the coroner s inquest is filed 
although it is not possible to determine the results of the hse investigation or how the coroner will rule  management does not expect to be found in breach of the health and safety at work act related to the accident and  accordingly  no amounts have been recorded for any potential fines that may be assessed by the hse 
excluding the business insurance recovery  results of operations at our uk countermeasure flare operation improved by million over fiscal this trend is expected to continue  however  poor product mix in fiscal resulted in our us and us countermeasure flare operations recording an operating loss 
the decrease in earnings described above was partially offset by strong earnings from our thermally engineered components  elastomer and combustible ordnance operations 
interest expense decreased to million during fiscal compared with million in the prior year  reflecting reduced borrowings 
non operating expenses included a million gain from a terminated interest rate swap on our million term loan  resulting from a million or million repayment 
non operating expenses in fiscal included a million write off of debt issuance costs as a result of the prepayment of our million us term loan 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared with in fiscal the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate  as both years benefited from various tax credits and certain foreign interest expense deductions 
in addition  in fiscal  we recognized million in discrete tax benefits 
the million in discrete tax adjustments were the result of five items 
the first item was the settlement of an examination of the us income tax returns for fiscal years through  which resulted in a million reduction of previously estimated income tax liabilities 
the second item was the enactment of tax laws reducing the canadian statutory corporate income tax rate  which resulted in a million net reduction of deferred income tax liabilities 
the third item was the accrual of million of tax reserves and interest related to the finalization of cmc s uncertain tax position analysis 
the fourth item was recording million of tax expense associated with the reconciliation of fiscal s us income tax return provision for income taxes 
the fifth item was the recording of million of tax benefits associated with the extension of the us research experimentation tax credit 
in fiscal  we recognized million in net discrete tax benefits 
the million in net discrete tax benefits were the result of three items 
the first item was the enactment of tax laws reducing uk  canadian  and german statutory corporate income tax rates which resulted in a million net reduction in deferred income tax liabilities 
the second item was the retroactive extension of the us research experimentation tax credit  which resulted in a million tax benefit 
the third item was recording million of additional income tax resulting from the reconciliation of fiscal s us and foreign income tax returns to the provisions for income taxes 
new orders for fiscal were billion compared with billion for fiscal avionics controls orders for fiscal increased from the prior year period 
avionics controls orders in fiscal included cmc s acquired backlog at march   of million 
sensors systems orders for fiscal increased from the prior year period 
advanced materials orders for fiscal decreased from the prior year period due to the timing of receiving defense system orders 
backlog at the end of fiscal was billion compared with million at the end of the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources working capital and statement of cash flows cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal totaled million  an increase of million from the prior year 
net working capital increased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of the prior year 
sources of cash flows from operating activities principally consist of cash received from the sale of products offset by cash payments for material  labor and operating expenses 
cash flows from operating activities were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase principally reflected higher cash receipts from customers and lower payments for inventory  income taxes  and interest 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in pension plan contributions 
cash flows used by investing activities were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in the use of cash for investing activities mainly reflected cash paid for acquisitions in fiscal  partially offset by cash proceeds from the sale of muirhead and traxsys 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million in fiscal and cash flows used by financing activities were million in fiscal the increase principally reflected a million term loan due in to finance the racal acoustics acquisition  offset by million in repayments on our uk term loan 
cash used by financing activities in fiscal principally reflected a million or million principal payment on our uk term loan 
capital expenditures net property  plant and equipment was million at the end of fiscal compared with million at the end of the prior year 
capital expenditures for fiscal and were million and million  respectively excluding acquisitions and included facilities  machinery and equipment and enhancements to information technology systems 
capital expenditures for fiscal and also included million and million  respectively  under a capitalized lease obligation related to the construction of a new facility for an avionics controls operation and a facility expansion for an interface technologies facility 
capital expenditures are anticipated to approximate million for fiscal we will continue to support expansion through investments in infrastructure including machinery  equipment  buildings and information systems 
acquisitions on december   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of nmc group  inc nmc for approximately million in cash  including acquisition costs 
nmc designs and manufactures specialized light weight fasteners principally for commercial aviation applications 
nmc is included in our advanced materials segment 
on january   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of racal acoustics global ltd 
racal acoustics for million or million in cash  including acquisition costs 
racal acoustics develops and manufactures high technology ruggedized personal communication equipment for the defense and avionics market segment 
racal acoustics is included in our avionics controls segment 
debt financing total debt increased million from the prior year to million at the end of fiscal total debt outstanding at the end of fiscal  consisted of million of senior notes due in  million of senior subordinated notes due in  million of the us term loan  million of deferred gain on a terminated interest rate swap  million under capital lease obligations  and million in borrowings under our credit facility and various foreign currency debt agreements and other debt agreements 
the senior notes are due in and bear an interest rate of 
the senior notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the company 
the senior notes are guaranteed  jointly and severally on a senior basis  by all the existing and future domestic subsidiaries of the company unless designated as an unrestricted subsidiary  and those foreign subsidiaries that executed related subsidiary guarantees under the indenture covering the senior notes 
the senior notes are subject to redemption at the option of the company at any time prior to march   at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued interest to the date of redemption and a make whole provision 
in addition  before march   the company may redeem up to of the principal amount at plus accrued interest with proceeds of one or more public equity offerings 
the senior notes are also subject to redemption at the option of the company  in whole or in part  on or after march   at redemption prices starting at of the principal amount plus accrued interest during the period beginning march   and declining annually to of principal and accrued interest on or after march  the senior subordinated notes are due in and bear an interest rate of 
the senior subordinated notes are general unsecured obligations of the company and are subordinated to all existing and future senior debt of the company 
in addition  the senior subordinated notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future senior debt and other liabilities including trade payables of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
the senior subordinated notes are guaranteed  jointly and severally  by all the existing and future domestic subsidiaries of the company unless designated as an unrestricted subsidiary under the indenture covering the senior subordinated notes 
the senior subordinated notes are subject to redemption at the option of the company  in whole or in part  on or after june   at redemption prices starting at of the principal amount and declining annually to of the principal amount on june   together with accrued interest 
in april  we amended our credit facility to provide for a million term loan 
we used the proceeds from the loan to repay our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and provide for enhanced liquidity 
borrowings under the us term loan facility bear interest at a rate equal to either a the libor rate plus or b the base rate defined as the higher of wachovia bank  national association s prime rate and the federal funds rate plus plus 
the loan is accruing interest at a variable rate based on libor plus and was on october  the principal amount of the us term loan facility is payable quarterly commencing on march   the first four payments equal to of the original loan balance  the following four payments equal to  with a final payment equal to on march  during fiscal  we repaid the remaining balance of million of our million uk term loan 
during fiscal we paid down million  or million  of our million uk term loan and terminated an interest rate swap for a gain of million 
the interest rate swap exchanged the variable interest rate for a fixed interest rate of plus an additional margin amount determined by reference to our leverage ratio 
we believe cash on hand  funds generated from operations and other available debt facilities are sufficient to fund operating cash requirements and capital expenditures through fiscal  however  we may periodically utilize our lines of credit for working capital requirements 
current conditions in the capital markets are uncertain  however  we believe we will have adequate access to capital markets to fund future acquisitions 
pension and other post retirement benefit obligations our pension plans principally include a us pension plan maintained by esterline and non us plans maintained by cmc 
a non us plan maintained by leach was merged into the us pension plan maintained by esterline as of march  our principal post retirement plans include non us plans maintained by cmc  which are non contributory health care and life insurance plans 
we account for pension expense using the end of the fiscal year as our measurement date and we make actuarially computed contributions to our pension plans as necessary to adequately fund benefits 
our funding policy is consistent with the minimum funding requirements of erisa 
in fiscal and  operating cash flow included million and million  respectively  of cash funding to these pension plans 
we expect pension funding requirements for the plans maintained by esterline and cmc to be approximately million and million  respectively  in fiscal the rate of increase in future compensation levels is consistent with our historical experience and salary administration policies 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on long term target asset allocations of equity and fixed income 
we periodically review allocations of plan assets by investment type and evaluate external sources of information regarding long term historical returns and expected future returns for each investment type and  accordingly  believe a to assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is appropriate 
current allocations are consistent with the long term targets 
we made the following assumptions with respect to our pension obligation in and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate rate of increase in future compensation levels assumed long term rate of return on plan assets we use a discount rate for expected returns that is a spot rate developed from a yield curve established from high quality corporate bonds and matched to plan specific projected benefit payments 
although future changes to the discount rate are unknown  had the discount rate increased or decreased by basis points in  pension liabilities in total would have decreased million or increased million  respectively 
if all other assumptions are held constant  the estimated effect on fiscal pension expense from a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in both the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would not have a material effect on our pension expense 
we made the following assumptions with respect to our post retirement obligation in and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate initial weighted average health care trend rate ultimate weighted average health care trend rate the assumed health care trend rate has a significant impact on our post retirement benefit obligations 
our health care trend rate was based on the experience of our plan and expectations for the future

a basis point decrease in the health care trend rate would decrease our post retirement benefit obligation by million 
assuming all other assumptions are held constant  the estimated effect on fiscal post retirement benefit expense from a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in the health care trend rate would not have a material effect on our post retirement benefit expense

we estimate that research and development expense in fiscal will be to of sales for the full year 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of fiscal year end

moreover  our first fiscal quarter  november through january  includes significant holiday vacation periods in both europe and north america 
this leads to decreased order and shipment activity  consequently  first quarter results are typically weaker than other quarters and not necessarily indicative of our performance in subsequent quarters

to the extent that sales are transacted in a foreign currency  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
furthermore  we have assets denominated in foreign currencies that are not offset by liabilities in such foreign currencies 
at october   we had the following monetary assets subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk us dollar denominated backlog with customers whose functional currency is other than the us dollar  us dollar denominated accounts receivable and payable  and certain forward contracts  which are not accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
the foreign exchange rate for the dollar relative to the euro decreased to at october   from at october   the dollar relative to the uk pound decreased to from  and the dollar relative to the canadian dollar decreased to from 
foreign currency transactions affecting monetary assets and forward contracts resulted in a million loss in fiscal  a million gain in fiscal  and a million loss in fiscal the million loss in fiscal was principally due to our holding of pounds sterling to fund the racal acoustics acquisition during a period of foreign exchange volatility  resulting in a million foreign currency transaction loss in january our policy is to hedge a portion of our forecasted transactions using forward exchange contracts with maturities up to months 
the company does not enter into any forward contracts for trading purposes

critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  accounting for inventories at the lower of cost or market  accounting for goodwill and intangible assets in business combinations  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  accounting for legal contingencies  accounting for pension benefits  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is determinable  and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize product revenues at the point of shipment or delivery in accordance with the terms of sale 
sales are net of returns and allowances 
returns and allowances are not significant because products are manufactured to customer specification and are covered by the terms of the product warranty 
revenues and profits on fixed price contracts with significant engineering as well as production requirements are recorded based on the achievement of contractual milestones and the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to total estimated costs for each contract cost to cost method in accordance with asc  formerly the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we review cost performance and estimates to complete on our ongoing contracts at least quarterly 
the impact of revisions of profit estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period they become evident 
amounts representing contract change orders are included in revenue only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable  and are determined on a percentage of completion basis measured by the cost to cost method 
claims are included in revenue only when they are probable of collection 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses expected to be incurred on accounts receivable balances 
judgment is required in estimation of the allowance and is based upon specific identification  collection history and creditworthiness of the debtor 
inventories we account for inventories on a first in  first out or average cost method of accounting at the lower of its cost or market 
the determination of market requires judgment in estimating future demand  selling prices and cost of disposal 
judgment is required when determining inventory reserves 
these reserves are provided when inventory is considered to be excess or obsolete based upon an analysis of actual on hand quantities on a part level basis to forecasted product demand and historical usage 
inventory reserves are released based upon shipment or disposal of the related inventory 
goodwill and intangible assets in business combinations we account for business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with asc  formerly financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  statement no 
and asc  formerly financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  statement no 

asc specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
we are also required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  including a significant sustained decline in an entity s market value  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business  or other factors 
goodwill is tested for impairment in a two step process 
the first step step one of the goodwill impairment test involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit 
fair value fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or incurred or sold or settled in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced liquidation sale 
a reporting unit is generally defined at the operating segment level or at the component level one level below the operating segment  if said component constitutes a business 
the fair value of a reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value  which is defined as the book basis of total assets less total liabilities 
in the event a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value  evidence of potential impairment exists 
in such a case  the second step step two of the impairment test is required  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  with the excess of fair value over allocated net assets representing the fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill 
as we have grown through acquisitions  we have accumulated million of goodwill and million of indefinite lived intangible assets out of total assets of billion at october  the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
we performed our impairment review for fiscal as of august   and our step one analysis indicates that no impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived assets exists at any of our reporting units except for a trade name of a certain subsidiary 
management determined that the trade name useful life was no longer indefinite as a result of further integration of advanced sensors units and promotion of the advanced sensors brand name 
an impairment test was required to be performed to value the trade name at fair value  which resulted in the impairment charge of million 
the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows  discount rates and estimated product life cycles 
in making these judgments  we evaluate the financial health of the business  including such factors as industry performance  changes in technology and operating cash flows 
we used available market data and a discounted cash flow analysis in completing our annual impairment test 
we believe that our cash flow estimates are reasonable based upon the historical cash flows and future operating and strategic plans of our reporting units 
in addition to cash flow estimates  our valuations are sensitive to the rate used to discount cash flows and future growth assumptions 
a change in the discount rate used in the cash flow analysis would result in a change in the fair value of our reporting units of approximately million 
a change in the growth rate assumed in the calculation of the terminal value of cash flows would result in a change in the fair value of our reporting units by million 
none of these changes would have resulted in any of our reporting units to be impaired 
impairment of long lived assets we account for the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used in accordance with asc  formerly financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  statement no 

long lived assets that are to be disposed of are required to be reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
an asset other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
in the event the carrying amount of such asset is not deemed recoverable  the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value 
fair value is generally determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 
as we have grown through acquisitions  we have accumulated million of definite lived intangible assets 
the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
contingencies we are party to various lawsuits and claims  both as plaintiff and defendant  and have contingent liabilities arising from the conduct of business 
we are covered by insurance for general liability  product liability  workers compensation and certain environmental exposures  subject to certain deductible limits 
we are self insured for amounts less than our deductible and where no insurance is available 
asc  formerly financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
pension and other post retirement benefits we account for employee pension and post retirement benefit costs in accordance with asc  formerly statement of financial accounting standards board no 
  and we select appropriate assumptions including discount rate  rate of increase in future compensation levels and assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and expected annual increases in costs of medical and other health care benefits in regard to our post retirement benefit obligations 
our assumptions are based upon historical results  the current economic environment and reasonable expectations of future events 
actual results which vary from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  accordingly  are recognized in expense in these periods 
significant differences between our assumptions and actual experience or significant changes in assumptions could impact the pension costs and the pension obligation 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  formerly financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  and fin  accounting for uncertainties in income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued asc  formerly financial accounting standard no 
 fasb accounting standards codification codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
asc 
the purpose of the codification is to provide a single source of authoritative us gaap 
the company adopted asc in the fourth quarter of the adoption of asc did not affect the company s financial statements  however  it did impact how the authoritative references are disclosed by referencing the applicable codification section 
on december   the financial accounting standards board issued asc  formerly financial accounting standard no 
r  business combinations  asc and asc  formerly financial accounting standard no 
 accounting and reporting of non controlling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
 asc 
these new standards will significantly change the accounting for and reporting of business combination transactions and non controlling minority interests in consolidated financial statements 
asc and asc are required to be adopted simultaneously and are effective for fiscal the significant changes in the accounting for business combination transactions under asc include recognition  with certain exceptions  of of the fair values of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and non controlling interests of acquired businesses 
measurement of all acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination at fair value on the acquisition date 
with the effectiveness of asc  the agreement and announcement date measurement principles will be nullified 
recognition of contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair values  with subsequent changes in fair value generally reflected in earnings 
with the one exception described in the last sentence of this section  recognition of pre acquisition gain and loss contingencies at their acquisition date fair values 
subsequent accounting for pre acquisition loss contingencies is based on the greater of acquisition date fair value or the amount calculated pursuant to asc  formerly financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for contingencies  asc 
subsequent accounting for pre acquisition gain contingencies is based on the lesser of acquisition date fair value or the best estimate of the future settlement amount 
adjustments after the acquisition date are made only upon the receipt of new information on the possible outcome of the contingency  and changes to the measurement of pre acquisition contingencies are recognized in ongoing results of operations 
absent new information  no adjustments to the acquisition date fair value are made until the contingency is resolved 
pre acquisition contingencies that are both non contractual and as of the acquisition date are not more likely than not of materializing are not recognized in acquisition accounting and  instead  are accounted for based on the guidance in asc  accounting for contingencies 
capitalization of in process research and development ipr d assets acquired at acquisition date fair value 
after acquisition  apply the indefinite lived impairment model lower of basis or fair value through the development period to capitalized ipr d without amortization 
charge development costs incurred after acquisition to results of operations 
upon completion of a successful development project  assign an estimated useful life to the amount then capitalized  amortize over that life  and consider the asset a definite lived asset for impairment accounting purposes 
recognition of acquisition related transaction costs as expense when incurred 
recognition of acquisition related restructuring cost accruals in acquisition accounting only if the criteria are met as of the acquisition date 
with the effectiveness of asc  the concepts of assessing  formulating  finalizing and committing communicating that currently pertain to recognition in purchase accounting of an acquisition related restructuring plan will be nullified 
recognition of changes in the acquirer s income tax valuation allowance resulting from the business combination separately from the business combination as adjustments to income tax expense 
also  changes after the acquisition date in an acquired entity s valuation allowance or tax uncertainty established at the acquisition date are accounted for as adjustments to income tax expense 
the adoption of asc is not expected to have a material effect on the date of adoption  however  the standard will have a significant effect on business combinations occurring after adoption of the standard
