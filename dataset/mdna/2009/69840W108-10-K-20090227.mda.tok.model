item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our revenues are derived from company owned bakery cafe sales  fresh dough sales to franchisees  and franchise royalties and fees 
fresh dough sales to franchisees are primarily the sales of dough products and sales of tuna and cream cheese to certain of our franchisees 
franchise royalties and fees include royalty income and franchise fees 
the cost of food and paper products  labor  occupancy  and other operating expenses relate primarily to company owned bakery cafe sales 
the cost of fresh dough sales to franchisees relates primarily to the sale of fresh dough products and tuna and cream cheese to franchisees 
general and administrative  depreciation and amortization  and pre opening expenses relate to all areas of revenue generation 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we changed the classification of certain amounts in costs and expenses between fresh dough cost of sales to franchisees and cost of food and paper products in the consolidated statements of operations 
we have reclassified prior period financial statements in order to conform to the current presentation 
these classification changes have no effect on previously reported operating profit 
our fiscal year ends on the last tuesday in december 
as a result  our fiscal year had weeks with the fourth quarter comprising weeks 
our and fiscal years each had weeks 
use of non gaap measurements we include in this report information on company owned  franchise operated and system wide comparable bakery cafe sales percentages 
company owned comparable bakery cafe sales percentages are based on sales from bakery cafes that have been in operation and company owned for at least months 
franchise operated comparable bakery cafe sales percentages are based on sales from franchised bakery cafes  as reported by franchisees  that have been in operation and franchise operated for at least months 
system wide comparable bakery cafe sales percentages are based on sales at both company owned and franchise operated bakery cafes 
comparable bakery cafe sales exclude closed locations and paradise bakery cafes 

table of contents comparable bakery cafe sales percentages are non gaap financial measures  which should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and may not be equivalent to comparable bakery cafe sales as defined or used by other companies 
we do not record franchise operated bakery cafe sales as revenues 
however  royalty revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchise operated bakery cafe sales  as reported by franchisees 
we use franchise operated and system wide sales information internally in connection with store development decisions  planning  and budgeting analyses 
we believe franchise operated and system wide sales information is useful in assessing consumer acceptance of our brand  facilitates an understanding of financial performance and the overall direction and trends of sales and operating income  helps us appreciate the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing initiatives to which our franchisees also contribute based on a percentage of their sales  and provides information that is relevant for comparison within the industry 
we also include in this report information on company owned  franchise operated and system wide average weekly sales 
average weekly sales is calculated by dividing total net sales by operating weeks 
accordingly  year over year results reflect sales for all locations  whereas comparable bakery cafe sales exclude closed locations and are based on sales for bakery cafes that have been in operation and owned for at least months 
new stores typically experience an opening honeymoon period during which they generate higher average weekly sales in the first to weeks they are open as customers settle in to normal usage patterns from initial trial of the location 
on average  the settle in experienced is percent to percent from the average weekly sales during the honeymoon period 
as a result  year over year results of average weekly sales are generally lower than the results in comparable bakery cafe sales 
this results from the relationship of the number of bakery cafes in the honeymoon phase  the number of bakery cafes in the settle in phase  and the number of bakery cafes in the comparable bakery cafe base

table of contents labor expense was million  or percent of bakery cafe sales in fiscal compared to million  or percent of bakery cafe sales  in fiscal the labor expense as a percentage of bakery cafe sales remained fairly consistent between the and fiscal years primarily as a result of the reduction in fixed labor costs from the removal of crispani from the bakery cafes in the first quarter of and leverage from higher sales prices  offset partially by labor inefficiencies resulting from lower transaction levels and a modest effect from higher self insured benefits expense and normalized incentive compensation levels in fiscal as compared to fiscal occupancy cost was million  or percent of bakery cafe sales  in fiscal compared to million  or percent of bakery cafe sales  in fiscal the increase in occupancy cost as a percentage of bakery cafe sales between the and fiscal years was primarily due to rising average per square foot costs driven by our expansion into newer  higher cost markets  such as those on the west coast  and  less significantly  due to the increasing numbers of urban  free standing and drive thru bakery cafe locations 
other operating expenses were million  or percent of bakery cafe sales  in fiscal compared to million  or percent of bakery cafe sales  in fiscal the decrease in other operating expenses rate between the and fiscal years was primarily due to improved leverage of our expenses due to higher sales coupled with disciplined management of controllable expenses  partially offset by a charge of million related to asset write offs involving our new coffee program

general and administrative expenses were million  or percent of total revenue  in fiscal compared to million  or percent of total revenue  in fiscal this consistency in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was primarily due to disciplined expense management and improved leverage of our expenses due to higher sales  which was partially offset by normalized incentive compensation expense and higher self insured benefits expense compared to the prior year  a charge of million related to severance  the write off of capitalized assets and overhead costs and the termination of leases for specific sites that we decided in the first quarter of to no longer develop in connection with the adjustment of our development plans  and a charge of million related to on going legal settlements

fresh dough sales to franchisees in fiscal increased percent to million compared to million in fiscal the increase in fresh dough sales to franchisees was primarily driven by the previously described increased number of franchise operated bakery cafes opened and the purchase of one bakery cafe from us since the prior fiscal year  partially offset by lower overall dough sales resulting from a shift in bakery cafe menu mix away from the bread and bagels we self manufacture in our fresh dough facilities

labor expense was million  or percent of bakery cafe sales  in fiscal compared to million  or percent of bakery cafe sales  in fiscal the labor expense as a percentage of bakery cafe sales increased between the and fiscal years primarily as a result of the additional labor required in our bakery cafes in support of our evening daypart initiative launched in the third quarter of fiscal  higher bakery cafe labor in conjunction with the roll out of certain operational improvement initiatives focusing on our lunch daypart  and general inflationary cost pressures  which outpaced the increase in sales prices over the same fiscal years

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to the adoption of fin no 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at december  as compared with million at december  this increase is primarily a result of the million of cash generated from operations  the million received from the exercise of employee stock options  and the million received in investment maturity proceeds during fiscal  partially offset by the million used to repay long term debt  the million used for capital expenditures  and the million used in share repurchases 
our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations  although we have also borrowed under a credit facility principally to finance repurchases of our common stock 
historically  our principal requirements for cash have primarily resulted from our capital expenditures for the development of new company owned bakery cafes  for maintaining or remodeling existing company owned bakery cafes  for purchasing existing franchise operated bakery cafes or ownership interests in other restaurant or bakery cafe concepts  for developing  maintaining or remodeling fresh dough facilities  and for other capital needs such as enhancements to information systems and other infrastructure 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to our credit facility and our share repurchase program  respectively 

table of contents we had net working capital of million at both december  and december  the consistency in working capital from december  to december  resulted primarily from a decrease in accrued expenses of million  an increase in prepaid expenses of million  an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million  and an increase in deferred taxes of million  offset by a decrease in short term investments of million and a decrease in trade and other accounts receivable of million 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our existing credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
a summary of our cash flows  for the periods indicated  is as follows in thousands for the fiscal year ended cash provided by used in december  december  december  operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities funds provided by operating activities in fiscal primarily resulted from net income  adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  deferred taxes  and the tax benefit from exercise of stock options  a decrease in trade and other accounts receivable  an increase in deferred rent  an increase in other long term liabilities and non acquisition accrued expenses  partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses

funds provided by operating activities in fiscal primarily resulted from net income  adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense  and a decrease in non acquisition accrued expenses  partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses 
investing activities capital expenditures are the largest ongoing component of our investing activities and include expenditures for new bakery cafes and fresh dough facilities  improvements to existing bakery cafes and fresh dough facilities  and other capital needs 
a summary of capital expenditures for the periods indicated consisted of the following in thousands for the fiscal year ended december  december  december  new bakery cafe and fresh dough facilities bakery cafe and fresh dough facility improvements other capital needs total our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening or acquisition of additional bakery cafes and fresh dough facilities and maintenance and remodel expenditures  have and will continue to be significant 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations  and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  as well as available borrowings under our existing credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we currently anticipate total capital expenditures for fiscal of approximately million  which consists of the following million related to the opening of to new company owned bakery cafes and the costs incurred on early openings  million related to the remodeling of existing bakery cafes  and million related to the remodeling and expansion of fresh dough facilities as well as other capital needs including expenditures on our concept  information technology  and infrastructure 
we expect future bakery cafes will require  on average  an investment per bakery cafe excluding pre opening expenses which are expensed as incurred of approximately million  which is net of landlord allowances and excludes capitalized development overhead 
our fiscal projection of capital expenditures for new company owned bakery cafes reflects our decision to reduce our bakery cafe growth in an effort to focus on our return on invested capital 
our strategy to improve return on invested capital includes raising our sales hurdles for new bakery cafes to adjust to the contraction in margins we have experienced 
we expect to do this by focusing our real estate decision making process to only build bakery cafes that can deliver a percent or greater probability against our revised return on investment goals and bakery cafes that reach mature returns in a shorter amount of time 
as margins improve and the rate of our return on invested capital improves  we will once again consider expanding development as appropriate

these investments are subject to credit  liquidity  market and interest rate risk 
for example  the columbia portfolio includes investments in certain asset backed securities and structured investment vehicles that are collateralized by sub prime mortgage securities or related to mortgage securities  among other assets 
as a result of adverse market conditions that have unfavorably affected the fair value and liquidity of collateral underlying the columbia portfolio  it was overwhelmed with withdrawal requests from investors and the columbia portfolio was closed with a restriction placed upon the cash redemption ability of its holders in the fourth quarter of we assessed the fair value of the underlying collateral for the columbia portfolio through review of current investment ratings  as available  coupled with the evaluation of the liquidation value of assets held by each investment and their subsequent distribution of cash 
we then utilized this assessment of the underlying collateral from multiple indicators of fair value  which were then adjusted to reflect the expected timing of disposition and market risks to arrive at an estimated fair value of the columbia portfolio units of per unit  or million  as of december  and per unit  or million  as of december  during fiscal  we received million of cash redemptions at an average net asset value of per unit  which we classified as investment maturity proceeds provided by investing activities 
in total  we recognized a net realized and unrealized loss on the columbia portfolio units of million in fiscal related to the fair value measurements and redemptions received and included the net loss in net cash provided by operating activities 
information and the markets relating to these investments remain dynamic  and there may be further declines in the value of these investments  the value of the collateral held by these entities  and the liquidity of our investments 
to the extent we determine there is a further decline in fair value  we may recognize additional realized and or unrealized losses in future periods up to the aggregate amount of these investments 
between december  and february   we received an additional million of cash redemptions of columbia portfolio units at an average net asset value of per unit 
we have included million of the remaining units of the columbia portfolio in short term investments in our consolidated financial statements at december   as we reasonably believe this amount of redemptions will be received within the next twelve months based on the redemptions received to date and recent representations from the columbia portfolio management 
however  the columbia portfolio has not made any formal commitments on the availability or timing of future redemptions 
the remaining million of the columbia portfolio units have been classified as long term investments in our consolidated financial statements at december  during the fiscal  we received million of cash redemptions at an average net asset value of subsequent to the withdrawal restriction  which we classified as investment maturity proceeds provided by investing activities 
in total  we recognized a net realized and unrealized loss on the columbia portfolio units of million in fiscal related to the fair value measurements and redemptions received and included the net loss in net cash provided by operating activities 
during fiscal  we had no investments in united states treasury notes and government agency securities  and we made no additional purchases of investments 
during fiscal  the million of investments in government securities outstanding as of december  matured or were called by the issuer and we did not purchase any additional investments in government securities 
during fiscal  we purchased million of investments in government securities and million of investments in government securities matured or were called by the issuer 
we recognized interest income on investments in government securities of million during fiscal and million during fiscal this interest income includes premium amortization of million in fiscal and discount amortization of million in fiscal  and is classified in other income expense  net in our consolidated financial statements

these share repurchases were not made pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs 
on march   we  and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries  as guarantors  entered into an amended and restated credit agreement  referred to as the amended and restated credit agreement  with bank of america  na  and other lenders party thereto to amend and restate in its entirety our credit agreement  dated as of november   by and among us  bank of america  na  and the lenders party thereto  referred to as the original credit agreement 
pursuant to a request by us under the terms of the original credit agreement  the amended and restated credit agreement increases the size of our secured revolving credit facility from million to million 
we may select interest rates equal to a the base rate which is defined as the higher of bank of america prime rate and the federal funds rate plus percent  or b libor plus an applicable rate  ranging from percent to percent  based on our consolidated leverage ratio  as each term is defined in the amended and restated credit agreement 
the amended and restated credit agreement allows us from time to time to request that the credit facility be further increased by an amount not to exceed  in the aggregate  million  subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent 
the amended and restated credit agreement contains financial covenants that  among other things  require the maintenance of certain leverage and fixed charges coverage ratios 
the credit facility  which is secured by the capital stock of our present and future material subsidiaries  will become due on march   subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of defaults  including breaches of representations or covenants  failure to pay other material indebtedness or a change of control of our company  as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement 
the proceeds from the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures  and permitted acquisitions and share repurchases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to the credit facility 

table of contents critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions  which we believe to be reasonable  based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
variances in the estimates or assumptions used could yield materially different accounting results 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances 
we have chosen accounting policies we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
we consider our policies on accounting for revenue recognition  valuation of goodwill  self insurance  income taxes  lease obligations  and stock based compensation to be the most critical in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
there have been no material changes to our application of critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates since december  revenue recognition we recognize revenue from bakery cafe sales upon delivery of the related food and other products to the customer 
revenue from fresh dough sales to franchisees is also recorded upon delivery of fresh dough to franchisees 
also  a liability is recorded in the period in which a gift card is issued and proceeds are received 
as gift cards are redeemed  this liability is reduced and revenue is recognized as a sale 
further  franchise fees are the result of the sale of area development rights and the sale of individual franchise locations to third parties 
the initial franchise fee is generally  per bakery cafe to be developed under the area development agreement  or ada 
of this fee   is generally paid at the time of signing of the ada and is recognized as revenue when it is received as it is non refundable and we have to perform no other service to earn this fee 
the remainder of the fee is paid at the time an individual franchise agreement is signed and is recognized as revenue upon the opening of the bakery cafe 
royalties are generally paid weekly based on a percentage of sales specified in each ada generally percent to percent of sales 
royalties are recognized as revenue when they are earned 
valuation of goodwill we record goodwill related to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
at december  and december   our goodwill balance was million and million  respectively 
goodwill is subject to periodic evaluation for impairment when circumstances warrant  or at least once per year 
we perform our annual impairment assessment as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year 
impairment is tested in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  by comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
as there are not quoted prices for our reporting units  fair value is estimated based upon a present value technique using estimated discounted future cash flows  forecasted over the reasonably assured lease term for bakery cafes and fresh dough facilities  with growth rates forecasted for the reporting units and using a credit adjusted discount rate 
we use current results  trends  future prospects  and other economic factors as the basis for expected future cash flows 
assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
we make every effort to forecast these future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed 
however  changes in the assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of goodwill  and could result in additional impairment charges in future periods 
factors that have the potential to create variances between forecasted cash flows and actual results include but are not limited to i fluctuations in sales volumes  ii commodity costs  such as wheat and fuel  and iii acceptance of our pricing actions undertaken in response to rapidly changing commodity prices and other product costs 
refer to forward looking statements included in the beginning of our fiscal form k for further information regarding the impact of estimates of future cash flows 
the calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used  such as changes in the financial performance of the reporting units  future growth rate  and discount rate 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical decrease in cash flows  and made changes to our projected growth rate and discount rate which we believe our considered appropriate 
based on the goodwill analysis performed as of september   the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter  the outlined changes in our assumptions would not affect the results of the impairment test  as all markets still have an excess of fair value over the carrying value 

table of contents while we currently believe that the fair value of both reporting units exceeds carrying value under the discounted cash flow model  there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
as of december   we determined there was no impairment of goodwill 
self insurance we are self insured for a significant portion of our workers compensation  group health  and general  auto  and property liability insurance with varying levels of deductibles of as much as million of individual claims  depending on the type of claim 
we also purchase aggregate stop loss and or layers of loss insurance in many categories of loss 
we utilize third party actuarial experts estimates of expected losses based on statistical analyses of historical industry data  as well as our own estimates based on our actual historical data to determine required self insurance reserves 
the assumptions are closely reviewed  monitored  and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be affected if actual experience related to the number of claims and cost per claim differs from these assumptions and historical trends 
based on information known at december   we believe we have provided adequate reserves for our self insurance exposure 
as of december  and december   self insurance reserves were million and million  respectively  and were included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and canada 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin no 
 which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  the refinement of an estimate or changes in tax laws 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
the provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
lease obligations we lease all of our bakery cafe and fresh dough facility properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 

table of contents for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  and record the difference between the minimum rent paid and the straight line rent as a lease obligation 
many of our leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon bakery cafe sales volume contingent rent 
contingent rent is accrued each period as the liability is incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
this results in variability in occupancy expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in bakery cafes where we pay contingent rent 
in addition  we record landlord allowances for non structural tenant improvements as deferred rent  which is included in accrued expenses or deferred rent in the consolidated balance sheets based on their short term or long term nature 
these landlord allowances are amortized over the reasonably assured lease term as a reduction of rent expense 
also  leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related reasonably assured lease term 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each bakery cafe and fresh dough facility is amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires us to measure and record compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements for all stock based compensation awards using a fair value method 
we maintain several stock based incentive plans under which we may grant incentive stock options and non statutory stock options for a fixed number of shares to certain directors  officers  employees and consultants with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant 
we also may grant restricted stock and restricted stock units with fair value determined based on our closing stock price on the date of grant 
in addition  we offer a stock purchase plan where employees may purchase our common stock each calendar quarter through payroll deductions at percent of market value on the purchase date and we recognize compensation expense on the percent discount 
for stock options  fair value is determined using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the following expected term the expected term of the option awards represents the period of time between the grant date of the option awards and the date the option awards are either exercised or canceled  including an estimate for those option awards still outstanding  and is derived from historical terms and other factors 
expected volatility the expected volatility is based on an average of the historical volatility of our stock price  for a period approximating the expected term  and the implied volatility of externally traded options of our stock that were entered into during the period 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant and with a maturity that approximates the options expected term 
dividend yield the dividend yield is based on our anticipated dividend payout over the expected term of the option award 
additionally  we use historical experience to estimate the expected forfeiture rate in determining the stock based compensation expense for these awards 
changes in these assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of the awards is amortized over the vesting period 
options and restricted stock generally vest ratably over a four year period beginning two years from the date of grant and options generally have a six year term 
contractual obligations and other commitments we currently anticipate total capital expenditures for fiscal of approximately million  which consists of the following million related to the opening of to new company owned bakery cafes and the costs incurred on early openings  million related to the remodeling of existing bakery cafes  and million related to the remodeling and expansion of fresh dough facilities as well as other capital needs including expenditures on our concept  information technology  and infrastructure 
we expect future bakery cafes will require  on average  an investment per bakery cafe excluding pre opening expenses which are expensed as incurred of approximately million  which is net of landlord allowances and excludes capitalized development overhead 
we expect to fund these expenditures principally through internally generated cash flow and available borrowings under our existing credit facility 

table of contents in addition to our planned capital expenditure requirements  we have certain other contractual and committed cash obligations 
our contractual cash obligations consist of noncancelable operating leases for our bakery cafes  fresh dough facilities and trucks and administrative offices  purchase obligations primarily for certain commodities  and uncertain tax positions 
lease terms for our trucks are generally for six to eight years 
lease terms for our bakery cafes  fresh dough facilities  and administrative offices are generally for ten years with renewal options at most locations and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area  and other operating costs 
many bakery cafe leases provide for contingent rental ie percentage rent payments based on sales in excess of specified amounts 
certain of our lease agreements provide for scheduled rent increases during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy 
as of december   we expect cash expenditures under these lease obligations  purchase obligations  and uncertain tax positions to be as follows for the fiscal periods indicated in thousands total in after operating leases purchase obligations uncertain tax positions total see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to our operating leases 
relates to certain commodity and service agreements where we are committed as of december  to purchase a fixed quantity over a contracted time period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to our uncertain tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangement we account for certain guarantees in accordance with fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
we have guaranteed operating leases of franchisee locations  and locations of its former au bon pain division  or its franchisees 
also  our percent owned paradise subsidiary has guaranteed nine operating leases on behalf of its franchisees 
these leases have terms expiring on various dates from january  to december  and have a potential amount of future rental payments of approximately million as of december  the obligation from these leases will generally continue to decrease over time as these operating leases expire 
we have not recorded a liability for certain of these guarantees as they arose prior to the adoption of fin no 
and  unless modified  are exempt from its requirements 
there is no liability reflected for those guarantees issued after fin no 
s effective date as the fair value determined by the our analysis of each lease guarantee and the facts and circumstances of the lease and the franchisee performance was insignificant  and we did not believe it was probable we would be required to perform under any guarantees at the time the guarantee was issued 
we have not had to make any payments related to any of these guaranteed leases 
au bon pain or the applicable franchisees continue to have primary liability for these operating leases 
future commitments as of december  under these leases were as follows in thousands total in after subleases and lease guarantees represents aggregate minimum requirement see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to our operating leases 
we have confidential and proprietary information and non competition agreements  referred to as non compete agreements  with certain employees 
these non compete agreements contain a provision whereby employees would be due a certain number of weeks of their salary if their employment was terminated by us as specified in the non compete agreement 
we have not recorded a liability for these amounts potentially due employees 
rather  we will record a liability for these amounts when an amount becomes due to an employee in accordance with the appropriate authoritative literature 
as of december   the total amount potentially owed employees under these non compete agreements was million 

table of contents in order to facilitate our opening of the first panera bread bakery cafes in canada  on september   our canadian subsidiary  panera bread ulc  as lender  entered into a cdn 
million secured revolving credit facility agreement with millennium bread inc  referred to as millennium  as borrower  and certain of its present and future subsidiaries  which we refer to as franchisee guarantors  who have entered into franchise agreements with panera bread ulc to operate three panera bread bakery cafes in canada 
advances under the credit agreement are subject to a number of pre conditions  including a requirement that millennium must have first received and maintained a certain level of cash equity contributions or subordinated loans from millennium s shareholders in relation to the amount of advances requested by millennium under the credit agreement 
the borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at the per annum rate of percent  calculated daily and payable monthly in arrears on the last business day of each of panera bread ulc s fiscal month 
the credit facility  which is collateralized by present and future property and assets of millennium and the franchisee guarantors  as well as the personal guarantees of certain individuals  will become due on september   subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of default  including breaches of representations or covenants  failure to pay other material indebtedness or a change of control of millennium  as defined in the credit agreement 
the proceeds from the credit facility may be used by millennium to pay costs and expenses to develop and construct the franchisee guarantors bakery cafes and for their day to day operating requirements 
as of december   there were no outstanding advances under the credit agreement 
as part of the franchise agreement between millennium and panera bread ulc  panera bread ulc will develop and equip the bakery cafe as a typical panera bread bakery cafe in accordance with its then current design and construction standards and specifications as applied by us to the bakery cafe  in our sole discretion 
millennium will pay us an amount equal to the total cost of development of the bakery cafe  which includes any and all costs and expenses incurred by us in connection with selection and development of the bakery cafe  however  no overhead expenses of ours other than the development fee shall be included in total cost 
we will deliver possession of the bakery cafe to millennium when the bakery cafe is substantially complete  including issuance of a certificate of occupancy  and millennium will open the bakery cafe for business with the public as soon as practicable following the date of delivery of possession of the bakery cafe 
on september  and october   we delivered possession of the first two panera bread bakery cafes in canada to millennium  which subsequently opened on october  and november   respectively 
we delivered possession of the third bakery cafe on december   which opened on january  during our first quarter of fiscal as of december   we had a million receivable from millennium included in other accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets representing the total cost of the three bakery cafes development 
we expect settlement of this receivable to be substantially funded by the use of the credit agreement previously described and cash payments in fiscal under the february  agreement to purchase percent of the outstanding stock of paradise  we have the right to purchase the remaining percent of the outstanding stock of paradise after january  at a contractually determined value  which approximates current fair value 
also  if we do not exercise our right to purchase the remaining percent of the outstanding stock of paradise by june   the remaining paradise owners have the right to purchase our percent ownership interest in paradise after june  for million 
impact of inflation our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food  supply  labor  occupancy and other costs 
in the past  we have been able to recover a significant portion of inflationary costs and commodity price increases  including  among other things  fuel  proteins  dairy  wheat  tuna  and cream cheese costs  through increased menu prices 
there have been  and there may be in the future  delays in implementing such menu price increases  and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in their entirety 
historically  the effects of inflation on our net income have not been materially adverse 
however  the volatility recently experienced in fiscal in certain commodity markets  such as those for wheat  fuel  and proteins  such as chicken or turkey  may have a continued adverse effect on us in fiscal the extent of the impact will depend on our ability and timing to increase food prices 
a majority of our associates are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
although we have and will continue to attempt to pass along any increased labor costs through food price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increased labor costs can be reflected in our prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by consumers without diminishing to some degree consumer spending at the bakery cafes 
however  we have not experienced to date a significant reduction in bakery cafe profit margins as a result of changes in such laws  and management does not anticipate any related future significant reductions in gross profit margins 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas no 
r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  any business combinations we engage in will be recorded and disclosed following the new standard beginning december  we expect sfas no 
r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions consummated after the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb sfas no 
changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests 
minority interests will be recorded initially at fair market value and will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity  and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions 
in addition  net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and upon a loss of control  the interest sold  as well as any interest retained  will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which will apply retrospectively

 determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
fsp sfas no 
amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
previously  under the provisions of sfas no 
 an entity was precluded from using its own assumptions about renewal or extension of an arrangement where there was likely to be substantial cost or material modifications 
fsp sfas no 
removes the requirement of sfas no 
for an entity to consider whether an intangible asset can be renewed without substantial cost or material modification to the existing terms and conditions and requires an entity to consider its own experience in renewing similar arrangements 
fsp sfas no 
also increases the disclosure requirements for a recognized intangible asset to enable a user of financial statements to assess the extent to which the expected future cash flows associated with the asset are affected by the entity s intent or ability to renew or extend the arrangement 
fsp sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is prohibited 
the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset is applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
accordingly  we do not anticipate that the initial application of fsp sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we expect fsp sfas no 
will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions consummated after the effective date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk we manage our commodity risk in several ways 
on occasion  we have entered into swap agreements to manage our fluctuating butter prices 
all derivative instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes 
in fiscal and  we did not have any derivative instruments 
in addition  we purchase certain commodities  such as flour  coffee and proteins  for use in our business 
these commodities are sometimes purchased under agreements of one month to one year time frames usually at a fixed price 
as a result  we are subject to market risk that current market prices may be above or below our contractual price 
interest rate sensitivity we are also exposed to market risk primarily from fluctuations in interest rates on our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility provides for a million secured facility under which we may select interest rates equal to the base rate which is defined as the higher of the bank of america prime rate and the federal funds rate plus percent or libor plus an applicable rate ranging from percent to percent as set forth in the amended and restated credit agreement 
we did not have an outstanding balance on our borrowings at december  we may have future borrowings under our credit facility  which could result in an interest rate change that may have an impact on our results of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we expanded our operations into canadian markets by opening two franchise operated bakery cafes 
our operating expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar  in which our operating obligations in canada are paid 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging contracts  although we may do so in the future 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect our business in the future
