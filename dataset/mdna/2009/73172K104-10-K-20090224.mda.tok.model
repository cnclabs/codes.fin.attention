overview we are a leading global provider of high quality  easy to use communications solutions that enable enterprise and public sector customers to more effectively collaborate over distance  time zones and organizational boundaries 
our solutions are built on architectures that enable unified voice  video and content collaboration 
our offerings are organized in three segments video solutions  voice communications solutions and services 
important drivers for polycom products in the current economy are the need for companies to reduce costs and travel expenses while increasing their productivity and quickly achieving returns on their investments roi 
with the globalization of the enterprise  polycom technology especially our high definition telepresence and video conferencing solutions is redefining the way organizations are able to communicate and thus achieve their goals 
customers are also looking to polycom for solutions that can help them to meet their goals regarding green initiatives and to comply with mandates to reduce their corporate carbon footprint 
we believe the demand for solutions to meet these core business initiatives will increase over the next decade 
the shift from circuit switched telephony networks to internet protocol ip based networks is enabling new technologies and continues to be a significant driver for polycom s collaborative communications markets and for our business 
high definition hd voice  video  and content is another key driver for polycom 
this 
table of contents significant improvement in quality provided by hd is enabling telepresence and other communications models that we believe approximate in person communications 
strategically  polycom is investing most of its research  development  sales  and marketing efforts into delivering a superior ip based  hd collaborative communications solution  using polycom proprietary technology in the evolving  standards based ip communications environment 
our goal is to deliver best of breed hd collaborative communications solutions that integrate into any call management system or unified communications environment 
revenues were billion in  an increase of over revenues of million 
the increase in revenues primarily reflects increased sales volumes of our video solutions and voice communications solutions products and  to a lesser extent  increases in service revenues 
in  excluding the impact of the spectralink acquisition on growth rates  we experienced slower growth than in  particularly in north america and our voice product lines due in part to the global economic conditions  as well as increased competition 
in the fourth quarter of  our total net revenues declined by sequentially from the third quarter of and were essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter of  while north america experienced sequential and year over year declines of and  respectively  and our worldwide voice product revenues declined by sequentially and year over year 
our video solutions  voice communications solutions and services segment revenues grew  and  respectively  over  and accounted for  and  respectively  of our revenues in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our segments  including a summary of our segment revenues  segment contribution margin  segment inventory and revenue by geography 
we believe our voice communications solutions products are more susceptible to general economic conditions than our other products  which has lead to longer sales cycles for our voice products and in the fourth quarter of we experienced year over year declines in voice product revenues 
in particular  while we believe that our video product lines may be better able to sustain the impact of current economic conditions and recessionary and other factors  our voice products do not provide the same return on investment profile that we believe our video products provide to customers who are curtailing travel and other related expenditures in a down economy  making our voice products more susceptible to the current economic downturn 
further  although we believe our video solutions products offer a rapid return on investment  tightened corporate budgets and capital expenditures in this economic environment will likely negatively impact our video solutions product revenues 
gross margins decreased in over primarily as a result of acquisition related charges related to the spectralink acquisition  such as amortization of purchased intangibles and decreased margins on our voice communications solutions products due to a shift in product mix toward lower margin voip and wireless products and hdx and rpx products and away from higher margin infrastructure products 
these effects were partially offset by increased margins on our services revenues 
operating margins increased in over primarily as a result of cost control measures implemented during the fourth quarter of from time to time  in order to control operating expenses in any given quarter  we may take actions to reduce costs such as delay or limit the scope of marketing programs and other projects  impose travel restrictions  request employees to use paid time off or implement other cost control measures 
we may also periodically benefit from one time expense adjustments 
during the fourth quarter of  operating expenses decreased sequentially from the third quarter of by approximately million  including approximately million related to cost control measures  approximately million in stock based compensation expense and approximately million from the benefit of one time expense adjustments 
during  we generated approximately million in cash flow from operating activities which  after the impact of investing  share repurchases and other financing activities described in further detail under liquidity and capital resources  resulted in a million net decrease in our total cash and cash equivalents 

table of contents on january   we completed our acquisition of destiny conferencing corporation  or destiny 
destiny designed and manufactured immersive telepresence solutions 
polycom incorporated destiny s products into its rpx telepresence offering prior to the acquisition under the terms of an oem distribution agreement between the companies 
these products also became the foundation for our tpx telepresence offering 
as a result of the acquisition  we now own several patents core to telepresence 
destiny s results of operations are included in our results of operations as part of our video solutions and services segments from january   the date of acquisition 
on march   we completed our acquisition of spectralink corporation 
spectralink designs  manufactures and sells on premises wireless telephone products to customers worldwide that complement existing telephone systems by providing mobile communications in a building or campus environment 
spectralink wireless telephone products increase the efficiency of employees by enabling them to remain in telephone contact while moving throughout the workplace 
we believe that the spectralink acquisition positions us as the only independent provider of both fixed and mobile solutions that seamlessly encompass voice  video and data collaboration solutions from the desktop  to the meeting room  to the mobile individual 
spectralink s results of operations are included in our results of operations as part of our voice communications solutions and services segments from march   the date of acquisition

the increase in revenues primarily reflects increased sales volumes of our video solutions and voice communications solutions products and  to a lesser extent  an increase in service revenues 

table of contents revenues from our wireless voice products acquired in the spectralink acquisition accounted for approximately million of the year over year increase and are included in the voice communications solutions and services segments 
video solutions segment revenues include revenues from sales of our video communications and infrastructure product lines 
revenue from video communications products increased to million for from million in  an increase  primarily due to an increase in sales volumes and average selling prices of our group video products  which consisted primarily of our vsx and hdx product families

infrastructure product revenues were essentially flat 
video solutions segment revenues include revenues from sales of our video communications and infrastructure product lines 
revenue from video communications products increased to million for from million in  a increase  primarily due to an increase in sales volumes and average selling prices of our group video products  which consisted primarily of our vsx and hdx product families 
revenues from our infrastructure products for were million  essentially flat compared to revenues of million  due primarily to increases in revenues from our video infrastructure and software product sales being substantially offset by decreases in our voice infrastructure revenues 
infrastructure product revenues were impacted by a decrease in video infrastructure product average selling prices  due in part to increased competition 
voice communications solutions product revenues increased primarily as a result of revenues from our wireless voice products acquired in the spectralink acquisition  as well as increases in sales volumes of our voice over ip and circuit switched products 
services revenues increased primarily due to increases in voice related services as a result of the acquired spectralink product lines  as well as increased video related services and video infrastructure services

table of contents in  one channel partner accounted for of our video solutions segment revenues 
no one channel partner accounted for more than of our total net revenues or of our voice communications solutions or services segment revenues in in  no one channel partner accounted for more than of our total net revenues or of our video solutions  voice communications solutions or services segment revenues 
in  one channel partner accounted for of our total net revenues and of our video solutions segment revenues 
no one channel partner accounted for more than of our voice communications solutions or services segment revenues in we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any of our channel partners would have a long term material adverse effect on our consolidated net revenues or segment net revenues as we believe end users would likely purchase our products from a different channel partner 
however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period 
we also sell our voice infrastructure products directly to end users and the revenues in the video solutions segment from end users are subject to more variability than our revenues from our reseller customers 
we typically ship products within a short time after we receive an order and  therefore  backlog is not necessarily a good indicator of future revenues 
as of december   we had million of order backlog as compared to million at december  we include in backlog open product orders which we expect to ship or services which we expect to bill and record revenue for in the following quarter 
once billed  unrecorded service revenue is included in deferred revenue 
we believe that the current level of backlog will continue to fluctuate primarily as a result of the level and timing of orders received and customer delivery dates requested outside of the quarter 
the level of backlog at any given time is also dependent in part on our ability to forecast revenue mix and plan our manufacturing accordingly and ongoing service deferrals as service revenues increase as a percent of total revenue 
in addition  orders from our channel partners are based in part on the level of demand from end user customers 
any decline or uncertainty in end user demand could negatively impact end user orders  which in turn could negatively affect orders from our channel partners in any given quarter 
as a result  our backlog could decline from current levels

generally  video solutions segment products have a higher gross margin than products in our voice communications solutions segment 

table of contents overall  product gross margins decreased by percentage point in as compared to which is due in part to an increase in the amortization of core and existing technology purchased intangibles as a result of the spectralink acquisition that we completed at the end of the first quarter of and to a shift in product mix toward lower margin voice over ip  hdx and rpx products and away from higher margin infrastructure products  which was partially offset by a decrease in the impact of purchase accounting adjustments for the write up of certain inventory to its fair value at the time of the spectralink acquisition  which resulted in higher product costs being recorded for certain inventory sold in the first half of excluding costs which are not allocated to our segments  such as amortization of purchased intangibles  stock based compensation expense and fair value adjustments to inventory related to acquisition accounting  gross margins decreased slightly in our video solutions and voice communications solutions segments in compared to gross margins in our services segment increased slightly in compared to the fluctuation in these segments gross margin was primarily due to changes in product mix 
video solutions gross margins were negatively impacted by the decrease in revenues from our voice infrastructure products  which typically have higher gross margins than our video communications products 
the lower video solutions gross margin was also due to lower video communications product gross margins attributable in part to new video product offerings  which typically have lower gross margins for a period of time after their introduction due to higher component costs  the technological complexity of the newer products and lower initial production volumes 
we have a number of initiatives focused on value engineering the design of certain of our hdx products  which we began to see positively impact our gross margins in the third quarter of value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through activities such as component redesign  board configuration  test processes  and transformation processes 
we have launched a number of new products in recent quarters  including additional products in our hdx and rpx product lines  and newer products are becoming an increasing percentage of our revenues 
for example  the hdx and rpx products accounted for almost half of our video communications product revenues in as compared to approximately in our voice over ip handset products and the wireless products we acquired from spectralink have a lower gross margin than the consolidated gross margin of our other voice communications products 
the change in mix toward our voice over ip products  together with the increase in wireless product revenues  resulted in lower voice communications solutions gross margins during depending upon the product mix and sales volumes  voice communications solutions gross margins could be lower in the future 
overall  product gross margins decreased by percentage points in as compared to which is due in part to the amortization of core and existing technology purchased intangibles as a result of our recent acquisitions and increased stock based compensation costs 
in addition  cost of product revenues increased as a result of the write up of inventory to its fair value at the time of the acquisitions 
these increased costs  which are not allocated to our segments  accounted for approximately percentage points of the decrease in gross margin in excluding these unallocated costs  gross margins decreased in both our video solutions and voice communications solutions segments in versus the comparable period 
the fluctuation in these segments gross margin was primarily due to changes in product mix 
our voice over ip handset products and the wireless products we acquired from spectralink have a lower gross margin than the consolidated gross margin of our other voice communications products which resulted in lower gross margins during  and depending upon the product mix could result in lower voice communications solutions gross margins in the future 
our gross margins on our wireless products were also negatively impacted by changes in our distribution model whereby we transitioned certain direct customers and resellers to purchase from our distributors and this negative impact may continue 
the decrease in gross margins in our video solutions segment was primarily due to decreased margins on our video infrastructure products as a result of decreased average selling prices  substantially offset by higher gross margins on our group video systems 
our december  finished goods inventory levels were significantly higher than the december  levels primarily as a result of lower revenues than planned  the difference in planned versus actual sales mix of products  as well as weaker revenue linearity and other factors that we experienced in the first quarter of however  our inventory levels have decreased sequentially since march  and inventory turns 
table of contents have remained flat or improved slightly each quarter 
we will continue to monitor our inventory levels closely as we take actions that we expect will have the impact of reducing inventory and improving our inventory turns in the coming quarters 
inventory levels and associated inventory turns in the future will fluctuate depending upon a number of factors  including the differences in planned versus actual sales mix  an increase in the inventory purchases transported via ocean freight versus air freight and other factors 
forecasting future product gross margin percentages is difficult  and there are a number of risks related to our ability to maintain or improve our current gross margin levels 
uncertainties surrounding revenue levels  including future potential discounts as a result of the economy or in response to the strengthening of the us dollar in our international markets  and related production level variances  competition  changes in technology  changes in product mix  variability of stock based compensation costs  and the potential of resulting royalties to third parties  manufacturing efficiencies of subcontractors  manufacturing and purchased price variances  warranty and recall costs and timing of sales over the next few quarters can cause our cost of revenues percentage to vary significantly 
in addition  we may experience higher prices on commodity components that are included in our products 
in addition  cost variances associated with the manufacturing ramp of new products  or the write off of initial inventory purchases due to product launch delays or the lack of market acceptance of our new products could occur  which would increase our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 
further  new products typically have lower gross margins for a period of time after their introduction due to higher component costs attributable to the technological complexity of the newer products and lower initial production volumes 
we have launched a number of new products over the last several quarters  and new products are becoming an increasing percentage of our revenues 
we also have a number of initiatives focused on value engineering the design of certain of our hdx products  which began to positively impact our gross margins in the third quarter of in addition to the uncertainties listed above  cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase due to a change in our mix of distribution channels and the mix of international versus north american revenues 
cost of service revenues and service gross margins cost of service revenues consists primarily of material and direct labor  including stock based compensation costs  depreciation  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
generally  services have a lower gross margin than our product gross margins 
cost of service revenues and service gross margins included charges for stock based compensation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
overall  service gross margins increased in over primarily as a result of increased video related maintenance services where we benefited from economies of scale  as well as achieving greater efficiencies in our product installation and implementation services 
overall  service gross margins increased in over as a result of revenues increasing at a faster pace than related service costs  as well as a shift in mix of services revenues toward higher margin video maintenance revenues 
this was offset partially by increased expenses related to stock based compensation 
our service inventory levels at december  have also increased significantly from the december  levels as a result of an increase in the number of products that we service and the level of inventory required to service our growing installed base 
forecasting future service gross margin percentages is difficult  and there are a number of risks related to our ability to maintain or improve our current gross margin levels 
uncertainties surrounding revenue levels  
table of contents including future potential discounts as a result of the economy or in response to the strengthening of the us dollar in our international markets  and related attach rates for new service as well as maintenance renewal rates  the utilization of our professional services personnel as we develop our professional services practice and expand our offerings  our ability to achieve greater efficiencies in the installations of our rpx telepresence product  increasing costs for freight and repair costs  and the timing of sales over the next few quarters can cause our cost of services revenues percentage to vary from quarter to quarter 
sales and marketing expenses year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands expenses of total revenues pts pt sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for our sales force  stock based compensation costs  advertising and promotional expenses  product marketing expenses  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
sales and marketing expenses  except for direct marketing expenses  are not allocated to our segments 
sales and marketing expenses included charges for stock based compensation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue increased by percentage points in as compared to the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars in over was due primarily to an increase in compensation costs as a result of increases in our sales and marketing headcount as well as increases in revenue  and to a lesser extent  increases in marketing programs 
sales and marketing headcount has increased from december  to december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue is due primarily to the significant investments we made in our sales team and the time required for new sales personnel to achieve optimal sales productivity levels 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue increased by percentage point in as compared to the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in over was due primarily to an increase in sales commissions and co op marketing charges as a result of increased revenues  increases in our sales and marketing headcount due to our acquisition of spectralink and the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts  as well as increased compensation charges due to incentive compensation costs and stock based compensation expense 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to remain relatively stable in absolute dollars as a result of previous investments we have made in increasing our sales coverage across all our markets  including emerging markets and key vertical markets 
over time we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue as the sales productivity of new sales personnel increases and revenues increase 
however  forecasting sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue is highly dependent on expected revenue levels and could vary significantly depending on actual revenues achieved 
marketing expenses will also fluctuate depending upon the timing and extent of marketing programs as we market new products and also depending upon the timing of trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses may also fluctuate due to increased international expenses and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
from time to time  in order to control operating expenses in any given quarter  we may take actions to reduce costs such as delay or limit the scope of marketing programs and other projects  impose travel restrictions  request employees to use paid time off or implement other cost control measures 
such actions may not be able to be implemented in a timely fashion or may not be successful in completely offsetting the impact of lower than anticipated revenues

in addition  an increasing percentage of our research and development is being performed in lower cost jurisdictions 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased for as compared to  primarily due to spending increasing by in over as compared to revenues increasing in over the increase in absolute dollars in as compared to was due to planned increases in program development expenses to support increased investment in new product initiatives  such as our high definition video and voice products and enhancements to our infrastructure products  as well as increased compensation charges related to increased headcount due to our acquisition of spectralink  incentive accruals and stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses increased in as compared to in both our video solutions and voice communications solutions segments 
we are currently investing research and development resources to enhance and upgrade the products that comprise our unified collaboration communications solutions  which encompass products and services across our product lines  including enhancements to our existing infrastructure products  products that address the high definition video conferencing market and additional voice over ip and wireless products 
in addition  we are investing research and development resources to support our strategic partnerships 
we also anticipate committing a greater proportion of our research and development expenses toward enhancing the integration and interoperability of our entire video solutions product suite 
we believe that technological leadership is critical to our future success  and we are committed to continuing a significant level of research and development to develop new technologies and products to combat competitive pressures 
also  continued investment in new product initiatives will require significant research and development spending 
we expect that research and development expenses will decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in over to as we continue to manage headcount and related expenses and an increasing percentage of research and development is performed in lower cost jurisdictions 
from time to time  in order to control operating expenses in any given quarter  we may take actions to reduce costs such as delay or limit the scope of engineering projects  impose travel restrictions  request employees to use paid time off or implement other cost control measures

general and administrative expenses included charges for stock based compensation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in  as compared to the decrease in spending in absolute dollars in general and administrative in over was primarily due to decreased stock based compensation charges and legal and outside services  partially offset by increased bad debt expense and compensation charges related to increased headcount  as well as increased facilities and information technology costs 
in  the decrease in stock based compensation accounted for million of the decrease and legal and outside services accounted for million of the decrease 
these decreases were partially offset by increased compensation charges of million  increased bad debt expense of million  and increased infrastructure costs of million 
the remaining changes are related to numerous smaller items 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses remained flat in  as compared to the increase in spending in absolute dollars in general and administrative in over was primarily due to increased compensation charges related to increased headcount from our spectralink acquisition  increased incentive accruals and stock based compensation expense  as well as increased legal and project related outside services costs 
in  the increase in compensation charges  including stock compensation costs  accounted for million of the increase  legal and outside services accounted for million of the increase and increases in infrastructure costs accounted for million of the increase 
the remaining changes are related to numerous smaller items 
future charges related to costs associated with litigation  or uncollectibility of our receivables could increase our general and administrative expenses and negatively affect our profitability in the quarter in which they are recorded 
additionally  predicting the timing of litigation and bad debt expense is difficult 
future general and administrative expense increases or decreases in absolute dollars are difficult to predict due to the lack of visibility of certain costs  including legal costs associated with defending claims against us  or with asserting and enforcing our rights concerning our intellectual property portfolio and other factors 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will likely remain flat in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in from time to time  in order to control operating expenses in any given quarter  we may take actions to reduce costs such as delay or limit the scope of administrative projects  impose travel restrictions  request employees to use paid time off or implement other cost control measures

there were no such charges in or the research and development acquired as part of the spectralink acquisition related primarily to projects associated with enhancements and upgrades to the functionality and performance of the spectralink  spectralink and dect products 
the amount allocated to purchased in process research and development was determined by management after considering  among other factors  established valuation techniques in the high technology communications industry and was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed for these in process research and development projects as of the acquisition date 
all significant in process research and development projects had been completed as of december  amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles in  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  for amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles acquired in our acquisitions 
in addition to the amounts recorded as operating expenses in and  we recorded amortization totaling million and million  respectively  related to certain technology intangibles in cost of product revenues 
purchased intangible assets are being amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives  which range from several months to eight years 
in and  million and million  respectively  of the total operating expense related to the impairment of certain intangibles that we acquired in the voyant acquisition 
there was no impairment in the decrease in absolute dollars in as compared to was primarily due to lower amortization of certain intangibles acquired in the voyant acquisition due to their impairment in the fourth quarter of the increase in absolute dollars in as compared to was primarily due to the purchased intangibles from the spectralink and destiny acquisitions in early  partially offset by decreases related to certain purchased intangibles related to the voyant acquisition becoming fully amortized as of december  we evaluate our purchased intangibles for possible impairment on an ongoing basis 
when impairment indicators exist  we perform an assessment to determine if the intangible asset has been impaired and to what extent 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment is conducted by first estimating the undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the purchased intangibles and comparing this amount with the carrying value of these assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  impairment exists  and future cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate and compared to the carrying amounts of the purchased intangibles to determine the amount of the impairment 
based on the results of the and impairment assessments  we determined that certain purchased intangible assets acquired as part of the voyant acquisition had been impaired as of the respective year end periods  and we recorded impairment charges of approximately million  and million  respectively 
in and  these assets were written down as a result of a decline in the projected future cash flows from future products that will utilize the technology acquired in the acquisition 
at december   the carrying value of our purchased intangibles was million 
restructure costs in  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  related to restructuring actions which resulted from the elimination or relocation of various positions as part of restructuring plans approved by management 
in  these actions were intended to streamline and focus our efforts and more properly align our cost structure with our projected revenue streams 
in  these actions primarily related to the reorganization of our video and infrastructure divisions into one combined business unit  
table of contents the video solutions group  and the elimination of certain executive positions 
in  these actions included the relocation of our asia pacific headquarters from hong kong to singapore  as well as elimination of certain other sales and administrative functions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on restructure costs 
on january   we announced the implementation of a workforce reduction designed to reduce our cost structure while maintaining flexibility to invest in the strategic growth areas of the business 
the plan includes elimination of approximately positions  or six percent of our global workforce  with most of these reductions taking effect immediately 
we currently expect to record restructuring charges and make cash expenditures totaling approximately million in the first quarter of resulting from these actions  primarily related to severance and other employee termination benefits 
in the future  we may take additional restructuring actions to gain operating efficiencies or reduce our operating expenses  while simultaneously implementing additional cost containment measures and expense control programs 
such restructuring actions are subject to significant risks  including delays in implementing expense control programs or workforce reductions and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or a decrease in employee morale  all of which would impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions 
if we do not achieve the anticipated cost reductions  our business could be harmed 
litigation reserves and payments during  we recorded charges totaling million as a result of trial preparation costs and the fee arrangement we had with our outside legal counsel that represented us in our litigation against codian  pursuant to which we owed additional legal fees based upon the favorable outcome that was achieved in the first quarter of there were no such expenses in or see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
we are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future and could result in charges that would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  our results of operations  or our cash flows 
interest income  net interest income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments net of bank charges resulting from the use of our bank accounts 
interest income  net of interest expense  was million in  million in and million in interest income decreased in over primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances due to our stock repurchase activity in and lower average investment returns 
average interest rate returns on our cash and investments were in  compared to in interest income decreased in over primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances as a result of the net cash paid for our acquisitions of spectralink and destiny in the first quarter of  as well as due to our stock repurchase activity in this was partially offset by higher average investment returns 
average interest rate returns on our cash and investments were in  compared to in interest income  net will likely fluctuate in due to movement in our cash balances and changes in market interest rates 
the cash balance could decrease depending upon the cash used in future acquisitions  our stock repurchase activity and other factors 

table of contents other income expense  net other income expense  net was a net expense of million in compared to a net expense of million in and net income of million in during we recognized foreign currency related losses of million  million related to the other than temporary impairment recognized on our investments and million related to taxes and licensing 
the extent of the foreign currency related losses and the other than temporary impairment did not occur in the prior years 
other income expense  net could fluctuate significantly depending upon foreign exchange fluctuations and further impairments to our investments 
due to the recent credit crisis  changes in interest and exchange rates and the underlying cost of hedging has been subject to greater fluctuation 
further  the current economic environment has resulted in an increased amount of unrealized losses for certain of our investments  which could result in additional realized losses in the future if current market conditions deteriorate further or if the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur 
gain loss on strategic investments for strategic reasons  we have made various investments in private companies 
the private company investments are carried at cost and written down to fair market value when indications exist that these investments have other than temporarily declined in value 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist and make appropriate reductions in carrying value  if necessary 
we evaluate a number of factors  including price per share of any recent financing  expected timing of additional financing  liquidation preferences  historical and forecast earnings and cash flows  cash burn rate  and technological feasibility of the investee company s products to assess whether or not the investment is impaired 
at december  and  these investments had a carrying value of million and million  respectively  and are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
in  and  we made additional investments in three private companies totaling million  million and million  respectively 
in  our investments were permanently written down by million from original cost  which is reflected in gain loss on strategic investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
the write down of million in the second quarter of was based upon our evaluation of the investee s financial position  including cash usage  the status of the investee s business prospects as of june   and the rights and privileges associated with the investment 
based on this evaluation and our intent as of june  not to participate in the round of additional funding of the investee that was in process at the time  it was determined that based upon the preferences  including liquidation preferences  that would be held by more senior securities  the write down of the carrying value to zero was necessary 
provision for income taxes our overall effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively  which resulted in a provision for income taxes  of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in versus was primarily related to the release of million in tax reserves and related interest and penalties due to the lapse of the statutes of limitation in various foreign jurisdictions in combined with the non deductibility in of the in process research and development acquired in the spectralink acquisition 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in versus was due to a relative increase in foreign earnings which are subject to lower tax rates  combined with the settlement of certain audits with foreign tax authorities  substantially offset by the non deductibility of the in process research and development acquired in the spectralink acquisition 
as of december   we had approximately million in tax net operating loss carryforwards and million in tax credit carryovers  as well as other deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences 
in 
table of contents addition  at december  we had a valuation allowance of million related to net operating loss carryforwards in certain foreign jurisdictions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on income tax expense must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
as a result  we decreased our reserves for uncertain tax positions by million 
a million decrease in relation to interest and penalties and various tax reserves was accounted for as a cumulative adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
a million decrease related to pre acquisition tax reserves was accounted for as an adjustment to goodwill 
at the adoption date of january   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  million of which would affect our income tax expense if recognized 
the remaining balance of the unrecognized tax benefits of million would be an adjustment to goodwill or stockholders equity 
in addition  we recognized certain net operating loss carryovers of picturetel that had not been recognized previously 
this resulted in the establishment of a deferred tax asset of million and a corresponding reduction in goodwill 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as changes in tax legislation  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof  the geographic composition of our pre tax income  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions  amounts of tax exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre tax income  final resolution of the tax impact from the exercise of incentive stock options and the issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase plan  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
we believe that our future effective tax rate may be more volatile as a result of these factors 
segment information a description of our products and services  as well as annual financial data  for each segment can be found in the business section of this form k and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the results discussions below include the results of each of our segments for the years ended december   and segment contribution margin includes all segment revenues less the related cost of sales  direct marketing and direct engineering expenses 
management allocates corporate manufacturing costs and some infrastructure costs such as facilities and it costs in determining segment contribution margin 
contribution margin is used  in part  to evaluate the performance of  and to allocate resources to  each of the segments 
certain operating expenses are not allocated to segments because they are separately managed at the corporate level 
these unallocated costs include sales costs  marketing costs other than direct marketing  stock based compensation costs  general and administrative costs  such as legal and accounting costs  acquisition related integration costs  amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets  purchase accounting adjustments made to inventory  purchased in process research and development costs  restructuring costs  interest income  net  and other expense  net 
video solutions year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands revenues contribution margin contribution margin as of video solutions revenues pts pt revenues from our video solutions segment increased by million or over to million in revenue from video communications products increased to million for from million 
table of contents in  an increase  primarily due to an increase in sales volumes and average selling prices of our group video products  which consisted primarily of our vsx and hdx product families 
with the increasing adoption of high definition hd throughout  our hdx products comprised an increasing percentage of the group video units sold and contributed to higher average selling prices 
in the fourth quarter of  approximately of our video communications product revenues were derived from our high definition hdx products versus our standard definition vsx products 
revenues also increased as a result of increased revenues from sales of our rpx and tpx telepresence products 
the return on investment of video may be helping drive growth in our video solutions segment  which may make this segment of our business more resilient in the current economic environment 
revenues from our infrastructure products for were million  a decrease of compared to revenues of million  due primarily to decreases in our voice infrastructure product revenues  which was only partially offset by increases in revenues from our video infrastructure products 
revenues from our video solutions segment increased by million or over to million in revenue from video communications products increased to million for from million in  a increase  primarily due to an increase in sales volumes and average selling prices of our group video products  which consisted primarily of our vsx and hdx product families 
revenues from our infrastructure products for were million  essentially flat compared to revenues of million  due primarily to increases in revenues from our video infrastructure and software product sales being substantially offset by decreases in our voice infrastructure revenues 
infrastructure product revenues were impacted by a decrease in video network system average selling prices  due in part to increased competition 
international revenues defined as revenues outside of canada and the us  accounted for  and of our video solutions segment revenues for  and  respectively 
in and  one channel partner accounted for more than of our total net revenues for our video solutions segment 
in  no one channel partner accounted for more than of our total net revenues for our video solutions segment 
we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any one channel partner would have a long term material adverse effect on consolidated revenues as we believe end users would likely purchase our products from a different channel partner 
however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period 
the contribution margin as a percentage of video solutions segment revenues was in as compared to in contribution margins increased primarily as a result of engineering expenses decreasing as a percent of revenues and in absolute dollars  partially offset by slightly lower gross margins and increased direct marketing expenses 
gross margins decreased primarily due to changes in product mix 
video solutions gross margins were negatively impacted by the year over year decrease in revenues from our voice infrastructure products  which typically have higher gross margins than our video communications products 
the lower video solutions gross margins in as compared to was also due to lower video communications product gross margins due in part to new products which typically have lower gross margins for a period of time after their introduction due to higher component costs attributable to the technological complexity of the newer products and lower initial production volumes 
we have recently launched a number of new products  including our hdx and rpx product lines  and newer products are becoming an increasing percentage of our revenues 
we also have a number of initiatives focused on reducing new product costs through value engineering the design of certain of our hdx products  which we began to see positively impact our gross margins in the third quarter of the contribution margin as a percentage of video solutions segment revenues was in as compared to in contribution margins increased primarily as a result of engineering expenses decreasing as a percent of revenues  although increasing in absolute dollars 
this was offset by slightly lower gross margins in as compared to in both our video and infrastructure product lines 
this was due in part to new products which typically have lower gross margins for a period of time after their introduction 
direct marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars and slightly as a percent of revenues 

table of contents direct marketing and engineering spending in the video solutions segment will fluctuate depending upon the timing of new product launches and marketing programs 
voice communications solutions year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands revenues contribution margin contribution margin as of voice communications solutions revenues pts revenues from our voice communications solutions segment for increased over to million  due primarily to increases in sales volumes of our voice over ip and installed voice products  as well as a full year of revenues from our wireless voice products acquired in the spectralink acquisition during the first quarter of revenues from products acquired in the spectralink acquisition accounted for approximately of the increase in revenues in this segment 
this was partially offset by year over year decreases in revenues from our circuit switch products 
in  excluding the impact of the spectralink acquisition on growth rates  we experienced slower growth than in in our voice product lines due in part to the global economic conditions 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  our worldwide voice product revenues declined by from the third quarter of and compared to the fourth quarter of our voice products do not provide the same return on investment profile that we believe our video solutions products provide to customers who are curtailing travel and other related expenditures in a down economy  making our voice products more susceptible to the current economic downturn 
revenues from our voice communications solutions segment for increased over to million  due primarily to revenues from our spectralink wireless voice products acquired during the first quarter of  as well as increased sales volumes of our voice over ip products and circuit switched products 
revenues from products acquired in the spectralink acquisition accounted for million of the increase over excluding spectralink revenues  voice communications solutions segment revenues for increased over international revenues  defined as revenues outside of canada and the us  accounted for  and of our total voice communications solutions segment revenues for  and  respectively 
in  and  no one customer accounted for more than of our total net revenues or of our voice communications solutions segment revenues 
the contribution margin as a percentage of voice communications segment revenues was in and the contribution margin remained flat primarily due to lower gross margins partially offset by engineering expenses decreasing as a percent of revenues although increasing in absolute dollars 
the decrease in gross margins was due to the higher mix of voice over ip handset and wireless product revenues which generally have a lower gross margin than our circuit switched and installed voice products 
engineering expenses increased in absolute dollars primarily as a result of the spectralink acquisition which was completed during the last week of the first quarter of direct marketing spending increased in absolute dollars in  while remaining flat as a percentage of revenues when compared with the contribution margin as a percentage of voice communications solutions segment revenues was in as compared to in the decrease in contribution margin was primarily due to lower gross margins due to the higher mix of voice over ip handset and wireless product revenues which generally have a lower gross margin than our circuit switched and installed voice products and increased engineering expenses which increased as a percent of revenues  as well as in absolute dollars in as compared to due primarily to 
table of contents the spectralink acquisition at the end of the first quarter of our gross margins on our wireless products were also negatively impacted by changes in our distribution model whereby we transitioned certain direct customers and resellers to purchase from our distributors and this may continue 
direct marketing spending increased in absolute dollars in  while decreasing as a percentage of revenues during the year 
direct marketing and engineering spending in the voice communications solutions segment will fluctuate depending upon the timing of new product launches and marketing programs 
services year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands revenues contribution margin contribution margin as of service revenue pts revenues from our services segment increased by in over to million  due primarily to increased video related services and  to a lesser extent  increased video infrastructure product related services 
in addition  a full year of revenues from services related to products acquired in the spectralink acquisition accounted for of the increase over the year ago period 
revenues from our services segment for increased over to million  due primarily to increased revenues from our spectralink acquisition in the first quarter of as well as increases in video solutions related services  including both video endpoints and video infrastructure 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in voice infrastructure maintenance services 
revenues from services related to products acquired in the spectralink acquisition accounted for million of the increase over the year ago period 
international revenues  defined as revenues outside of canada and the us  accounted for  and of total service revenues for  and  respectively 
no one customer accounted for more than of our total revenues for our services segment for  or overall  the services segment contribution margin remained flat as a percentage of service segment revenues in versus gross margins and operating expenses were essentially flat as a percentage of revenues 
gross margins have been impacted by increased service costs  including increased headcount related costs  repair costs and shipping costs 
service gross margins were negatively impacted during by negative gross margins on the installation of our rpx telepresence product 
we expect to improve margins on these product installations as we train additional personnel and achieve greater efficiencies  as well as evaluate our pricing model 
overall  the increase in the services segment contribution margin as a percentage of service segment revenues in versus is due primarily to increased gross margins more than offsetting increases in operating expenses 
service gross margins increased in as compared to as a result of revenue increasing at a faster pace than related service costs 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
cash and cash equivalents includes cash in the bank of approximately million and the remaining million is comprised primarily of highly liquid investments in commercial paper  us government securities  time deposits  savings accounts  money market funds and corporate debt securities with original maturities of days or less at the time of purchase 
substantially all of our short term and long term investments are comprised of us 
table of contents government securities  corporate debt securities and corporate preferred equity securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also have outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million that are in place to satisfy certain of our facility lease requirements 
our total cash and cash equivalents and investments held in the united states totaled million as of december   and the remaining million was held outside of the united states in various foreign subsidiaries 
if we would need to access our cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside of the united states in order to fund acquisitions  share repurchases or our working capital needs  we may be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes 
we generated cash from operating activities totaling million in  million in and million in the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to increased net income and non cash expenses  a decrease in accounts receivable and a larger increase in other accrued liabilities 
offsetting these positive effects were a larger increase in inventories  a large decrease in accounts payable  a larger increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a larger increase in other accrued liabilities 
the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to increased net income and non cash expenses  and larger increases in accounts payable and taxes payable 
offsetting these positive effects were a larger increase in accounts receivable  larger increase in inventories  smaller decrease in deferred taxes  smaller increase in other accrued liabilities and a larger increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended was a decrease of million 
the primary sources of cash were million from operating activities and million associated with the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
the primary uses of cash during this period were million for purchases of our common stock  million for purchases of investments  net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and million for purchases of property and equipment 
the positive cash from operating activities was primarily the result of net income  adjusted for non cash expenses and other items such as depreciation  amortization  the provision for doubtful accounts  inventory write downs for excess and obsolescence  non cash stock based compensation  excess tax benefit from stock based compensation and the tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options  reductions in deferred taxes and net increases in accounts receivables  taxes payable and other accrued liabilities 
offsetting the positive effect of these items were net decreases in accounts payable  and increases in inventories and prepaid expenses and other assets 
our days sales outstanding  or dso  metric was days at december  compared to days at december  we expect that dso will remain in the to day range but could vary as a result of a number of factors such as fluctuations in revenue linearity  an increase in international receivables which typically have longer payment terms and increases in receivables from service providers and government entities that have longer payment terms of and days  respectively  compared to day terms for other customers 
dso could be negatively impacted in the current economic environment if our partners experience difficulty in financing purchases  which results in delays in payment to us 
inventory turns decreased from turns at december  to turns at december  the decrease in inventory turns was a result of significant growth in our finished goods inventory levels during the year primarily as a result of lower revenues than planned  the difference in planned versus actual sales mix of products  as well as weaker revenue linearity  growth in service inventory levels and other factors 
we believe inventory turns will fluctuate depending on our ability to reduce lead times  as well as changes in product mix and a greater mix of ocean freight versus air freight to reduce freight costs 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts  which typically mature in one month  to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  and cash balances 
we record on the balance sheet at each reporting period the fair value of our forward exchange contracts and record any fair value adjustments in results of operations 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on contracts are recorded as other income expense  offsetting transaction gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
additionally  our hedging costs can vary depending upon the size of our 
table of contents hedge program  whether we are purchasing or selling foreign currency relative to the us dollar and interest rate spreads between the us and other foreign markets  which may have been subject to greater fluctuations and less predictability due to the recent credit crisis 
additionally  we also have a hedging program that uses forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated revenues and operating expenses denominated in the euro and british pound as well as operating expenses denominated in israeli shekels 
at each reporting period  we record the fair value of our unrealized forward contracts on the balance sheet with related unrealized gains and losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate element of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses associated with the effective portion of the forward exchange contracts are recorded within revenue or operating expense  depending upon the underlying exposure being hedged 
any ineffective portion of a hedging instrument would be recorded as other income expense 
from time to time  the board of directors has approved plans for us to purchase shares of our common stock at our discretion in the open market 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased approximately million  million and million shares  respectively  of our common stock in the open market for cash of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we were authorized to purchase up to an additional million under the share repurchase plan 
at december   we had open purchase orders related to our contract manufacturers and other contractual obligations of approximately million primarily related to inventory purchases 
we also currently have commitments that consist of obligations under our operating leases 
in the event that we decide to cease using a facility and seek to sublease such facility or terminate a lease obligation through a lease buyout or other means  we may incur a material cash outflow at the time of such transaction  which will negatively impact our operating results and overall cash flows 
in addition  if facilities rental rates decrease or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  we could incur a significant further charge to operations and our operating and overall cash flows could be negatively impacted in the period that these changes or events occur 
these purchase commitments and lease obligations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods  services or leases 
in addition  our bank has issued letters of credit totaling approximately million to secure the leases on some of our offices 
the table set forth below shows  as of december   the future minimum lease payments due under our current lease obligations 
total estimated sublease income in is less than million and is netted in the amounts 
in addition to these minimum lease payments  we are contractually obligated under the majority of our operating leases to pay certain operating expenses during the term of the lease such as maintenance  taxes and insurance 
our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands net minimum lease payments projected annual operating costs other long term liabilities purchase commitments year ending december  thereafter total payments 
table of contents as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted the provisions of fin as of january  at december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the related interest totaling million  which are not included in the above table as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing  debt financing or from other sources 
additional financing may not be available  particularly in the current credit environment or  if available  such financing may not be obtainable on terms favorable to us and could be dilutive 
our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the introduction of new products and potential acquisitions of related businesses or technology 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our process used to develop estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  stock compensation costs  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition and product returns we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  product payment is not contingent upon performance of installation or service obligations  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product or service is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
additionally  we recognize extended service revenue on our hardware and software products ratably over the service period  generally one to five years 
our video solutions products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements related to most of these products through our maintenance contracts 
accordingly  we account for revenue for these products in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date 
if there is an undelivered element under the arrangement  we defer revenue based on 
table of contents vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element  as determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  we defer all revenue until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we accrue for sales returns and other allowances as a reduction to revenues upon shipment based upon our contractual obligations and historical experience 
channel partner programs and incentives we record estimated reductions to revenues for channel partner programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline or competition were to increase further  we may take future actions to increase channel partner incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
co op marketing funds are accounted for in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
under these guidelines  we accrue for co op marketing funds as a marketing expense if we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received  otherwise  it is recorded as a reduction to revenues 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by estimated product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revision of the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly by assessing individual accounts receivable over a specific aging and amount  and all other balances on a pooled basis based on historical collection experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable 
excess and obsolete inventory we record write downs for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration of or increase in that newly established cost basis 
stock based compensation expense we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values in accordance with sfas r  which requires us to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
our determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these underlying factors and assumptions may result in significant variability in the stock based compensation costs we record  which makes 
table of contents such amounts difficult to accurately predict 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statements of operations 
deferred and refundable taxes we estimate our actual current tax expense together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we have million in net deferred tax assets 
included in the net deferred tax asset balance is a million valuation allowance recorded in related to net operating losses generated in certain foreign jurisdictions 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
this interpretation requires us to recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be more likely than not of being sustained 
upon adoption  we decreased our reserves for uncertain tax positions by million 
a million decrease in relation to interest and penalties and various tax reserves was accounted for as a cumulative adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
a million decrease related to pre acquisition tax reserves was accounted for as an adjustment to goodwill 
in addition  we recognized certain net operating loss carryovers of picturetel that had not been recognized previously 
this resulted in the establishment of a deferred tax asset of million and a corresponding reduction in goodwill 
we continue to follow the practice of recognizing interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a part of provision for income taxes 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase combinations the purchase combinations completed require us to identify and estimate the fair value of the assets acquired  including intangible assets other than goodwill  and liabilities assumed in the combinations 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plan for the entities acquired including planned redundancies  restructuring  use of assets acquired and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of obligations assumed for which no future benefit will be received 
for example  in the spectralink acquisition  we identified vacated or redundant facilities that we intend to sublease or for which we intend to negotiate a lease termination settlement 
should actual use of assets or resolution of obligations differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated fair value would be required 
changes occurring in our estimates after the allocation period  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises  would be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
if actual costs are less than our estimates  these charges would continue to be recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
goodwill and purchased intangibles we assess the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles at least annually unless impairment indicators exist sooner 
we assess the impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 

table of contents if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would typically measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test 
the assessment of goodwill impairment was conducted by determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units  as defined in sfas  to the reporting unit s carrying value as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our goodwill assets were not impaired as of december  we assess our purchased intangibles for impairment on an ongoing basis 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment is conducted by first estimating the undiscounted expected future cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the purchased intangibles and comparing this amount with the carrying value of these assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  impairment exists  and future cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate and compared to the carrying amounts of the purchased intangibles to determine the amount of the impairment 
based on events in the fourth quarters of and  we performed an assessment of our purchased intangibles and we determined that certain purchased intangible assets acquired as part of the voyant acquisition had been impaired as of december  and and we recorded impairment charges of approximately million and million  respectively 
there were no impairment charges recorded in as no impairment indicators existed 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill and purchased intangible impairment tests 
non marketable securities we periodically make strategic investments in companies whose stock is not currently traded on any stock exchange and for which no quoted price exists 
the cost method of accounting is used to account for these investments as we hold a non material ownership percentage 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate to us that an impairment exists may be a significant decrease in the market value of the company  poor or deteriorating market conditions in the public and private equity capital markets  significant adverse changes in legal factors or within the business climate the company operates  and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or projections and forecasts that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the company s future business plans 
impairment indicators identified during the reporting period could result in a significant write down in the carrying value of the investment if we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
for example  to date  due to these and other factors  we have recorded cumulative charges against earnings totaling million associated with the impairment of these investments  including million in the second quarter of at december  and december   our strategic investments had a carrying value of million and million  respectively 
derivative instruments the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for derivative instruments designated as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged 
for a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
for derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we generally invest excess cash in marketable debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate debt securities  and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we also invest in corporate preferred equity securities as part of a dividend capture program 
these investments in the dividend capture program are typically hedged for interest rate fluctuations  which may not be effective  however they are generally not significant 
the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates the principal amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets based on the short maturities of these financial instruments 
short term and long term investments consist of us government obligations and foreign and domestic public corporate debt securities and corporate preferred equity securities 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  particularly in light of the recent credit market instability 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may realize losses on the sale of our investments or we may incur further temporary impairment charges requiring us to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we could also incur additional other than temporary impairment charges resulting in realized losses in our statement of operations which would reduce net income 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the security or issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow any anticipated recovery in the market value 
further  if we sell our investments prior to their maturity  we may incur a charge to operations in the period the sale takes place 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of various magnitudes 
in prior years the analysis had been performed for the time periods of months and months 
in the current year we have modified the analysis to model the effect of an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve 
this methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment 
the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our securities  excluding cash and cash equivalents  held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps bps bps bps fair value bps bps bps foreign currency exchange rate risk while the majority of our sales are denominated in united states dollars  we also sell our products and services in certain european regions in euros and in british pounds  which has increased our foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk 
while we do not hedge for speculative purposes  as a result of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we purchase forward exchange contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure to the euro  british pound and israeli shekel 
we mitigate bank counterparty risk related to our foreign currency hedging program through our policy that requires the company to purchase hedge contracts from banks that are among the world s largest banks  as ranked by total assets in us dollars 

table of contents as of december   we had outstanding forward exchange contracts to sell million euros at  sell million british pounds at  and buy million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts hedge our net position of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances and typically mature in days or less 
at december   we also had outstanding forward exchange contracts to sell million euros at  sell million british pounds at  and buy million israeli shekels at that had maturities of more than days 
we also have a cash flow hedging program under which we hedge a portion of anticipated revenues and operating expenses denominated in the euro  british pound and israeli shekels 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to sell million euros at and million british pounds at and to buy million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts  carried at fair value  typically have maturities of less than days 
at december   we also had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to sell million euros at and million british pounds at and buy million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts  carried at fair value  typically have maturities of more than days 
based on our overall currency rate exposure as of december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the united states dollar  relative to our foreign local currencies  would have a positive or negative impact of approximately million on our results of operations 
we may also decide to expand the type of products we sell in foreign currencies or may  for specific customer situations  choose to sell in foreign currencies in our other regions  thereby further increasing our foreign exchange risk
