item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in mexico  we commenced operations during the second quarter of after petr leos mexicanos  the mexican national oil company pemex  awarded our mexican subsidiary  key energy services de m xico s 
de rl de rl  a month contract the first pemex contract valued at approximately million to provide field production solutions and well workover services 
during the fourth quarter of  we were awarded a second month contract with pemex the second pemex contract to provide the same type of well services valued at approximately million 
also  during the fourth quarter of  our first pemex contract was extended until september and the value increased approximately million  for an aggregate value of approximately million 
under the terms of the first pemex contract  we 
table of contents initially provided three well service rigs outfitted with our proprietary keyview system  and we installed two keyview systems on pemex owned well service rigs 
pemex has the option to call for additional rigs and keyview systems in the future  and  as of december   we had supplied pemex a total of rigs 
as of february   we have increased the number of rigs in mexico to rigs 
the projects under both contracts cover pemex s north region assets and initially focus on oil wells in burgos  poza rica altamira and cerro azul 
we anticipate that we will install units with keyview systems on all pemex owned workover rigs over the next two years  through on october   we acquired a interest in ooo geostream services group geostream for million 
geostream is based in the russian federation and provides drilling and workover services and sub surface engineering and modeling in the russian federation 
we are contractually required to purchase an additional of geostream no later than march  for approximately million which at february  is equivalent to million 
for a period not to exceed six years subsequent to october   we will have the option to increase our ownership percentage to 
if we have not acquired of geostream on or before the end of the six year period  we will be required to arrange an initial public offering for those shares 
in  we acquired advanced measurements  inc ami  a privately held canadian technology company focused on oilfield service equipment controls  data acquisition and digital information work flow 
ami builds key s proprietary keyview systems for deployment on our well service rigs  designs and builds control and data acquisition systems for fracturing services and develops additional technologies for key as well as other service providers 
in addition  in connection with the acquisition of ami  we acquired an ownership interest in advanced flow technologies  inc afti  a privately held canadian technology company focused on low cost wireless gas well production monitoring 
as of december   we held a interest in afti 
customers our customers include major oil companies  independent oil and natural gas production companies  and foreign national oil and natural gas production companies 
during the years ended december   and  no single customer accounted for or more of our consolidated revenues 
competition and other external factors in the well servicing markets  we believe that  based on available industry data  we are the largest provider of land based well service rigs in the united states 
at december   we had active rigs 
based on the weatherford aesc aesc well service rig count  which is available on weatherford international s internet website  there were approximately  well service rigs in the united states at december  a prior survey suggested that there are more well service rigs in the united states than are reported by the aesc count 
while we agree that there are likely more rigs than reported by the aesc  aesc provides the most readily available information concerning the us well service rig count 
we believe that the difference between the aesc data and the prior survey is likely attributable to i not all us well service providers being members of the aesc  ii some us oil and natural gas producers owning well service rigs and not reporting to the aesc and iii poor reporting of equipment by certain members of the aesc 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive 
competition is influenced by such factors as price  capacity  availability of work crews  and reputation and experience of the service provider 
we believe that an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long term customer relationships is having an experienced  skilled and well trained work force 
in recent years  many of our larger customers have placed increased emphasis on the safety performance and quality of the crews  equipment and services provided by their contractors 
we have devoted  and will continue to devote  substantial resources toward employee safety 
table of contents and training programs 
in addition  we believe that the keyview system has provided and will continue to provide important safety enhancements 
although we believe customers consider all of these factors  price is often the primary factor in determining which service provider is awarded the work 
however  in numerous instances we secure and maintain work for large customers for which efficiency  safety  technology  size of fleet and availability of other services are of equal importance to price 
due  in part  to dramatic declines in the price of oil and natural gas  pricing for our services has become increasingly competitive since september of further  as demand drops for oilfield services  the market is left with excess supply  placing additional pressure on our pricing 
significant well service providers include nabors industries  basic energy services and complete production services 
other public company competitors include bronco drilling  forbes energy services and pioneer drilling company 
in addition  though there has been consolidation in the domestic well servicing industry  there are numerous small companies that compete in key s well servicing markets 
we do not believe that any other competitor has more active well service rigs than key 
in argentina  our largest competitors are san antonio international formerly pride international  nabors industries and allis chalmers energy 
san antonio international and forbes energy services are our largest competitors in mexico 
the pressure pumping services market is dominated by three major competitors schlumberger ltd  halliburton company and bj services company 
these three companies have a substantially larger asset base than key and are believed to operate in all major us oil and natural gas producing basins 
other competitors include weatherford international ltd  superior well services  inc  basic energy services  inc  complete production services  inc  frac tech services  ltd 
and rpc  inc the pressure pumping industry is very competitive  and the three major competitors generally lead pricing in any particular region 
our pressure pumping services operate in niche markets and historically have competed effectively with these competitors based on performance and strong customer service 
where feasible  we cross market our electric wireline services to a number of customers where our pressure pumping crews work in tandem with our wireline crews  thereby offering our customers the ability to minimize vendors  which  we believe  will improve efficiency 
we may be able to further pursue other cross marketing opportunities utilizing capabilities that are unique to key  because none of the three major pressure pumping contractors own and operate well service rigs in the united states 
the us fishing and rental services market is fragmented compared to our other product lines 
companies that provide fishing services generally compete based on the reputation of their fishing tool operators and their relationships with customers 
competition for rental tools is sometimes based on price  however  in most cases  when a customer chooses a specific fishing tool operator for a particular job  then the necessary rental equipment will be part of that job as well 
our primary competitors include baker oil tools  smith international  inc  weatherford international ltd  basic energy services  inc  superior energy services inc  quail tools owned by parker drilling company and knight oil tools 
the need for well servicing  pressure pumping services and fishing and rental services fluctuates  primarily  in relation to the price or anticipated price of oil and natural gas  which  in turn  is driven by the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas 
generally  as supply of those commodities decreases and demand increases  service and maintenance requirements increase as oil and natural gas producers attempt to maximize the productivity of their wells in a higher priced environment 
however  in a lower oil and natural gas price environment  such as the one we are currently experiencing  demand for service and maintenance decreases as oil and natural gas producers decrease their activity 
in particular  the demand for new or existing field drilling and completion work  including electric wireline services  is driven by available investment capital for such work 
because these types of services can be easily started and stopped  and oil and natural gas producers are less risk tolerant when commodity prices are low or volatile  we may experience a more rapid decline in demand for these types of well maintenance services compared with demand for other types of oilfield services 
further  in this lower priced environment  fewer well service rigs are needed for completions and there is reduced demand for fishing services because these activities are generally associated with drilling activity 

table of contents the level of our revenues  earnings and cash flows are substantially dependent upon  and affected by  the level of domestic and international oil and natural gas exploration and development activity  as well as the equipment capacity in any particular region 
for a more detailed discussion  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  persons in our domestic operations and approximately  additional persons in argentina  mexico and canada 
not including the reductions in force that were initiated by the company in response to market conditions  we experienced an annual domestic employee turnover rate of approximately during  compared to a turnover rate of approximately in the high turnover rate is caused  in part  by the nature of the work  which is physically demanding and sometimes performed in harsh outdoor conditions 
as a result  workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with ours 
alternatively  some employees may leave key if they can earn a higher wage with a competitor 
our domestic employees are not represented by a labor union and are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
many of our employees in argentina are represented by formal unions 
beginning in  we have been experiencing significant labor related issues in argentina as a result of not being able to terminate the employment of field and office personnel because of restrictions imposed by local regulatory agencies in that country 
in mexico  during  we entered into a collective bargaining agreement that applies to our workers in mexico performing work under the pemex contracts 
other than with respect to the labor situation in argentina  we have not experienced any significant work stoppages associated with labor disputes or grievances and consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 
a discussion of the risks associated with our high turnover is presented under business related risk factors in item a 
risk factors 
governmental regulations our operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations pertaining to health  safety and the environment 
we cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws or regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings in the future 
we also cannot predict whether additional laws and regulations affecting our business will be adopted  or the effect such changes might have on us  our financial condition or our business 
the following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental  health and safety laws and regulations to which our operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our results of operation or financial position 
environmental regulations our operations routinely involve the storage  handling  transport and disposal of bulk waste materials  some of which contain oil  contaminants and regulated substances 
various environmental laws and regulations require prevention  and where necessary  cleanup of spills and leaks of such materials  and some of our operations must obtain permits that limit the discharge of materials 
failure to comply with such environmental requirements or permits may result in fines and penalties  remediation orders and revocation of permits 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent over the years  and in certain circumstances may impose strict liability  rendering us liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on our part 
moreover  cleanup costs  penalties and other damages arising as a result of new or changes to existing environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
from time to time  claims have been made and litigation has been brought against us under such laws 
however  the costs incurred in connection with such claims and other costs of environmental compliance have not had a material adverse effect on our past operations or financial statements 
management believes that key conducts its 
table of contents operations in substantial compliance with current federal  state and local requirements related to health  safety and the environment 
hazardous substances and waste the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended  referred to as cercla or the superfund law  and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain defined persons  including current and prior owners or operators of a site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
under cercla  these responsible persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies 
in the course of our operations  we do not typically generate materials that are considered hazardous substances 
one exception  however  would be spills that occur prior to well treatment materials being circulated downhole 
for example  if we spill acid on a roadway as a result of a vehicle accident in the course of providing well stimulation services  or if a tank with acid leaks prior to downhole circulation  the spilled material may be considered a hazardous substance 
in this respect  we are occasionally considered to generate materials that are regulated as hazardous substances and  as a result  may incur cercla liability for cleanup costs 
also  claims may be filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants 
we also generate solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended  or rcra  and comparable state statutes 
certain materials generated in the exploration  development or production of crude oil and natural gas are excluded from rcra s hazardous waste regulation  but these wastes  which include wastes currently generated during our operations  could be designated as hazardous wastes in the future and become subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements 
any such changes in these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating expense 
although we used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been released at properties owned or leased by us now or in the past  or at other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes were taken for treatment or disposal 
under cercla  rcra and analogous state laws  we could be required to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater  or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination 
air emissions the clean air act  as amended  or caa  and similar state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements 
these laws and regulations may require us to obtain approvals or permits for construction  modification or operation of certain projects or facilities and may require use of emission controls 
our failure to comply with caa requirements and those of similar state laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties  injunctions and restrictions on operations 
global warming and climate control scientific studies suggest that emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane may contribute to warming of the earth s atmosphere 
in response to such studies  the us congress is considering legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
in addition  many states have already taken measures to address greenhouse gases through the development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
as a result of the us supreme court s decision on april  in massachusetts et al 
v 
epa  the environmental protection agency the epa may regulate greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources eg cars and trucks even if congress does not adopt new legislation 
the court s holding in massachusetts that greenhouse gases are covered pollutants under the caa may also result in future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources 
in addition  some states where we 
table of contents have operations have become more active in the regulation of emissions that are believed to be contributing to global climate change 
for example  california enacted the global warming solutions act of  which established the first statewide program in the united states to limit greenhouse gas emissions and impose penalties for non compliance 
while we do not believe our operations raise climate control issues different from those generally raised by commercial use of fossil fuels  legislation or regulatory programs that restrict greenhouse gas emissions in areas where we conduct business could increase our costs in order to stay compliant with any new laws 
water discharges we operate facilities that are subject to requirements of the clean water act  as amended  or cwa  and analogous state laws that impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters 
pursuant to these laws  permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state waters or waters of the united states  including to discharge storm water runoff from certain types of facilities 
spill prevention  control and countermeasure requirements under the cwa require implementation of measures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill 
other requirements for the prevention of spills are established under the oil pollution act of  as amended  or opa  which amends the cwa and applies to owners and operators of vessels  including barges  offshore platforms and certain onshore facilities 
under opa  regulated parties are strictly liable for oil spills and must establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such parties could be statutorily responsible 
the cwa can impose substantial civil and criminal penalties for non compliance 
employees occupational safety and health act we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act  as amended  or osha  and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety 
osha s hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with osha requirements 
marine employees certain of our employees who perform services on our barge rigs or work offshore are covered by the provisions of the jones act  the death on the high seas act and general maritime law 
these laws operate to make the liability limits established under state workers compensation laws inapplicable to these employees 
instead  these employees or their representatives are permitted to pursue actions against us for damages resulting from job related injuries  with generally no limitations on our potential liability 
other laws and regulations saltwater disposal wells we operate swd wells that are subject to the cwa  safe drinking water act  and state and local laws and regulations  including those established by the epa s underground injection control program which establishes the minimum program requirements 
most of our swd wells are located in texas and we also operate swd wells in arkansas  louisiana and new mexico 
regulations in these states require us to obtain a permit to operate each of our swd wells 
the applicable regulatory agency may suspend or modify one of our permits if our well operation is likely to result in pollution of freshwater  substantial violation of permit conditions or applicable rules  or leaks to the environment 
we maintain insurance against some risks associated with our well service activities  but there can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us 
the occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 

table of contents electric wireline we conduct cased hole electric wireline logging  which may entail the use of radioactive isotopes along with other nuclear  electrical  acoustic and mechanical devices to evaluate downhole formation 
our activities involving the use of isotopes are regulated by the us nuclear regulatory commission and specified agencies of certain states 
additionally  we may use high explosive charges for perforating casing and formations  and various explosive cutters to assist in wellbore cleanout 
such operations are regulated by the us department of justice  bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms  and explosives and require us to obtain licenses or other approvals for the use of densitometers as well as explosive charges 
we have obtained these licenses and approvals when necessary and believe that we are in substantial compliance with these federal requirements 
item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered in evaluating us and our business 
business related risk factors our business is dependent on conditions in the oil and natural gas industry  especially oil and natural gas prices and capital expenditures by oil and natural gas companies  and the recent volatility in oil and natural gas prices  in addition to the deteriorating credit markets and disruptions in the us and global financial systems  may adversely impact our business 
prices for oil and natural gas historically have been extremely volatile and have reacted to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas 
these include changes resulting from  among other things  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to support oil prices  domestic and worldwide economic conditions and political instability in oil producing countries 
weakness in oil and natural gas prices or the perception by our customers that oil and natural gas prices will continue to decrease could result in further reduction in the utilization of available well service equipment and result in lower rates 
in addition  when oil and natural gas prices are weak  or when our customers expect oil and natural gas prices to decrease  fewer wells are drilled  resulting in less completion and maintenance work for us 
additional factors that affect demand for our services include the level of development  exploration and production activity of  and corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies  oil and natural gas production costs  government regulation  and conditions in the worldwide oil and natural gas industry 
financial markets are in an unprecedented economic crisis worldwide  affecting both debt and equity markets 
the shortage of liquidity and credit combined with the recent substantial losses in worldwide equity markets have led to an economic recession that could continue for an extended period of time 
the slowdown in economic activity caused by the recession has reduced worldwide demand for energy and resulted in lower oil and natural gas prices 
this reduction in demand could continue through and beyond 
demand for our services is primarily influenced by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices 
as a result of recent volatility and significant decreases in oil and natural gas prices and the substantial uncertainty due to the deteriorating credit markets and disruptions in the us and global financial systems  our customers have reduced  and may continue to reduce  their spending on exploration and development drilling 
if economic conditions continue to deteriorate or do not improve  it could result in additional reductions of exploration and production expenditures by our customers  causing further declines in the demand for our services and products 
the decline in demand for our oil and natural gas services could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
further  it is uncertain whether customers  vendors and suppliers will be able to access financing necessary to sustain their previous level of operations  fulfill their commitments and fund future operations and obligations 

table of contents periods of diminished or weakened demand for our services have occurred in the past 
we experienced a material decrease in the demand for our services beginning in august and continuing through september although we experienced strong demand for our services following that period through the third quarter of  we believe the overall decrease in demand resulting from the current economic crisis could be more severe than what we experienced during the downturn 
the current economic downturn and oil and natural gas price volatility could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in light of these and other factors relating to the oil and natural gas industry  our historical operating results may not be indicative of future performance 
we may be unable to maintain pricing on our core services 
during the past three years  we have periodically increased the prices on our services to offset rising costs and to generate higher returns for our shareholders 
however  as a result of pressures stemming from deteriorating market conditions and falling commodity prices  it has become increasingly difficult to maintain our prices 
we have and will likely continue to face pricing pressure from our competitors 
we have made price concessions  and may be compelled to make further price concessions  in order to maintain market share 
the inability to maintain our pricing or reduction in our pricing may have a material negative impact on our operating results 
industry capacity may adversely affect our business 
over much of the past three years  new capacity  including new well service rigs  new pressure pumping equipment and new fishing and rental equipment  has entered the market 
in some cases  the new capacity is attributable to start up oilfield service companies and  in other cases  the new capacity has been deployed by existing service providers to increase their service capacity 
the new capacity adversely affected our utilization rates in  which is down from prior years 
lower utilization of our fleet has led to reduced pricing for our services 
the combination of overcapacity and declining demand has further exacerbated the pricing pressure for our services 
although oilfield service companies are not likely to add significant new capacity under current market conditions  in light of current market conditions and the deteriorating demand for our services  the overcapacity could cause us to experience continued pressure on the pricing of our services and experience lower utilization 
this could have a material negative impact on our operating results 
our business involves certain operating risks  which are primarily self insured  and our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities we might incur in our operations 
our operations are subject to many hazards and risks  including the following blow outs  the uncontrolled flow of natural gas  oil or other well fluids into the atmosphere or an underground formation  reservoir damage  fires and explosions  accidents resulting in serious bodily injury and the loss of life or property  pollution and other damage to the environment  and liabilities from accidents or damage by our fleet of trucks  rigs and other equipment 
if these hazards occur  they could result in suspension of operations  damage to or destruction of our equipment and the property of others  or injury or death to our or a third party s personnel 
we self insure a significant portion of these liabilities 
for losses in excess of our self insurance limits  we maintain insurance from unaffiliated commercial carriers 
however  our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we might incur in our operations 
furthermore  our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability from all of the hazards of our business 
we also are subject to the risk that we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at a reasonable 
table of contents cost 
if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were uninsured or for which we were not fully insured  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to the economic  political and social instability risks of doing business in certain foreign countries 
we currently have operations in argentina  mexico and canada  as well as investments in a drilling and production services company based in canada and a drilling and workover services and sub surface engineering and modeling company based in the russian federation 
we may expand our operations into other foreign countries as well 
as a result  we are exposed to risks of international operations  including increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy in the markets where we operate  inflation and adverse economic conditions stemming from governmental attempts to reduce inflation  such as imposition of higher interest rates and wage and price controls  increased trade barriers  such as higher tariffs and taxes on imports of commodity products  exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  exchange controls or other currency restrictions  war  civil unrest or significant political instability  restrictions on repatriation of income or capital  expropriation  confiscatory taxation  nationalization or other government actions with respect to our assets located in the markets where we operate  governmental policies limiting investments by and returns to foreign investors  labor unrest and strikes  including the significant labor related issues we are currently experiencing in argentina  deprivation of contract rights  and restrictive governmental regulation and bureaucratic delays 
the occurrence of one or more of these risks may negatively impact our results of operations  restrict the movement of funds and equipment to and from affected countries  and inhibit our ability to collect receivables 
we historically have experienced a high employee turnover rate 
any difficulty we experience replacing or adding workers could adversely affect our business 
we historically have experienced an annual employee turnover rate of almost  although we experienced a lower turnover rate domestically during we believe that the high turnover rate is attributable to the nature of the work  which is physically demanding and performed outdoors 
as a result  workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with ours 
we cannot assure that at times of high demand we will be able to retain  recruit and train an adequate number of workers 
potential inability or lack of desire by workers to commute to our facilities and job sites and competition for workers from competitors or other industries are factors that could affect our ability to attract and retain workers 
we believe that our wage rates are competitive with the wage rates of our competitors and other potential employers 
a significant increase in the wages other employers pay could result in a reduction in our workforce  increases in our wage rates  or both 
either of these events could diminish our profitability and growth potential 

table of contents we may not be successful in implementing technology development and technology enhancements 
a component of our business strategy is to incorporate our technology into our well service rigs  primarily through the keyview system 
the inability to successfully develop and integrate the technology could limit our ability to improve our market position  increase our operating costs  and limit our ability to recoup the investments made in technology initiatives 
we may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental  health and safety laws and regulations that govern our operations 
our operations are subject to us federal  state and local  and foreign laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling  storage and disposal of waste materials  including toxic and hazardous wastes 
to comply with these laws and regulations  we must obtain and maintain numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various governmental authorities 
while the cost of such compliance has not been significant in the past  new laws  regulations or enforcement policies could become more stringent and significantly increase our compliance costs or limit our future business opportunities  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
failure to comply with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative  civil or criminal penalties  imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens  revocation of permits  and  to a lesser extent  orders to limit or cease certain operations 
certain environmental laws impose strict and or joint and several liability  which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time of those actions 
for additional information  see the discussion under governmental regulations in item business 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain materials used in providing our pressure pumping services 
we rely heavily on three suppliers for sized sand  a principal raw material that is critical for our pressure pumping operations 
while the materials are generally available  if we were to have a problem sourcing raw materials or transporting these materials from these suppliers  our ability to provide pressure pumping services could be limited 
we may not be successful in identifying  making and integrating our acquisitions 
a component of our growth strategy is to make geographic focused acquisitions that will strengthen our presence in selected regional markets 
pursuit of this strategy may be restricted by the recent deterioration of the credit markets  which may significantly limit the availability of funds for such acquisitions 
in addition to restricted funding availability  the success of this strategy will depend on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates and to negotiate acceptable financial and other terms 
there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
the success of an acquisition depends on our ability to perform adequate diligence before the acquisition and on our ability to integrate the acquisition after it is completed 
while we commit significant resources to ensure that we conduct comprehensive due diligence  there can be no assurance that all potential risks and liabilities will be identified in connection with an acquisition 
similarly  while we expect to commit substantial resources  including management time and effort  to integrating acquired businesses into ours  there is no assurance that we will be successful integrating these businesses 
in particular  it is important that we be able to retain both key personnel of the acquired business and its customer base 
a loss of either key personnel or customers could negatively impact the future operating results of the acquired business 

table of contents debt related risk factors we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness  and to fund planned capital expenditures  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to conditions in the oil and gas industry  general economic and financial conditions  competition in the markets where we operate  the impact of legislative and regulatory actions on how we conduct our business and other factors  all of which are beyond our control 
this risk is significantly exacerbated by the current economic downturn and related instability in the global and us credit markets 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness  or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other capital needs 
if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling assets  reducing or delaying acquisitions or capital investments  such as remanufacturing our rigs and related equipment  or seeking to raise additional capital 
however  we cannot assure you that we would be able to implement alternative financing plans  if necessary  on commercially reasonable terms or at all  or that implementing any such alternative financing plans would allow us to meet our debt obligations 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to obtain alternative financings  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects for growth 
in addition  a downgrade in our credit rating could become more likely if current market conditions continue to worsen 
although such a credit downgrade would not have an effect on our currently outstanding senior debt under our indenture or senior secured credit facility  such a downgrade would make it more difficult for us to raise additional debt financing in the future 
the amount of our debt and the covenants in the agreements governing our debt could negatively impact our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
our level of indebtedness  and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt  could have important consequences for our operations  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and increasing the risk that we may default on our debt obligations  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital  capital expenditures and other general business activities  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate and other activities  limiting management s flexibility in operating our business  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  diminishing our ability to withstand successfully a downturn in our business or the economy generally  placing us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors  and 
table of contents making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates  because certain debt will vary with prevailing interest rates 
we may be required to repay all or a portion of our debt on an accelerated basis in certain circumstances 
if we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt  it could lead to an event of default and the consequent acceleration of our obligation to repay outstanding debt 
our ability to comply with debt covenants and other restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic and financial conditions 
in particular  under the terms of our indebtedness  we must comply with certain financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  several of which become more restrictive over time and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or take some other action in order to comply with them 
our ability to satisfy required financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions  and we cannot assure you that we will continue to meet those ratios and tests in the future 
a breach of any of these covenants  ratios or tests could result in a default under our indebtedness 
if we default  our credit facility lenders will no longer be obligated to extend credit to us and they  as well as the trustee for our outstanding notes  could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the indenture or senior secured credit facility  as applicable  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
the results of such actions would have a significant negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 
borrowings under our senior secured credit facility bear interest at variable rates  exposing us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease 
delayed financial reporting related risk factors taxing authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes from previous years 
we restated our financial statements for periods prior to and experienced delays in our financial reporting for subsequent periods 
as result  we have amended previously filed tax returns and reports through we also intend to amend our and federal and state income tax filings during where legal  regulatory or administrative rules require or allow us to amend our previous tax filings  we intend to comply with our obligations under applicable law 
to the extent that tax authorities do not accept our conclusions about the tax effects of the restatement  liabilities for taxes could differ from those which have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
if it is determined that we have additional tax liabilities  there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
during the past three years  we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
these material weaknesses  if not corrected  could affect the reliability of our financial statements and have other adverse consequences 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related sec rules require management of public companies to assess the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting annually and to include in annual reports on form k a management report on that assessment  together with an attestation report by an independent registered public accounting firm 
under section and the sec rules  a company cannot find that its internal control over financial reporting is effective if there exist any material weaknesses in its financial controls 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 

table of contents we have identified one material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of december  we have taken actions to remediate the material weakness and improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  however  we cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not exist during any failure in the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting  if it results in misstatements in our financial statements  could have a material effect on financial reporting or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations  and could negatively impact investor perceptions 
takeover protection related risks our bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or delay a change in control 
our amended and restated bylaws contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of the board of directors to respond to unsolicited attempts to acquire control of the company 
these provisions establish a classified board of directors  providing for three year staggered terms of office for all members of our board of directors  set limitations on the removal of directors  provide our board of directors the ability to set the number of directors and to fill vacancies on the board of directors occurring between shareholder meetings  and set limitations on who may call a special meeting of shareholders 
these provisions may have the effect of entrenching management and may deprive investors of the opportunity to sell their shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices 
this potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock
