industry summary the global wireless industry has grown significantly since its inception as wireless services have become increasingly available and affordable 
according to ctia the wireless association  the us wireless industry has grown from an estimated total subscriber base of million in to million by mid year  a increase 
ctia also reported that twelve month total wireless service revenues grew from billion to billion in the years ending june  a increase 
additionally  reported annualized wireless minutes has grown at a nearly compound annual growth rate since mid to over trillion in june this expanding subscriber base and corresponding growth in industry revenues has been driven by improved service quality  greater national and international wireless roaming coverage  decreased pricing and the introduction of new messaging  wireless data and content services 
on a global basis  similar trends have been cited by informa  an industry research firm 
according to an informa forecast total worldwide subscribers will rise by from to nearly billion  while global roaming subscribers is expected to rise by to million over the same period 
global roaming revenues are expected to increase by from to nearly billion  with a rising share of total revenues from roaming 

table of contents data s share of mobile roaming revenues is expected to rise steadily from to reach 
wireless industry growth has been accompanied by a steady introduction of new and often incompatible wireless technologies 
this has resulted in the proliferation of different network architectures  including various mobile switch types such as those manufactured by alcatel lucent  nortel  ericsson and motorola  diverse signaling standards such as code division multiple access  or cdma  time division multiple access  or tdma  global system for mobile communication  or gsm  integrated digital enhanced network  or iden  long term evolution  or lte  wimax and wi fi  distinct billing record formats such as cellular intercarrier billing exchange record  or ciber  transferred account procedure  or tap  and remote authentication dial in user service  or radius and multiple network protocols such as frame relay  ss and internet protocol 
this has created significant technological incompatibilities and operational challenges for wireless operators 
as a result  many wireless operators utilize third party technology services providers like us to serve as a trusted intermediary for proprietary data exchange between competitive wireless operators  provide centralized  single point connectivity to the systems and networks of multiple operators  enable communication between new and legacy operator systems by resolving incompatibilities associated with geographic and operator variations in communication protocols  simplify the operational challenges associated with operator differences in the timing of new technology deployment  offer access to a range of intelligent network database services required for enhanced wireless services  and rapidly develop new solutions to meet emerging wireless industry technology complexities and to support next generation services such as wireless data  mim and voip 
market opportunity we expect the technology complexities and operational challenges faced by wireless operators to continue to grow as the wireless industry evolves 
these complexities and challenges are driven by a variety of wireless industry trends including the growth in the number of wireless telephone subscribers  the volume of wireless roaming telephone calls and the growing volume of sms and mms messages and wireless data events 
in addition  the emergence of next generation wireless communication services such as wimax  lte and voip  future government mandated changes  and new applications for existing communications services will drive future industry growth 
technology interoperability services the proliferation and evolution of incompatible wireless communication protocols  messaging data formats and billing standards has made it increasingly difficult for operators to connect systems and networks and to share the information required to offer seamless global wireless voice and data services to subscribers 
technology service providers solve these interoperability problems by offering wireless roaming clearinghouse services  sms and mms messaging translation and routing services  and wireless data roaming facilitation and clearinghouse solutions to support emerging mobile data services 
clearinghouses translate various network signaling and billing protocols to allow different wireless operators to offer and be compensated for roaming services 
these wireless clearinghouses serve as trusted third parties for the collection  translation and distribution of the information required to monitor and invoice services provided by one operator to numerous other operators customers 
demand for clearinghouse services is primarily driven by the number of domestic and international wireless roaming subscribers 
we expect that increased roaming traffic volumes will drive incremental technology interoperability and clearinghouse transaction volumes for the industry 

table of contents the growth of sms and mms messaging is also driving significant operational challenges for wireless operators 
cross operator sms messaging and mms messaging requires extensive network connectivity and complex message protocol conversion between wireless operators 
operator grade message translation and routing are critical to wireless operators who increasingly rely on messaging services to drive incremental revenue growth and to improve customer retention 
according to portio research  worldwide sms traffic is expected to grow from trillion in to trillion in a compound annual growth rate of around percent  with this growth expected to be driven by a surge in the sms traffic in asia pacific 
worldwide mms traffic is expected to grow from billion in to billion in a compound annual growth rate of around percent  and this growth is expected to be driven by the surge in mms traffic in the asia pacific and european regions 
in september  we announced we are working with colibria to develop an advanced messaging hub solution 
this solution  named syniverse next  provides interworking between operators for the exchange of presence data  instant messaging im  sms  and mms messages across networks  protocols and message types 
operators will be able to offer their subscribers more interactive  intuitive and convenient presence based messaging services  and give those subscribers the ability to spontaneously communicate and share experiences with individuals  groups and social networking communities 
we have structured our agreement with colibria as a joint development agreement where we each bring our core capabilities to develop a solution where we will own the intellectual property 
the emergence of mobile data and premium content services are also driving operator demand for clearinghouse services  translation services and roaming facilitation services 
this growth has been and will continue to be supported by the deployment of next generation wireless data networks 
we believe the increase in wireless data roaming will drive the need for wireless data clearinghouse services that simplify network connectivity and the exchange of invoicing data between multiple operators 
network services ss networks are a core element of today s telecommunications infrastructure 
ss is the telecommunications industry s standard network signaling protocol used by substantially all operators to enable the setup and delivery of telephone calls and to offer enhanced calling features like caller id 
outsourced network services provide operators cost effective  single point connectivity to an ss network  other widely used communication networks and critical databases 
as a result  operators avoid the cost and complexity of managing individual network connections to multiple operators  eliminate the expense of licensing and maintaining intelligent network revenues databases and reduce the need for building capital intensive network infrastructure 
drivers of network services include wireless subscriber growth  wireless roaming call volume growth  wireless roaming data growth and sms messaging volume growth 
in addition  wireless data roaming requires operators to support packet switched  internet protocol based communications protocols including general packet radio service  or gprs  high speed packet access  or hspa  x radio transmission technology  or xrtt  and x evolution data optimized  or xev do technology designed to double voice capacity and support faster data transmission 
technology service providers support wireless data roaming services and enable subscribers to access their home wireless data services such as public internet  corporate intranets  e mail and m commerce while abroad or beyond the reach of their home network 
the emergence of internet protocol based signaling solutions and database services associated with voip will also require network  routing and translation services to communicate with legacy networks 
voip offers traditional voice telephone services but at a significantly lower cost by bypassing the traditional telephone network 
in february  we launched our ip packet exchange network transport solution  or ipx  to help global operators keep up with increasing volumes while maintaining quality of service for subscribers 
ipx provides 
table of contents operators access to a full suite of mobile data services via a single ubiquitous network while supporting emerging g plus solutions 
via this global network solution  operators connect to a single network to utilize a full suite of wireless data services 
this approach means operators can reduce costs by adding additional services or increasing capacity without needing to connect to additional networks 
number portability services in  the united states federal communications commission  or fcc  mandated number portability services to encourage competition by permitting wireless subscribers to change operators while retaining their current telephone numbers 
in  canadian regulators also mandated wireless number portability 
other jurisdictions around the world are currently mandating or are analyzing the need for the implementation of number portability services 
to facilitate the portability of wireless telephone numbers  operators exchange information with other operators and transmit information to regional number portability databases in order to support call routing 
implementation of number portability services impacts nearly every system within operator operations including network signaling and routing  switching  billing  point of sale and customer care 
technology service providers enable wireless operators to implement number portability services to their customers by streamlining the ordering and communication processes that organize  prioritize and route number portability transactions between wireless operators and industry databases 
these services must be able to route and track the multiple transactions involved in porting numbers between service providers  identify and facilitate problem resolution  manage the unique challenges of porting between fixed line and wireless operators  and interface to operators who have chosen less automated porting solutions 
following the introduction of number portability services in the us  the wireless industry experienced rapid consumer adoption 
we expect the drivers of number portability services demand will be continued increase in the number of wireless subscribers  operator competition and increased regulatory focus  and adoption of number portability services in other countries around the world 
call processing services call processing solutions support the proper authentication  handling and routing of telephone calls in order to reduce fraud and to allow cdma wireless subscribers to make and accept telephone calls while roaming on another operator s network 
wireless roaming growth is causing new call routing and delivery complexities for operators 
due to geographic and operator differences in subscriber verification  call delivery and signaling network protocols  these services require extensive data management capabilities 
drivers of call processing demand include international wireless subscriber growth and international wireless roaming call volume growth 
operators are increasingly using ss networks to replace traditional call processing functionality and to address wireless subscriber fraud issues

risk factors system failures  security breaches  delays and other problems could harm our reputation and business  cause us to lose customers and expose us to customer liability 
our success depends on our ability to provide reliable services to our customers 
our operations could be interrupted by any damage to or failure of our computer software or hardware  or our customers or suppliers computer software or hardware  our networks  our customers networks or our suppliers networks  and our connections and outsourced service arrangements with third parties 
our systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss  transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications failures  hurricanes  fires  earthquakes  floods and other natural disasters  interruption of service due to potential facility migrations  computer viruses or software defects  physical or electronic break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events  and errors by our employees or third party service providers 
because many of our services play a mission critical role for our customers  any damage to or failure of the infrastructure we rely on  including that of our customers and vendors  could disrupt the operation of our network and the provision of our services  result in the loss of current and potential customers and expose us to potential customer liability 
we depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues and the loss of any of our major customers would harm us 
our three largest customers for the year ended december  represented approximately of our revenues in the aggregate  while our ten largest customers for the year ended december  represented approximately of our revenues in the aggregate 
for the year ended december   we generated revenues from services provided to verizon communications  verizon wireless and their affiliates  which collectively is our largest customer  of approximately million  or of our revenues 
no other customer accounted for more than of our revenues for the year ended december  we expect to continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenues 
because our major customers represent such a large part of our business  the loss of any of our major customers would negatively impact our business 
most of our customer contracts do not provide for minimum payments at or near our historical levels of revenues from these customers 
although some of our customer contracts require our customers to make minimum payments to us  these minimum payments are substantially less than the revenues that we have historically earned from these customers 
if our customers decide for any reason not to continue to purchase services from us at current levels or at current prices  to terminate their contracts with us or not to renew their contracts with us  our revenues would decline 
future consolidation among our customers may cause us to lose transaction volume and reduce our prices  which would negatively impact our financial performance 
in the past  consolidation among our customers has caused us to lose transaction volume and to reduce prices 
in the future  our transaction volume and pricing may decline for similar reasons 
such consolidation activities may take the form of business combinations  strategic partnerships  or other business arrangements between the operators 
for example  during the second quarter of verizon wireless verizon announced that it would acquire alltel corporation alltel 
verizon completed its acquisition of alltel in january the impact to us of the consolidation is described under business developments in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may not be able to expand our customer base to make up any revenue declines if we lose customers or if our transaction volumes decline as a result of consolidation activities 
our attempts to diversify our customer base and reduce our reliance on particular customers may not be successful 
if we do not adapt to rapid technological change in the telecommunications industry  we could lose customers or market share 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new service introductions and changing customer demands 
significant technological changes could make our technology and services obsolete 
our success depends in part on our ability to adapt to our rapidly changing market by continually improving the features  functionality  reliability and responsiveness of our existing services and by successfully developing  introducing and marketing new features  services and applications to meet changing customer needs 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or respond successfully or in a cost effective way to adequately meet them 
our failure to do so would impair our ability to compete  retain customers or maintain our financial performance 
we sell our services primarily to telecommunications companies 
our future revenues and profits will depend  in part  on our ability to sell to new market participants 
the market for our services is intensely competitive and many of our competitors have significant advantages over us 
we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
increased competition could result in fewer customer orders  reduced pricing  reduced gross and operating margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 
we face competition from large  well funded providers of similar services  such as verisign  neustar  sybase  mach and other existing communications  billing and technology companies 
we are aware of major internet service providers  software developers and smaller entrepreneurial companies that are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing services that will compete with the services we offer 
we anticipate increased competition in the telecommunications industry and the entrance of new competitors into our business 
we expect that competition will remain intense in the near term and that our primary long term competitors may not yet have entered the market 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly more employees and greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
in addition  many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that they can use to their advantage 
our continued expansion into international markets is subject to uncertainties that could affect our operating results 
our growth strategy contemplates continued expansion of our operations into foreign jurisdictions 
international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous risks  including the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the us  us department of commerce export controls  tax rates in some foreign countries may exceed those of the us and foreign earnings may be subject to withholdings requirements or the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions  general economic and political conditions in the countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or not be favorable to our growth strategy  
table of contents unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  the difficulties associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various countries  the risk that foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities  and the potential difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries 
for the year ended december   of our total revenues excluding off network database queries were generated outside of north america as compared to for the year ended december  as we continue to expand our business globally  our success will depend  in large part  on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations 
however  any of these factors could result in higher costs or reduced revenues for our international operations 
the costs and difficulties of acquiring and integrating complementary businesses and technologies could impede our future growth  diminish our competitiveness and harm our operations 
as part of our growth strategy  we intend to consider acquiring complementary businesses 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets acquired  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks we could face with respect to acquisitions include greater than expected costs  management time and effort involved in identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions  potential disruption of our ongoing business and difficulty in maintaining our standards  controls  information systems and procedures  entering into markets and acquiring technologies in areas in which we have little experience  acquiring intellectual property which may be subject to various challenges from others  the inability to successfully integrate the services  products and personnel of any acquisition into our operations  the inability to achieve expected synergies  a need to incur debt  which may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses  or a need to issue equity securities  which may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders  and realizing little  if any  return on our investment 
integrating our operations with the bsg wireless operations may prove to be disruptive and could result in the combined businesses failing to meet our expectations 
we expect to integrate the operations of bsg wireless into our own and achieve certain cost saving synergies 
we cannot be sure that we will realize these anticipated benefits in full or at all 
achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition will depend  in part  upon whether the operations and personnel of bsg wireless can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner with our existing business 
our management team may encounter unforeseen difficulties in managing the integration of the two businesses 
additionally  difficulties in integration may result in adverse developments in our relationships with customers and suppliers 
the process of integrating formerly separately operated businesses may prove disruptive to both businesses  may take longer than we anticipate and may cause an interruption of and have a material adverse effect on our combined businesses 

table of contents even if we are able to successfully integrate the business of bsg wireless into our operations  we may not realize the anticipated cost saving synergies of the bsg wireless acquisition on the time table currently contemplated  or at all 
the bsg wireless acquisition was based  in part  on the expectation that the acquisition would result in various cost saving synergies 
even if we are able to successfully integrate the business of bsg wireless into our operations  there can be no assurance that we will realize the expected cost saving synergies on the timetable currently contemplated  or at all 
we expect to incur significant restructuring charges including severance and transition expenses in connection with these cost saving synergies 
achieving the expected cost saving synergies  as well as the costs of achieving them  is subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors 
if these factors limit our ability to achieve the expected cost saving synergies of the acquisition or if the related costs exceed our estimates  our expectations of future results of operations  including the cost saving synergies expected to result from the acquisition  may not be met 
additionally  the actions we take to achieve cost saving synergies could have unintended consequences that adversely affect our business 
if we encounter difficulties in achieving the expected cost saving synergies or do not achieve such cost saving synergies  we incur significantly greater costs related to such cost saving synergies than we anticipate or our activities related to such cost saving synergies have unintended consequences  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
difficulty in integrating technology may harm our business 
following the acquisition of bsg wireless  we have begun to integrate certain technology platforms 
this process may be slower or more difficult than we currently contemplate 
furthermore  we may encounter unanticipated difficulties in this process  which could cause integration difficulties and customer disruptions 
the measures that we have taken to date or plan to take in the future may not adequately resolve those issues 
if we fail to successfully integrate technology platforms  our ability to achieve cost efficiencies expected to result from the acquisition of bsg wireless may be impaired  which may adversely affect our future financial position  results of operations and customer relationships 
our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance at desired pricing levels or transaction volumes could impact our ability to maintain profitability or positive cash flow 
competition and industry consolidation have resulted in pricing pressure  which we expect to continue in the future and which we expect to continue to address through our volume based pricing strategy 
this pricing pressure could cause large reductions in the selling price of our services 
for example  consolidation in the wireless services industry in the united states over the past several years could give our customers increased transaction volume leverage in pricing negotiations 
our competitors or our customers in house solutions may also provide services at a lower cost  significantly increasing pricing pressures on us 
while historically pricing pressure has been largely offset by volume increases and the introduction of new services  in the future we may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions 
the inability of our customers to successfully implement our services could harm our business 
significant technical challenges can arise for our customers when they implement our services 
our customers ability to support the deployment of our services and integrate them successfully within their operations depends  in part  on our customers technological capabilities and the level of technological complexity involved 
difficulty in deploying those services could increase our customer service support costs  delay the recognition of revenues until the services are implemented and reduce our operating margins 
our reliance on third party providers for communications software  hardware and infrastructure exposes us to a variety of risks we cannot control 
our success depends on software  equipment  network connectivity and infrastructure hosting services supplied by our vendors and customers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to purchase the 
table of contents necessary software  equipment and services from these vendors on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to maintain current purchasing terms or ensure service availability with these vendors and customers  we may lose customers and experience an increase in costs in seeking alternative supplier services 
our business also depends upon the capacity  reliability and security of the infrastructure owned and managed by third parties  including our vendors and customers  that is used by our technology interoperability services  network services  number portability services  call processing services and enterprise solutions 
we have no control over the operation  quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure and whether those third parties will upgrade or improve their software  equipment and services to meet our and our customers evolving requirements 
we depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our services 
if one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service to us in the future  our operations could be severely interrupted 
in addition  rapid changes in the telecommunications industry have led to industry consolidation 
this consolidation may cause the availability  pricing and quality of the services we use to vary and could lengthen the amount of time it takes to deliver the services that we use 
capacity limits on our network and application platforms may be difficult to project and we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems to meet increased use 
as customers usage of our services increases  we will need to expand and upgrade our network and application platforms 
we may not be able to accurately project the rate of increase in usage of our services 
in addition  we may not be able to expand and upgrade  in a timely manner  our systems  networks and application platforms to accommodate increased usage of our services 
if we do not appropriately expand and upgrade our systems and networks and application platforms  we may lose customers and our operating performance may suffer 
financial and operating difficulties in the telecommunications sector may negatively affect our customers and our company 
historically  the telecommunications sector has experienced significant challenges resulting in excess capacity  poor operating results and financing difficulties 
because we operate in the telecommunications sector  we may also be negatively impacted 
while the sector has recently improved  some of our customers continue to have uncertain financial conditions 
the impact of these conditions on us could include slower collections on accounts receivable  higher bad debt expense  uncertainties due to possible customer bankruptcies  lower pricing on new customer contracts  lower revenues due to lower usage by the end customer and possible consolidation among our customers  which will put our customers and operating performance at risk 
we may need additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
we may require more capital in the future to fund our operations  enhance and expand the range of services we offer  maintain and expand our network  and respond to competitive pressures and potential strategic opportunities  such as investments  acquisitions and international expansion 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
the terms of available financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility 
in addition  our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to incur indebtedness or obtain financing 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be forced to reduce our operations or abandon expansion opportunities 

table of contents moreover  even if we are able to continue our operations  our failure to obtain additional financing could reduce our competitiveness as our competitors may provide better maintained networks or offer an expanded range of services 
our substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 
we have significant debt service obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding indebtedness of approximately million including the current portion of million 
we are the borrower of all of this outstanding indebtedness 
our substantial debt could have important consequences to investors 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital and development expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the manufacture  production  distribution or marketing of our services  customer demand  competitive pressures and the industries we serve  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged than we are  increase our vulnerability to both general and industry specific adverse economic conditions  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds 
we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
the addition of further debt to our current debt levels could intensify the leverage related risks that we now face 
in addition  our debt contains financial and other restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests 
our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default  which if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all our debts 
our stock price may be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations  changes in intellectual property rights of us or our competitors  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in product  pricing by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  announcements of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors  additions or departures of key personnel  and generally adverse market conditions 

table of contents we have anti takeover protections that may delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 
we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control and make any future unsolicited acquisition attempt more difficult 
on november   our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan which declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right the right for each outstanding share of common stock  par value per share the common shares  of the company 
the dividend was payable on november  to the stockholders of record on that date 
each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the company one one thousandth of a share a unit of series a junior participating preferred stock  par value per share the preferred shares  at a price of per one one thousandth of a preferred share the purchase price  subject to adjustment 
each unit has designations and powers  preferences and rights  and the qualifications  limitations and restrictions designed to make it the economic equivalent of a common share 
the description and terms of the rights are set forth in the rights agreement dated november  under the plan  the stock rights will become exercisable only when a public announcement or notice to syniverse has been made that a person or group has acquired  or obtained the right to acquire beneficial ownership of or more of the outstanding shares of syniverse s common shares  other than as a result of an offer approved by the board of directors of the company and ii business days or  if determined by the board of directors  a specified or unspecified later date following the commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer which  if successful  would cause the bidder to own of more of the outstanding common shares 
until a right is exercised  the holder thereof  as such  will have no rights as a stockholder of syniverse  other than rights resulting from such holder s ownership of common shares  including  without limitation  the right to vote or to receive dividends 
regulations affecting our customers and us and future regulations to which they or we may become subject may harm our business 
although we do not offer voice grade or data services that are deemed to be common carrier telecommunication services  certain of the services we offer are subject to regulation by the united states federal communications commission  or fcc  that could have an indirect effect on our business 
the us telecommunications industry has been subject to continuing deregulation since and the european and asian telecommunications industries are also subject to continued deregulation 
we cannot predict when  or upon what terms and conditions  further regulation or deregulation might occur or the effect regulation or deregulation may have on our business 
several services that we offer may be indirectly affected by regulations imposed upon potential users of those services  which may increase our costs of operations 
in addition  future services we may provide could be subject to direct regulation 
we may not be able to receive or retain licenses or authorizations that may be required for us to sell our services internationally 
the sales and marketing of our services internationally are subject to the us export control regime 
services of a commercial nature are subject to regulatory control by the department of commerce s bureau of export administration and to export administration regulations 
in the future  congress may require us to obtain export licenses or other export authorizations to export our services abroad  depending upon the nature of services being exported  as well as the country to which the export is to be made 
we cannot assure you that any of our applications for export licenses or other authorizations will be granted or approved 
furthermore  the export license export authorization process is often time consuming 
violation of export control regulations could subject us to fines and other penalties  such as losing the ability to export for a period of years  which would limit our revenue growth opportunities and significantly hinder our attempts to expand our business internationally 

table of contents failure to protect our intellectual property rights adequately may have a material adverse affect on our results of operations or our ability to compete 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights in the united states and in foreign countries through a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  as well as licensing agreements and agreements preventing the unauthorized disclosure and use of our intellectual property 
we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent competitors from copying or reverse engineering our services  or independently developing and marketing services that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own 
moreover  third parties may be able to successfully challenge  oppose  invalidate or circumvent our patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secret rights 
we may fail or be unable to obtain or maintain adequate protections for certain of our intellectual property in the united states or certain foreign countries or our intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the united states because of the differences in foreign trademark  patent and other laws concerning proprietary rights 
such failure or inability to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
monitoring and protecting our intellectual property rights is difficult and costly 
from time to time  we may be required to initiate litigation or other action to enforce our intellectual property rights or to establish their validity 
such action could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources and management attention and we cannot assure you that any such action will be successful 
if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights  it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and ability to compete 
we face the risk of claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties 
for example  significant litigation regarding patent rights exists in our industry 
our competitors in both the us and foreign countries  many of which have substantially greater resources than we have and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may have applied for or obtained  or may in the future apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our products and services 
we have not conducted an independent review of patents issued to third parties 
the large number of patents  the rapid rate of new patent issuances  the complexities of the technology involved and uncertainty of litigation increase the risk of business assets and management s attention being diverted to patent litigation 
it is possible that third parties will make claims of infringement against us or against our licenses in connection with their use of our technology 
any claims  even those without merit  could be expensive and time consuming to defend  cause us to cease making  licensing  using or selling equipment  services or products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  require us to redesign our equipment  services or products  if feasible  divert management s attention and resources  and require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary intellectual property 
any royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
a successful claim of infringement against us or one of our licensees in connection with a third party s use of our technology could result in our being required to pay significant damages  enter into costly license or royalty agreements or stop the sale of certain products  any of which could have a negative impact on our operating profits and harm our future prospects 

table of contents if our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  we may be required to indemnify our customers for any damages they suffer 
we generally indemnify our customers with respect to infringement by our products of the proprietary rights of third parties 
third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers 
these claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers  regardless of the merits of these claims 
if any of these claims succeed  we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use 
if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  our customers may be forced to stop using our products 
we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees 
our success also depends on our ability to attract  integrate  train  retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing personnel  both in the united states and abroad 
the loss of the services of any of our senior management team or other key employees or failure to attract  integrate  train  retain and motivate additional key employees could harm our business 
our customers may develop in house solutions and migrate part or all of the services that we provide them to these in house solutions 
we believe that certain customers may choose to internally deploy certain functionality currently provided by our services 
in recent years  we have experienced a loss of revenue streams from certain of our services as some of our customers have decided to meet their needs for these services in house 
for example  in order to manage the expense associated with the significant volume growth in mobile data  alltel and sprint have directly connected their ip backbone networks 
thus  they no longer use syniverse as a third party intermediary to manage the connectivity and exchange of billing records between their mobile data roaming platforms beginning in january fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 
a growing part of our business consists of sales made to customers outside the united states 
a portion of the net revenues we receive from such sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  portions of our cost of net revenues and our other operating expenses are incurred by our international operations and denominated in local currencies 
while fluctuations in the value of these net revenues  costs and expenses as measured in us dollars have not materially affected our results of operations historically  we cannot assure you that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material impact in the future 
in addition  our balance sheet reflects non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  including intercompany balances eliminated in consolidation  which can be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the current national and world wide financial crisis could adversely affect our operating results and stock price in a material manner 
general world wide economic conditions have recently deteriorated due to credit conditions resulting from the recent financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets  slower economic activity  concerns about inflation and deflation  volatility in energy costs  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the wireless communications markets 
these conditions make it difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  and they could cause us and foreign businesses to further slow spending on our services 
furthermore  during challenging economic times such as the current downturn  our customers may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit  which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us 
if that were to occur  we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our accounts 
table of contents receivable outstanding would be negatively impacted 
the current economic downturn and any future downturn may reduce our revenue or our percentage of revenue growth on a quarter to quarter basis 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery  world wide  or in the telecommunications industry or the wireless communications markets 
if the economy or the markets in which we operate do not improve from their current condition or if they continue to deteriorate  our customers or potential customers could continue to reduce or further delay their use of our services  which would adversely impact our revenues and ultimately our profitability 
in addition  we may record additional charges related to the restructuring of our business and the impairment of our goodwill and other long lived assets  and our business  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 
our revenues from roaming clearinghouse are dependant upon subscribers continuing to travel 
worsening economic conditions may impact the frequency with which subscribers travel and consequently decrease our revenues 
demand for our services is driven primarily by wireless voice and data traffic  subscriber roaming activity  sms and mms messaging  number porting and next generation ip applications 
the global wireless telecommunications industry is expected to grow due to continued subscriber growth  increased usage and deployment of new services 
however  changes in subscriber usage patterns could be affected in any recession or economic downturn in the united states or any other country where we do business and could negatively impact the number of transactions processed and adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
if the national and world wide financial crisis intensifies  potential disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our business  including the availability and cost of short term funds for liquidity requirements and banks ability to meet long term commitments  each of which could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets  as have been experienced during  could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities 
our access to funds under our revolving credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding commitments 
those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from us and other borrowers within a short period of time 
for example  in  lehman commercial paper inc lehman cpi filed a petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code with the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
lehman cpi is the administrative agent of our senior credit facility 
lehman cpi has million percent of the million in commitments under our undrawn revolving credit line 
it is doubtful lehman cpi will honor its obligations under the revolving credit line 
longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty  changing or increased regulation  reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business 
any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged 
such measures could include deferring capital expenditures  acquisition activities or other discretionary uses of cash 
our financial results may be adversely affected if we have to impair our intangible assets or goodwill 
as a result of our acquisitions  a significant portion of our total assets consist of intangible assets including goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets  net of amortization  together accounted for approximately and of the total assets on our balance sheet as of december  and december   respectively 
we may not realize the full fair value of our intangible assets and goodwill 
we expect to engage in additional acquisitions  which may result in our recognition of additional intangible assets and goodwill 
under current accounting standards  we are able to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset  while goodwill is not amortized 
we evaluate on a regular basis whether all or a portion of our goodwill intangible assets may be impaired 
under current accounting rules  any determination that impairment has occurred would 
table of contents require us to write off the impaired portion of goodwill and such intangible assets  resulting in a charge to our earnings 
such a write off could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations
