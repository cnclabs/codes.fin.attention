table of contents impact to discontinued operations in conjunction with our audit of the nine months results of sunpower  we identified certain amounts that did not belong in the nine month period that is consolidated with our results 
the impact of this adjustment totaled million 
stock based compensation the reduction of stock based compensation expense was primarily a result of the non achievement of certain performance based restricted stock units granted in fiscal that was contingent upon our performance relative to a pre determined peer group 
at the time of the press release  management was unable to determine whether the achievement had been met as certain companies in the peer group had not publicly reported their financial results 
since the issuance of our press release  these companies have reported their results and we were able to determine that the milestone related to these performance based restricted stock units have not been achieved 
as a result  we reduced our stock based compensation by million for the year ended december  inventory reserve in connection with our exit from our texas facility  we completed a final build of a substantial volume of inventory for certain products previously manufactured at this facility 
subsequent to year end and in view of the continuing deteriorating economic conditions  we determined a demand reserve of approximately million was required

these adjustments were similar to the provisions in the plans providing for automatic adjustment of service provider equity awards and share pools pursuant to a cypress stock split or similar change in capitalization effected without receipt of consideration by cypress 
specifically  the board approved amendments to make proportionate adjustments effective immediately following the spin off to a the number of authorized but unissued shares reserved for issuance under the plans  b the numerical provisions under the plans annual grant limits and automatic option grant sections  including automatic grants to board members  and c outstanding employee equity awards  including stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock awards  under the plans to preserve the intrinsic value of the awards before and after the spin off 
the board further approved the amendment of outstanding options under the plans to permit  subject to timing limitations and management discretion  both net exercise a portion of the shares subject to options surrendered as payment of the aggregate exercise price and early exercise exercise of unvested shares subject to a stock restriction agreement

these changes included a proportionate adjustment in the offering date price per share of cypress s common stock and maximum number of shares participants may purchase under the espp 
on september   following the spin off  outstanding employee equity awards under the plans were adjusted by a conversion ratio of the conversion ratio 
specifically  the number of shares issuable pursuant to the outstanding awards was multiplied by the conversion ratio  rounded down to the nearest whole share 
in addition  the per share exercise price of options 
table of contents was divided by the conversion ratio  rounded up to the nearest whole cent 
also  the number of authorized but unissued shares reserved for issuance under the plans and the espp and the numerical provisions under the plans annual grant limits and automatic option grant provisions  including automatic grants to board members  were multiplied by the conversion ratio  rounded down to the nearest whole share 
the espp offering date price for the current offering period was divided by the conversion ratio  rounded up to the nearest whole cent and the maximum number of shares participants may purchase under the espp was multiplied by the conversion ratio  rounded down to the nearest whole share 
the modification of the outstanding employee equity awards and the espp on august  resulted in additional non cash stock based compensation 
the amount was measured based upon the difference between the fair value of the awards immediately before and after the modification 
of the total additional non cash stock based compensation  million  net of forfeitures was recognized in fiscal and the remaining million will be recognized over the remaining vesting periods on an accelerated basis 
convertible debt tender offer in september  cypress completed a tender offer to purchase for cash up to million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding convertible senior notes notes 
in total million aggregate principal amount of the notes were tendered 
in accordance with the terms of the tender offer  cypress accepted million of the tendered notes at a purchase price of  per  principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
because more than million principal amount was tendered  cypress purchased the notes on a pro rata basis 
the pro ration was based on the ratio of the principal amount of the notes tendered by a holder to the total principal amount of the notes tendered by all the holders 
as a result of the tender offer  cypress paid million in cash and recorded a debt extinguishment loss of million in the third quarter of fiscal pursuant to the indenture  the spin off of sunpower see note of notes to consolidated financial statements constituted both a fundamental change and a make whole fundamental change to the notes 
consequently  the remaining holders were permitted to require cypress to purchase their notes on december   the fundamental change purchase date  in cash at a price equal to  principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the fundamental change purchase date 
on december   cypress repurchased million of the notes 
acquisition in september  cypress completed the acquisition of simtek corporation simtek  a publicly traded manufacturer of non volatile static random access memory nvsram integrated circuits used in a variety of systems 
simtek s nvsram products provide the high speed memory access of standard sram s  but retain data when power is turned off a feature critical to applications where secure data storage is essential to system functionality 
the acquisition will enable cypress to integrate simtek s nvsram technology into many of cypress s products  providing a highly integrated control and power failure solution for complex analog and digital systems and accelerating acceptance of cypress s products in various applications and markets 
the total purchase consideration of the acquisition was million 
goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal we performed our annual assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill balance 
as a result of the significant negative industry and economic trends affecting our current operations and expected future growth as well as the general decline of industry valuations impacting our valuation  we determined that our goodwill  including the goodwill applicable to the simtek acquisition was impaired 
we recorded an impairment loss of million for the year ended december  
table of contents manufacturing strategy our core manufacturing strategy flexible manufacturing combines capacity from leading foundries with output from cypress s internal manufacturing facilities 
this initiative allows us to meet rapid swings in customer demand while lessening the burden of high fixed costs  a capability that is particularly important in high volume consumer markets that we serve with our leading programmable product portfolio 
consistent with this strategy  our board approved a plan in december to exit our manufacturing facility in texas and transfer production to our more cost competitive facility in minnesota and outside foundries 
since all of cypress s newer products are being designed on more advanced process technologies  management believes that it is more cost effective to shift manufacturing elsewhere than to retool the facility in texas 
in addition  management believes that there is currently sufficient cost competitive foundry capacity in asia enabling cypress to achieve lower manufacturing costs 
the texas facility ceased operations as of the end of fiscal conversion of distributors prior to fiscal  cypress had sales agreements with certain independent distributors in asia  including japan  that did not provide these distributors with price protection or rights of return 
as such  revenues were recognized upon shipment 
during the first quarter of fiscal  cypress negotiated new terms with these distributors 
under the new terms  these distributors were provided with allowances such as price protection and stock rotation rights 
given the uncertainties associated with the rights provided to these distributors  revenues and costs related to sales to these distributors are deferred until the products are sold by the distributors to the end customers 
the objective of this conversion is to enable us in the long term to achieve higher gross margin dollars in asia as the new terms also enhance our ability to manage the end customer sales 
in addition  we will be able to provide design registration for our rapidly growing proprietary businesses and align our distribution and revenue recognition policies consistently across the world 
as a result of changing the terms of these distributor agreements  we were required to change from recognizing revenue at the time of shipment to recognizing revenue upon sales to the ultimate end customers 
the impact of this change resulted in the deferral of approximately million of revenue that would have been recognized under the previous sales terms  and an increase in our net loss of approximately million for the first quarter of fiscal results of operations revenues year ended december  december  december  in thousands consumer and computation division data communications division memory and imaging division other total revenues consumer and computation division revenues from the consumer and computation division decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the distributor conversion contributed million of the decrease between fiscal periods 
after giving effect to the distributor conversion  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in sales of our usb products and million in sales of our general purpose timing solutions mainly due to softening demand as a result of the economic

revenues from the consumer and computation division increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in sales of our psoc solutions  driven by new design wins  expansion of our customer base and continued market penetration in a variety of end market applications 
in addition  the increase was attributable to the continued adoption of our family of usb products in pc applications and consumer devices  which contributed an increase of million in revenues

revenues from the data communications division decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in sales of our network search engine products as we divested the product families in fiscal and our specialty memory products due to the continued slowdown in demand in the base station market 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in sales of our new west bridge controllers due to increased production and shipments to certain cell phone manufacturers 
memory and imaging division revenues from the memory and imaging division decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the distributor conversion contributed million of the decrease between fiscal periods 
after giving effect to the distributor conversion  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in sales of our pseudo sram products as they were discontinued in fiscal  offset by a million increase in sales of other memory products due to increased demand for consumer and communication applications 
revenues from the memory and imaging division decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in sales of our pseudo sram product families as these products were discontinued in fiscal the decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in sales of other memory products due to increased demand for networking and communications applications 
other revenues from the other segment decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the divestiture of our silicon valley technology center svtc business in fiscal  which contributed million of revenues in fiscal

in addition  stock based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenues increased million mainly due to the modification of the outstanding employee equity awards approved by the board in connection with the spin off 
gross margin has also been impacted by the timing of inventory adjustments related to inventory write downs and the subsequent sale of these written down products caused by the general state of our business 
during fiscal  the net impact of the inventory adjustments was a charge of million compared to a charge of million in fiscal the decrease in the gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the divestiture of our high margin svtc business in fiscal  coupled with the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs in our manufacturing facilities

as a result of the transaction  we recognized a gain of million during fiscal impairment of investments the following table summarizes the impairment loss related to our investments year ended december  december  december  in thousands  except per share amounts debt securities commercial paper auction rate securities corporate bonds equity securities marketable equity securities non marketable equity securities total impairment loss auction rate securities auction rate securities are investments with contractual maturities generally between and years 
they are usually found in the form of municipal bonds  preferred stock  a pool of student loans or collateralized debt obligations with interest rates resetting every to days through an auction process 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell when the auction market is performing as intended or continue to hold the securities at par 
the auction rate securities held by us are primarily backed by student loans and are over collateralized  insured and guaranteed by the us federal department of education 
as of december   all auction rate securities held by us were rated as either aaa or aaa by the major independent rating agencies 
subsequent to the year end  of the student loan auction rate securities have been downgraded from aaa to baa the downgrade event was due to the higher rates the issuer is paying out versus the lending rates  which is preventing the issuer from building excess spread as required under the prospectus 
if the financial market continues to deteriorate  future downgrades could potentially impact the rating of our auction rate securities 
as of december   all of our auction rate securities have experienced failed auctions due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
currently  these failures are not believed to be a credit issue with the underlying investments  but rather caused by a lack of 
table of contents liquidity 
under the contractual terms  the issuer is obligated to pay penalty rates should an auction fail 
the funds associated with failed auctions are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
given these circumstances and the lack of liquidity  we have classified our auction rate securities totaling million as long term investments as of december  during fiscal  we performed analyses to assess the fair value of the auction rate securities 
in the absence of a liquid market to value these securities  we prepared a valuation model based on discounted cash flows 
the assumptions used for the fourth quarter of fiscal were as follows years to liquidity  continued receipt of amounts that approximate the contractual interest which provides a premium spread for failed auctions  and discount rates of  which incorporates a spread for both credit and liquidity risk 
based on these assumptions  we estimated that the auction rate securities would be valued at approximately of their stated par value as of december   representing a decline in value of approximately million 
given the prolonged lack of liquidity in the market for auction rate securities and the continued decline in the valuation of these investments  management determined that the decline in value was other than temporary and recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal equity securities we have equity investments in both public and privately held companies 
we recognize an impairment charge when the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is deemed other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge on an investment in a public company  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
our impairment assessment on investments in privately held companies includes the review of each investee s financial condition  the business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and discounted cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or others 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount  we presume that the investment is impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise 
we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  as we determined that the decline in value of our equity investments in certain public and privately held companies was other than temporary 
employee deferred compensation plan we have a deferred compensation plan  which provides certain key employees  including our executive management  with the ability to defer the receipt of compensation in order to accumulate funds for retirement on a tax free basis 
we do not make contributions to the deferred compensation plan and we do not guarantee returns on the investments 
participant deferrals and investment gains and losses remain our assets and are subject to claims of general creditors

the tax expense in fiscal was primarily attributable to non us taxes on income earned in certain countries that was not offset by current year net operating losses in other countries  partially offset by the amortization of purchased intangibles and a release of previously accrued taxes 
our effective tax rate varies from the us statutory rate primarily due to our assessment of the utilization of loss carryovers and earnings of foreign subsidiaries taxed at different rates 
deferred tax assets of million at december  were fully reserved due to the uncertainty of realization of the assets 
during fiscal  cypress completed the sale of million shares of sunpower s common stock which resulted in a gain of million from the transaction 
alternative minimum tax has been accrued on the taxable portion of the gain remaining after offset by net operating loss carryovers and foreign tax credits 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we regularly assess our tax positions in light of legislative  bilateral tax treaty  regulatory and judicial developments in the many countries in which we and our affiliates do business

liquidity convertible debt in september  cypress completed a tender offer to purchase for cash up to million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
in total million aggregate principal amount of the notes were tendered 
in accordance with the terms of the tender offer  cypress accepted million of the validly tendered notes at a purchase price of  per  principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
because more than million principal amount was tendered  cypress purchased the notes on a pro rata basis 
the pro ration was based on the ratio of the principal amount of the notes tendered by a holder to the total principal amount of the notes tendered by all the holders 
as a result of the tender offer  cypress paid million in cash in the third quarter of fiscal in november  cypress made open market purchases of approximately million of the outstanding notes at a slight discount to par  plus accrued interest 
pursuant to the applicable indenture  the spin off of sunpower constituted both a fundamental change and a make whole fundamental change to the notes 
consequently  the remaining holders were permitted to require cypress to purchase their notes on december    in cash at a price equal to  principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the fundamental change purchase date 
on december   cypress repurchased the principal amount of million of the notes 
holders who did not have their notes repurchased by cypress maintain the right to convert their notes in accordance with and subject to the terms of the indenture 
the notes are initially convertible  subject to certain conditions  into cash up to the lesser of the principal amount of the notes or the conversion value 
if the conversion value of the notes is greater than  then the excess conversion value will be convertible into cash or shares of cypress s common stock  or a combination of cash and shares  at cypress s election 
as of december   the conversion price of the notes was per share 
as of december  we have million outstanding and holders cannot currently convert  but will have the right to convert after june  holders who convert after june  will not receive a make whole adjustment unless there is another fundamental change 
the amount that will be paid on conversion will be calculated based on the trading days beginning on august   the nd trading day prior to the maturity date of september  auction rate securities as of december   all of our auction rate securities have experienced failed auctions due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
currently  these failures are not believed to be a credit issue with the underlying investments  but rather caused by a lack of liquidity 
we have classified our auction rate securities totaling million as long term investments as of december  during fiscal  we performed analyses to assess the fair value of the auction rate securities 
in the absence of a liquid market to value these securities  we prepared a valuation model based on discounted cash flows 
based on the discounted cash flows  we estimated that the auction rate securities would be valued at approximately of their stated par value as of december  given the prolonged lack of liquidity in the market for auction rate securities and the continued decline in the valuation of these investments  management determined that the decline in value was other than temporary and recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal 
table of contents stock repurchase program in fiscal  the board authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million 
in fiscal  the board approved an additional million  bringing the total amount that may be used for stock purchases to million under the stock repurchase program 
stock repurchases under the program may be made through open market and privately negotiated transactions at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price  corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions 
the program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice

purchase obligations are defined as enforceable agreements that are legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including quantity  price and timing 
as of december   our unrecognized tax benefits were million  which were classified as long term liabilities 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments  if any  in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing or outcomes of either actual or anticipated tax audits 
as a result  this amount is not included in the table above 
capital resources and financial condition our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and debt securities 
as of december   in addition to million in cash and cash equivalents  we had million invested in short term investments for a total cash and short term investment position of million that is available for use in current operations 
in addition  we had million of long term investments primarily consisting of auction rate securities 

table of contents we believe that liquidity provided by existing cash  cash equivalents and investments and our borrowing arrangements will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  should prevailing economic conditions and or financial  business and other factors beyond our control adversely affect our estimates of our future cash requirements  we could be required to fund our cash requirements by alternative financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if needed  would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all

off balance sheet arrangement during fiscal  we entered into a strategic foundry partnership with grace semiconductor manufacturing corporation grace  pursuant to which we have transferred certain of our proprietary process technologies to grace s shanghai  china facility 
in accordance with a foundry agreement executed in fiscal  we purchase wafers from grace that are produced using these process technologies 
pursuant to a master lease agreement  grace has leased certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment from a financing company 
in conjunction with the master lease agreement  we have entered into a series of guarantees with the financing company for the benefit of grace 
under the guarantees  we have agreed to unconditional guarantees to the financing company of the rental payments payable by grace for the leased equipment under the master lease agreement 
if grace fails to pay any of the quarterly rental payments  we will be obligated to pay such outstanding amounts within days of a written demand from the financing company 
if we fail to pay such amount  interest will accrue at a rate of per annum on any unpaid amounts 
to date  we have not been required to make any payments under these guarantees 
pursuant to the guarantees  we issued irrevocable letters of credit to secure the rental payments under the guarantees in the event a demand is made by the financing company on us 
the amount available under the letters of credit will decline according to schedules mutually agreed upon by us and the financing company 
if we default  the financing company will be entitled to draw on the letters of credit

the disclosures shall be provided for fiscal years ending after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of fsp r critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k and the data used to prepare them 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in the course of such preparation 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and financial instruments  stock based compensation  litigation and settlement costs  and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by significant estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition we generate revenues by selling products to distributors  various types of manufacturers including original equipment manufacturers oem s and electronic manufacturing service providers ems s 
we recognize revenue on sales to oem s and ems s provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 

table of contents sales to certain distributors are made under agreements which provide the distributors with price protection  other allowances and stock rotation under certain circumstances 
given the uncertainties associated with the rights given to these distributors  revenues and costs related to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the end customers 
revenues are recognized upon receiving notification from those distributors that products have been sold to the end customers 
reported information includes product resale price  quantity and end customer shipment information as well as remaining inventory on hand 
at the time of shipment to those distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to receive payment  relieve inventory for the value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributors  and defer the related margin as deferred revenue less cost of revenue on sales to distributors in the consolidated balance sheets 
the effects of distributor price adjustments are recorded as a reduction to deferred revenue at the time the distributors sell the products to the end customers 
we record as a reduction to revenues reserves for sales returns  price protection and allowances  based upon historical experience rates and for any specific known customer amounts 
we also provide certain distributors and ems s with volume pricing discounts  such as rebates and incentives  which are recorded as a reduction to revenues at the time of sale 
historically these volume discounts have not been significant 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent  accurate and timely data from our distributors 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
because the data set is large and complex and because there may be errors in the reported data  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
actual results could vary materially from those estimates 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by considering factors such as historical bad debt experience  specific customer creditworthiness  the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic trends that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if the data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our results of operations could be materially affected 
valuation of inventories management periodically reviews the adequacy of our inventory reserves 
we record a write down for our inventories which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
we perform a detailed review of inventories each quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts  product life cycle status  product development plans and current sales levels 
inventory reserves are not relieved until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
our inventories may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to record additional write downs  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
for example  during the fourth quarter of based upon current economic conditions  we evaluated the demand forecast related to these long term builds and determined a demand reserve of approximately million was required 
valuation of long lived assets our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities and equipment that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly under utilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand 
in addition  we have recorded intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions 

table of contents we evaluate our long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analysis 
if there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges on our long lived assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we performed an impairment analysis for our long lived assets and determined that there was no impairment 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we tested our goodwill on the reporting unit level 
the following table indicates the number of reporting units tested for goodwill and the amount of goodwill impairment recorded in each reportable segment reportable segments number of reporting units goodwill impairment consumer and computation division three million data communications division two million memory and imaging division two million management determined the fair value of the reporting units using a combination of the income approach  which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis of each reporting unit  and the market approach  which is based on a competitor multiple assessment  if available 
the following table indicates the weight given to each of the approaches reportable segments income approach market approach consumer and computation division data communications division memory and imaging division the following table summarizes the assumptions used in the income approach reportable segments five year annual growth rates terminal values discount rates consumer and computation division data communications division memory and imaging division the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows  including the discount rates and estimated terminal values  reflect management s best estimates 
the discount rates were based upon our weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the risks associated with our operations 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
we performed our annual assessment of the carrying value of our 
table of contents goodwill balance during the fourth quarter of fiscal because of the significant negative industry and economic trends affecting our current operations and expected future growth as well as the general decline of industry valuations impacting our valuation  we determined that a portion of our goodwill was other than temporarily impaired and recorded an impairment loss of million for the year ended december  except for one reporting unit in our consumer and computation division  we recorded an impairment loss on all of our goodwill associated with the other six reporting units 
we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our annual impairment test are reasonable  but they are judgmental  and variations in any of the assumptions or rates could result in materially different calculations of impairment amounts 
the sum of the fair values of the reporting units was reconciled to our current market capitalization based upon our stock price plus an estimated control premium 
given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn  or the period or strength of recover  made for purposes or our goodwill impairment testing during the three months ended december  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or growth rates on our remaining reporting unit is not achieved  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods  whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing the fourth quarter of fiscal or prior to that  if any such change constitutes a triggering event outside of the quarter from when the annual goodwill impairment test is performed 
fair value of financial instruments effective december   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
our financial assets and financial liabilities that require recognition under sfas no 
include available for sale investments  employee deferred compensation plan and foreign currency derivatives 
sfas no 
establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
as such  fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment 
financial assets utilizing level inputs include us treasuries  most money market funds  marketable equity securities and our employee deferred compensation plan  level valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable  directly or indirectly 
financial assets and liabilities utilizing level inputs include foreign currency forward exchange contracts  most commercial paper and corporate notes and bonds  and level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
financial assets utilizing level inputs primarily include auction rate securities 
we use an income approach valuation model to estimate the exit price of the auction rate securities  which is derived as the weighted average present value of expected cash flows over various periods of illiquidity  using a risk adjusted discount rate that is based on the credit risk and liquidity risk of the securities 

table of contents availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and to the extent that valuation is based on inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market  the determination of fair value requires more judgment 
accordingly  the degree of judgment exercised by our management in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
in regards to our auction rate securities  the income approach valuation model was based on both level credit quality and interest rates and level inputs 
we determined that the level inputs were the most significant to the overall fair value measurement  particularly the estimates of risk adjusted discount rates and ranges of expected periods of illiquidity 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million on our auction rate securities as we determined that the decline in the value of these investments was other than temporary 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our future stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded 
litigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement payments 
if that occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation is probable  and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such litigation  we will record the loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could require us to record additional legal costs 
accounting for income taxes our global operations involve manufacturing  research and development and selling activities 
profits from non us activities are subject to local country taxes but are not subject to us tax until repatriated to the us in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we approved a special one time repatriation of million from our foreign earnings 
it is our intention to permanently reinvest the remaining earnings outside the us we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination is made 

table of contents the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risks our investment portfolio consists of a variety of financial instruments that exposes us to interest rate risk  including  but not limited to  money market funds  commercial paper and corporate securities 
these investments are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our balance sheets at fair market value with their related unrealized gain or loss reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
due to the relatively short term nature of our investment portfolio  we do not believe that an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we believe we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
auction rate securities as of december   we have classified all of our auction rate securities as level financial instruments 
auction rate securities are investments with contractual maturities generally between and years 
the auction rate securities held by us are primarily backed by student loans and are over collateralized  insured and guaranteed by the us federal department of education 
as of december   all auction rate securities held by us were rated as either aaa or aaa by the major independent rating agencies 
subsequent to the year end  of the student loan auction rate securities have been downgraded from aaa to baa the downgrade event was due to the higher rates the issuer is paying out versus the lending rates  which is preventing the issuer from building excess spread as required under the prospectus 
if the financial market continues to deteriorate  future downgrades could potentially impact the rating of our auction rate securities 
as of december   all of our auction rate securities have experienced failed auctions due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
currently  these failures are not believed to be a credit issue with the underlying investments  but rather caused by a lack of liquidity 
under the contractual terms  the issuer is obligated to pay penalty rates should an auction fail 
the funds associated with failed auctions are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
given these circumstances and the lack of liquidity  we have classified our auction rate securities totaling million as long term investments as of december  during fiscal  we performed analyses to assess the fair value of the auction rate securities 
in the absence of a liquid market to value these securities  we prepared a valuation model based on discounted cash flows 
the assumptions used for the fourth quarter of fiscal were as follows years to liquidity  continued receipt of contractual interest which provides a premium spread for failed auctions  and discount rates of  which incorporates a spread for both credit and liquidity risk 
based on these assumptions  we estimated that the auction rate securities would be valued at approximately of their stated par value as of december   representing a decline in value of approximately million 
given the prolonged lack of liquidity in the market for auction rate securities and the continued decline in the valuation of these investments  management determined that the decline in value was other than temporary and recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal the following table summarizes certain information related to our auction rate securities as of december  fair value fair value given a basis point increase in interest rates fair value given a basis point decrease in interest rates in thousands auction rate securities 
table of contents convertible debt the fair value of our convertible debt is subject to interest rate risk  market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature 
the fair value of the convertible debt will generally increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of the convertible debt will generally increase as our common stock prices increase and decrease as the stock prices fall 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our convertible debt but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations 
the following table summarizes certain information related to our convertible debt as of december  convertible debt fair value fair value given a increase in market prices fair value given a decrease in market prices in thousands convertible senior notes investments in publicly traded and privately held companies we have equity investments in certain publicly traded companies 
the marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale investments and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gain loss reported as a component in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of the common stock is subject to market price volatility 
the following table summarizes certain information related to these investments as of december  investments fair value fair value given a increase in stock prices fair value given a decrease in stock prices in thousands marketable equity securities we also have equity investments in several privately held companies  many of which are start ups or in development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
as our equity investments generally do not permit us to exert significant influence or control  these amounts generally represent our cost of the investments  less any adjustments we make when we determine that an investment s net realizable value is less than its carrying cost 
during fiscal  we recorded total impairment charges of million related to our investments in certain privately held companies as the carrying value of such investments exceeded the fair value and the decline in value was deemed other than temporary 
as of december   the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was million 
foreign currency exchange risk we operate and sell products in various global markets and purchase capital equipment using foreign currencies 
as a result  we are exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar may adversely affect our operating margins 
for example  when foreign currencies appreciate against the us dollar  inventory and expenses denominated in foreign currencies become more expensive 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive for international customers  thus potentially leading to a reduction in demand  our sales and profitability 
furthermore  many of our competitors are foreign companies that could benefit 
table of contents from such a currency fluctuation  making it more difficult for us to compete with those companies 
historically  we have conducted hedging activities that involve the use of currency forward contracts and options to minimize our exposure to changes in the foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and other currencies  however  we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business and results of operations
