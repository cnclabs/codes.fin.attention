as a prime contractor  principal subcontractor  partner  or preferred supplier  northrop grumman participates in many high priority defense and commercial technology programs in the us and abroad 
northrop grumman conducts most of its business with the us government  principally the dod 
the company also conducts business with local  state  and foreign governments and has domestic and international commercial sales

if the future economic environment continues to be less favorable than it has been in recent years  the company could experience difficulties if the financial viability of certain of its subcontractors and key suppliers is impaired 
in addition  the volatility in the financial markets has affected the valuation of the company s pension assets  resulting in higher pension costs in future periods 
adverse equity market conditions and the resulting decline in market multiples and the company s stock price have led to a non cash  after tax charge of billion for impairment of goodwill at shipbuilding and space technology 
if the financial markets continue to deteriorate causing further decline in the company s stock price and market capitalization  further impairments of goodwill and other long lived assets may become necessary 
the company s business is conducted primarily with us government customers under long term contracts and there have been no material changes to the company s product and service offerings due to the current economic conditions 
the us government s budgetary processes give the company good visibility regarding future 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation spending and the threat areas that they are addressing 
management believes that the company s current contracts  and its strong backlog of previously awarded contracts are well aligned with the direction of its customer s future needs  and this provides the company with good insight regarding future cash flows from its businesses 
nonetheless  management recognizes that no business is completely immune to the current economic situation and these economic conditions and the transition to a new presidential administration could adversely affect future defense spending levels which could lead to lower than expected revenues for the company in future years 
certain programs in which the company participates may be subject to potential reductions due to a slower rate of growth in the us defense budget forecasts and funds being utilized to support the on going global war on terrorism 
despite the trend of slower growth rates in the us defense budget  the company believes that its portfolio of technologically advanced  innovative products  services  and integrated solutions will generate revenue growth in and beyond 
based on total backlog funded and unfunded of approximately billion as of december   the company expects sales in of approximately billion 
the major industry and economic factors that may affect the company s future performance are described in the following paragraphs 
industry factors northrop grumman is subject to the unique characteristics of the us defense industry as a monopsony  and by certain elements peculiar to its own business mix 
northrop grumman  along with lockheed martin corporation  the boeing company  raytheon company  and general dynamics corporation are among the largest companies in the us defense industry at this time 
northrop grumman competes against these and other companies for a number of programs  both large and small 
intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of northrop grumman s business and the defense industry 
it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies 
a company competing to be a prime contractor may  upon ultimate award of the contract to another party  turn out to be a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party 
it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts 
the nature of major defense programs  conducted under binding contracts  allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 
the company s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and services  as well as its ability to provide the people  technologies  facilities  equipment  and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency 
it is necessary to maintain  as the company has  sources for raw materials  fabricated parts  electronic components  and major subassemblies 
in this manufacturing and systems integration environment  effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations 
similarly  there is intense competition among many companies in the information and services markets which is generally more labor intensive with competitive margin rates over contract periods of shorter duration 
competitors in the information and services markets include the defense industry participants mentioned above as well as many other large and small entities with expertise in various specialized areas 
the company s ability to successfully compete in the information and services markets depends on a number of factors  most important is the capability to deploy skilled professionals  many requiring security clearances  at competitive prices across the diverse spectrum of these markets 
accordingly  various workforce initiatives are in place to ensure the company is successful in attracting  developing and retaining sufficient resources to maintain or improve its competitive position within these markets 
liquidity trends in light of the current economic situation  the company has also evaluated its future liquidity needs  both from a short term and long term basis 
the company believes that cash on hand plus cash generated from operations along with cash available under credit lines are expected to be sufficient in to service debt  finance capital expansion projects  pay federal  foreign  and state income taxes  fund pension and other post retirement benefit plans  and continue paying dividends to shareholders 
the company has a committed 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation billion revolving credit facility  with a maturity date of august   that can be accessed on a same day basis 
to provide for long term liquidity  the company believes it can obtain additional capital  if necessary  from such sources as the public or private capital markets  the sale of assets  sale and leaseback of operating assets  and leasing rather than purchasing new assets 
the company has an effective shelf registration on file with the sec 
recent developments in us cost accounting standards cas pension recovery rules on september   the cas board published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anprm that if adopted would provide a framework to partially harmonize the cas rules with the pension protection act of ppa requirements 
the proposed cas rule includes provisions for a transition period from the existing cas requirement to a partially harmonized cas requirement 
after the ppa effective date for eligible government contractors including northrop grumman  which were granted a delay in their ppa effective date  the proposed rule would partially mitigate the near term mismatch between ppa amended erisa minimum contribution requirements which would not yet be recoverable under cas 
however  unless the final rule is revised  government contractors maintaining defined benefit pension plans in general would still experience a timing mismatch between required contributions and the cas recoverable pension costs 
it is anticipated that contractors will be entitled to seek an equitable adjustment to prices of previously negotiated contracts subject to cas for increased contract costs which result from mandatory changes required by the final rule 
the cas board is required to issue its final rule no later than january  economic opportunities  challenges  and risks the defense of the us and its allies requires the ability to respond to one or more regional conflicts  terrorist acts  or threats to homeland security and is increasingly dependent upon early threat identification 
national responses to those threats may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from dissuasion  deterrence  active defense  security and stability operations  or peacekeeping 
the company believes that the us government will continue to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry and on minimizing collateral damage when force must be applied in pursuit of national objectives 
as a result  the us and its military coalitions increasingly rely on sophisticated systems providing long range surveillance and intelligence  battle management  and precision strike capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy effective force to any region 
accordingly  defense procurement spending is expected to be weighted toward the development and procurement of military platforms and systems demonstrating the stealth  long range  survivability  persistence and standoff capabilities that can overcome such obstacles to access 
additionally  advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual systems and provide for the real time integration of individual surveillance  information management  strike  and battle management platforms will also be required 
while the upward trend in overall defense spending may slow  the company does not expect defense requirements to change significantly in the foreseeable future 
many allied countries are focusing their development and procurement efforts on advanced electronics and information systems capabilities to enhance their interoperability with us forces 
the size of future us and international defense budgets is expected to remain responsive to the international security environment 
while the political environment currently does not allow for a thorough insight into the fiscal budget  it is expected defense spending will continue to grow in the near term  though probably more modestly than in the past 
it is possible the new administration s proposed budget will include reductions in certain programs in which the company participates or for which the company expects to compete  however the company believes that spending on recapitalization and modernization of homeland security and defense assets will continue to be a national priority  with particular emphasis on areas involving intelligence  persistent surveillance  cyber space  energy saving technologies and non conventional warfare capabilities 
us government programs in which the company either participates  or strives to participate  must compete with other programs for consideration during the us budget formulation and appropriation processes 
budget 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation decisions made in this environment will have long term consequences for the size and structure of the company and the entire defense industry 
substantial new competitive opportunities for the company include the next generation long range bomber  space radar  unmanned vehicles  satellite communications systems  restricted programs  technical services and information technology contracts  and numerous international and homeland security programs 
in pursuit of these opportunities  northrop grumman continues to focus on operational and financial performance for continued growth in and beyond 
northrop grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in high technology areas such as stealth  airborne and space surveillance  battle management  systems integration  defense electronics  and information technology 
the company has a significant presence in federal and civil information systems  the manufacture of combatant ships including aircraft carriers and submarines  space technology  cisr  and missile systems 
the company believes that its programs are a high priority for national defense 
nevertheless  under budgetary pressures  there remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced  extended  or terminated by the company s us government customers 
the company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of non conforming items for a specified period of time 
most of the company s product warranties are provided under government contracts  the costs of which are generally incorporated into contract pricing 
prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations  including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act  with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines  penalties  debarment  or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies 
given the company s dependence on us government business  suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company

business acquisitions in october  the company acquired international  inc for approximately million in cash 
provides geospatial data production and analysis  including airborne imaging  surveying  mapping and geographic information systems for us and international government intelligence  defense and civilian customers 
the operating results of are reported in the information technology segment from the date of acquisition 
the consolidated financial statements reflect preliminary estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related allocation of the purchase price for the entities acquired 
management does not expect adjustments to these estimates  if any  to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
during the third quarter of  the company acquired xinetics inc  reported in the space technology segment  and the remaining percent of scaled composites  llc  reported in the integrated systems segment  for an aggregate amount of approximately million in cash 
in july  the company and science applications international corporation saic reorganized the amsec  llc joint venture amsec  by dividing amsec along customer and product lines 
amsec is a full service supplier that provides engineering  logistics and technical support services primarily to navy ship and aviation programs 
under the reorganization plan  the company retained the ship engineering  logistics and technical service businesses under the amsec name the amsec businesses and  in exchange  saic received the aviation  combat systems and strike force integration services businesses from amsec the divested businesses 
this reorganization was treated as a step acquisition for the acquisition of saic s interests in the amsec businesses  with the company recognizing a pre tax gain of million for the effective sale of its interests in the 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation divested businesses 
from the date of this reorganization  the operating results of the amsec businesses  and transaction gain  have been reported on a consolidated basis in the shipbuilding segment

contracts the majority of the company s business is generated from long term government contracts for development  production  and service activities 
government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material  labor and subcontracting costs  and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative costs 
unless otherwise specified in a contract  costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation far and cost accounting standards cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs 
examples of costs incurred by the company and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of the far and cas regulations include  but are not limited to  certain legal costs  lobbying costs  charitable donations  and advertising costs 
the company s long term contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories flexibly priced contracts includes both cost type and fixed price incentive contracts 
cost type contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor s allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit 
cost type 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation 
fixed price incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the contractor s allowable costs  but are subject to a cost share limit which affects profitability 
fixed price incentive contracts effectively become firm fixed price contracts once the cost share limit is reached 
firm fixed price contracts a firm fixed price contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a pre determined  negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor 
time and materials contracts are considered firm fixed price contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 
the following table summarizes revenue recognized by contract type and customer us other percent in millions government customers total of total flexibly priced firm fixed price total contract fees negotiated contract fee structures  for both flexibly priced and fixed price contracts include  but are not limited to fixed fee amounts  cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance  positive award fees  and negative penalty arrangements 
profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements  percentage of completion of the contract  the achievement of performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under incentive and award fee contracts  is finally determined 
positive award fees certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as cost  schedule  quality  and technical performance 
award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of the company s performance against such negotiated criteria 
fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 
award fee contracts are widely used throughout the company s operating segments 
examples of significant long term contracts with substantial negotiated award fee amounts are the kei  f sdd  global hawk engineering and manufacturing development emd  lpd  ddg programs and the majority of satellite contracts 
compliance and monitoring on a regular basis  the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations 
in addition  costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 
critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments revenue recognition overview the majority of the company s business is derived from long term contracts for the construction of facilities  production of goods  and services provided to the federal government  which are accounted for under the provisions of accounting research bulletin no 
accounting for long term construction type contracts  american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and the aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors 
the company classifies contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts 
the company also enters into contracts that are not associated with the federal government  such as contracts to provide certain services to non federal government customers 
the company accounts for those contracts in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation the company considers the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when it determines the proper accounting method for a particular contract 
percentage of completion accounting the company generally recognizes revenues from its long term contracts under the cost to cost and the units of delivery measures of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses 
for most contracts  sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
for certain contracts with large up front purchases of material  primarily in the shipbuilding segment  sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs 
the units of delivery measure is a modification of the percentage of completion method  which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms 
the company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries 
the use of the percentage of completion method depends on the ability of the company to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design  manufacture  and delivery of its products and services 
such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years  and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
sales under cost type contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 
many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product 
these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred 
incentives and award fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 
incentives and award fees that cannot be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 
other changes in estimates of contract sales  costs  and profits are recognized using the cumulative catch up method of accounting 
this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
hence  the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
certain service contracts revenue under contracts to provide services to non federal government customers are generally recognized when services are performed 
service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts  and outsourcing type arrangements  primarily in the information and services business 
revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs incurred under these service contracts are expensed as incurred  except that direct and incremental set up costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement 
operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate from period to period  particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 
service contracts that include more than one type of product or service are accounted for under the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accordingly  for applicable arrangements  revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values 
cost estimation the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company s engineers  program managers  and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance  availability and timing of funding from the 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation customer  and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
contract cost estimates are updated at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances 
cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly 
when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded to cost of sales in the period the loss is determined 
loss provisions are first offset against costs that are included in inventoried assets  with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities 
purchase accounting and goodwill overview the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time  which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
for acquisitions completed through december   adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period typically not exceeding twelve months 
adjustments related to income tax uncertainties  which may have extended beyond the purchase price allocation period  through december   were also recorded to goodwill 
acquisition accruals the company has established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from its acquisitions and divestitures 
these accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures 
the accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and  in most cases  involve a significant degree of judgment 
management has recorded these accruals in accordance with its interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements  known facts  and an estimation of probable future events based on management s experience 
goodwill the company performs impairment tests for goodwill as of november th of each year  or when evidence of potential impairment exists 
when it is determined that impairment has occurred  a charge to operations is recorded 
in order to test for potential impairment  the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis  corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate 
adverse equity market conditions and the resulting decline in current market multiples and the company s stock price as of november   have led to a goodwill impairment charge totaling billion at shipbuilding and space technology 
the company will continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of its goodwill and other long lived assets 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations  weighted average cost of capital wacc  and terminal value assumptions 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry 
the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of the company s recorded goodwill  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company s impairment analysis 
litigation  commitments  and contingencies overview the company is subject to a range of claims  lawsuits  environmental and income tax matters  and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its internal and external legal counsel 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management  after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
environmental accruals the company is subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it conducts operations 
the company records an accrual to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
factors which could result in changes to the company s assessment of probability  range of loss  and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions  increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate  discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated  results of efforts to determine legally responsible parties  changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements  and improvements in remediation technology 
although management cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability accrued  management does not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operation  or cash flows 
litigation accruals litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management  after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
based upon the information available  the company believes that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
uncertain tax positions effective january   the company measures and records uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
only tax positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized in the financial statements 
the timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income taxes 
if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties  the company recognizes an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed in the tax return of the company 
the company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
penalties  if probable and reasonably estimable  are recognized as a component of income tax expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item prior to  the company recorded accruals for tax contingencies and related interest when it determined that it was probable that a liability had been incurred and the amount of the contingency could be reasonably estimated based on specific events such as an audit or inquiry by a taxing authority 
under existing us gaap  prior to january   changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from the resolution of pre acquisition contingencies of acquired businesses were charged or credited to goodwill  effective january   such changes will be recorded to income tax expense 
adjustments to other tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 
retirement benefits overview assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company s pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans are evaluated annually by management in consultation with its outside actuaries 
in the event that the company determines that plan amendments or changes in the assumptions are warranted  future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation assumptions the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rates 
for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable  such as real estate  private equity  and hedge funds  estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available 
discount rate the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the discount rate is generally based on the yield on high quality corporate fixed income investments 
at the end of each year  the discount rate is primarily determined using the results of bond yield curve models based on a portfolio of high quality bonds matching the notional cash inflows with the expected benefit payments for each significant benefit plan 
taking into consideration the factors noted above  the company s weighted average pension composite discount rate was percent at december   and percent at december  holding all other assumptions constant  and since net actuarial gains and losses stayed within the percent accounting corridor as was the case for the expense measurement period  an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate assumption for would have decreased or increased pension and postretirement benefit expense for by approximately million and decreased or increased the amount of the benefit obligation recorded at december   by approximately million 
the effects of hypothetical changes in the discount rate for a single year may not be representative and may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future years because of the application of the accounting corridor 
the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required 
due to adverse capital market conditions the company s pension plan assets experienced a negative return of approximately percent in as a result  substantially all of the company s plans have experienced net actuarial losses outside the percent accounting corridor at the end of  thus requiring accumulated gains and losses to be amortized to expense 
as a result of this condition  sensitivity of net periodic costs to changes in the discount rate will be much higher in the near future than was the case in expected long term rate of return the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested in a specified target asset allocation to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations 
for and  the company assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return assumption for  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase or decrease the company s pension and postretirement benefit expense for by approximately million 
health care cost trend rates the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care inflation  changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns  technological advances  and changes in the health status of the plan participants 
for  the company assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of percent reached in in  the company assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of percent reached in differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on postretirement benefit results percentage percentage in millions point increase point decrease increase decrease from change in health care cost trend rates to postretirement benefit expense postretirement benefit liability

the lhd program achieved several important risk retirement milestones toward its planned delivery date  and as a result million of the first quarter charge was reversed in the second half of cost of service revenues during increased million  or percent  over and increased basis points as a percent of service revenues over the same period due primarily to the sales volume increase described above 
the increase in cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues is primarily due to lower performance in the commercial  state local business area in information technology 
cost of product sales during increased million over while decreasing basis points as a percentage of product sales over the same period 
the increase in cost of product sales is due largely to the sales volume increase described above while the margin rate improvement is primarily driven by improved program performance at aerospace and shipbuilding 
cost of service sales during increased billion  or percent  over while decreasing basis points as a percentage of service sales over the same period 
cost of service revenues in increased over primarily due to higher sales volume at information services 
general and administrative expenses in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts  most general corporate expenses incurred at both the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts 
for most components of the company  these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost 
general and administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales and service revenues decreased from percent in to percent in primarily as a result of costs remaining relatively constant while revenues increased over the same period in general and administrative expenses remained at a constant rate of approximately percent of sales in and goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a non cash charge totaling billion at shipbuilding and space technology for the impairment of goodwill 
in accordance with 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performed its required annual impairment test for goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis supported by comparative market multiples to determine the fair values of its businesses versus their book values 
the test as of november   indicated that the book values for shipbuilding and space technology exceeded the fair values of these businesses 
the impairment charge is primarily driven by adverse equity market conditions that caused a decrease in current market multiples and the company s stock price as of november   compared with the test performed as of november  the charge reduces goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions made in and and does not impact the company s normal business operations 
prior to recording the goodwill impairment charges at shipbuilding and space technology  the company tested the purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets at both of these businesses as required by sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and the carrying value of these assets were determined not to be impaired 
operating loss income the company considers operating income to be an important measure for evaluating its operating performance and  as is typical in the industry  defines operating income as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses 
operating income for the company is further evaluated for each of the business segments in which the company operates 
management of the company internally manages its operations by reference to segment operating income 
segment operating income is defined as operating income before unallocated expenses and net pension adjustment  both of which do not affect the segments  and the reversal of royalty income  which is classified as other income for financial reporting purposes 
segment operating income is one of the key metrics management uses to evaluate operating performance 
segment operating income is not  however  a measure of financial performance under us gaap  and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner

net pension adjustment the net pension adjustment reflects the difference between pension expense determined in accordance with sfas no 
employer s accounting for pensions us gaap pension expense and the pension expense allocated to the operating segments under cas 
the net pension adjustment increased income by million and million in and  respectively  as compared with an expense of million in the income in and was due to decreased us gaap pension expense primarily resulting from better than estimated investment returns and higher discount rate assumptions 
due to adverse capital market conditions the company s pension plan assets experienced a negative return of approximately percent in compared with a long term estimated return of percent

the estimate is based on a discount rate and a long term rate of return of percent 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  or percent  in as compared with the decrease is primarily due to the conversion and redemption of the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in april  which reduced the related dividends paid during the periods which were recorded as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income in part ii  item

these realignments are designed to more fully leverage existing capabilities and enhance development and delivery of products and services 
during the second quarter of  the company transferred certain programs and assets from the missiles business in the mission systems segment to the space technology segment 
in january  the newport news and ship systems businesses were realigned into a single segment called northrop grumman shipbuilding 
previously  these businesses were separate operating segments which were aggregated into a single segment for financial reporting purposes 
in addition  certain electronics businesses were transferred to mission systems during the first quarter of the operating results for all periods presented have been revised to reflect these changes 
see a description of the segment business areas and specific realignments located in part i  item subsequent realignments in january  the company streamlined its organizational structure by reducing the number of reporting segments from seven to five 
the five segments are aerospace systems  which combines the former integrated systems and space technology segments  electronic systems  information systems  which combines the former information technology and mission systems segments  shipbuilding and technical services 
the creation of the aerospace systems and information systems segments strengthens alignment with customers  improves the company s ability to execute on programs and win new business  and enhances cost competitiveness 
this subsequent realignment is not reflected in any of the accompanying financial information 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation key segment financial measures operating performance assessment and reporting the company manages and assesses the performance of its businesses based on its performance on individual contracts and programs obtained generally from government organizations using the financial measures referred to below  with consideration given to the critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments described on page based on this approach and the nature of the company s operations  the discussion of consolidated results of operations generally focuses around the company s seven reporting segments versus distinguishing between products and services 
product sales are predominantly generated in the electronics  integrated systems  space technology and shipbuilding segments  while the majority of the company s service revenues are generated by the information technology  mission systems and technical services segments 
sales and service revenues period to period sales reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts 
changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume 
unless otherwise described  volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues due to varying production activity levels  delivery rates  or service levels on individual contracts 
volume changes will typically carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 
segment operating income segment operating income reflects the performance of segment contracts 
excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance  including the portion of corporate expenses such as management and administration  legal  environmental  certain compensation and other retiree benefits  and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas regulations and the far  and therefore not allocated to the segments 
changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume  as discussed above  or performance 
performance refers to changes in contract margin rates 
these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on a particular contract 
operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded 
operating income may also be affected by  among other things  the effects of workforce stoppages  the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes  resolution of disputed items with the customer  recovery of insurance proceeds  and other discrete events 
at the completion of a long term contract  any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings
