table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes  each included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a global network marketing company that sells weight management products  nutritional supplements  energy  sports fitness products and personal care products 
we pursue our mission of changing people s lives by providing a financially rewarding business opportunity to distributors and quality products to distributors and their customers who seek a healthy lifestyle 
we are one of the largest network marketing companies in the world with net sales of approximately billion for the year ended december  as of december   we sold our products in countries through a network of over million independent distributors except in china  where we sell our products through retail stores and an employed sales force 
we believe the quality of our products and the effectiveness of our distribution network  coupled with geographic expansion  have been the primary reasons for our success throughout our year operating history 
our products are grouped in four principal categories weight management  targeted nutrition  energy  sports fitness and outer nutrition 
our products are often sold in programs that are comprised of a series of related products designed to simplify weight management and nutrition for consumers and maximize our distributors cross selling opportunities 
industry wide factors that affect us and our competitors include the increasing prevalence of obesity and the aging of the worldwide population  which are driving demand for nutrition and wellness related products and the recruitment and retention of distributors 
while we are closely monitoring the current global economic crisis  the company remains focused on the opportunities and challenges in retailing of our products  recruiting and retaining distributors  improving distributor productivity  opening new markets  further penetrating existing markets including china  the us  brazil  mexico and russia  globalizing successful distributor methods of operation such as nutrition clubs  introducing new products  developing niche market segments and further investing in our infrastructure 
in late  we changed our geographic regions from five to six regions 
this updated regional structure allows us to better support the distributor leadership and enhance synergies within each region 
under the new geographic regions  we report revenue from north america  which consists of the us  canada and jamaica  mexico and central america  which consists of mexico  costa rica  el salvador  panama  dominican republic  honduras  nicaragua  and guatemala  south america  which includes brazil  emea  which consists of europe  the middle east and africa  asia pacific  which consists of asia excluding china  new zealand and australia  and china historical information presented in this annual report on form k relating to our geographic regions has been reclassified to conform with our current geographic presentation 
volume points by geographic region a key non financial measure we focus on is volume points on a royalty basis  or volume points  which is essentially our weighted unit measure of product sales volume 
it is a useful measure that we rely on as it excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and ignores the differences generated by varying retail pricing across geographic markets 
the volume point measure  in the aggregate and in each region  can be a measure of our sales 
table of contents volume as well as of sales volume trends 
in general  an increase in volume points in a particular geographic region or country indicates an increase in our sales volume which results in an increase in our local currency net sales and a decrease in volume points in a particular geographic region or country indicates a decrease in our sales volume  which results in decreasing local currency net sales 
for the year ended december  change change volume points in millions north america mexico central america south america emea asia pacific china worldwide number of new sales leaders by geographic region during the reporting period another key non financial measure on which we focus is the number of distributors qualified as new sales leaders under our compensation system 
excluding china  distributors qualify for supervisor status based on their volume points 
the changes in the total number of sales leaders or changes in the productivity of sales leaders may cause volume points to increase or decrease 
the fluctuation in the number of new sales leaders is a general indicator of the level of distributor recruitment 
full year december  change change north america mexico central america south america emea asia pacific excluding china total new supervisors new china sales employees worldwide total new sales leaders number of supervisors and retention rates by geographic region as of re qualification period our compensation system requires each supervisor to re qualify for such status each year  prior to february  in order to maintain their discount on product and be eligible to receive royalty payments 
in february of each year  we demote from the rank of supervisor those distributors who did not satisfy the supervisor re qualification requirements during the preceding twelve months 
the re qualification requirement does not apply to new supervisors ie those who became supervisors subsequent to the january re qualification of the prior year 
supervisor statistics excluding china in thousands january total supervisors january february new supervisors demoted supervisors did not re qualify other supervisors resigned  etc end of february total supervisors 
table of contents the distributor statistics below further highlight the calculation for retention 
supervisor retention excluding china in thousands supervisors needed to re qualify demoted supervisors did not re qualify total re qualified retention rate the table below reflects the number of sales leaders as of february subsequent to the annual re qualification date and supervisor retention rate by year and by region 
number of sales leaders supervisors retention rate north america mexico central america south america emea asia pacific excluding china total supervisors china sales employees worldwide total sales leaders china sales employees represent the cumulative total employed sales force  both active and inactive  operating under our china marketing plan where we sell our products through retail stores 
we will begin an annual re evaluation process commencing in early to determine the ongoing sales employees in china and we anticipate a reduction in this figure following this annual re evaluation process 
the number of supervisors by geographic region as of the quarterly reporting dates will normally be higher than the number of supervisors by geographic region as of the re qualification period because supervisors who do not re qualify during the relevant twelve month period will be dropped from the rank of supervisor the following february 
since supervisors purchase most of our products for resale to other distributors and consumers  comparisons of supervisor totals on a year to year basis are good indicators of our recruitment and retention efforts in different geographic regions 
the value of the average monthly purchase of herbalife products by our sales leaders has remained relatively constant over time 
consequently  increases in our sales are driven primarily by our retention of supervisors and by our recruitment and retention of distributors  rather than through increases in the productivity of our overall supervisor base 
we provide distributors with products  support materials  training  special events and a competitive compensation program 
if a distributor wants to pursue the herbalife business opportunity  the distributor is responsible for growing his or her business and personally pays for the sales activities related to attracting new customers and recruiting distributors by hosting events such as herbalife opportunity meetings or success training seminars  by advertising herbalife s products  by purchasing and using promotional materials such as t shirts  buttons and caps  by utilizing and paying for direct mail and print material such as brochures  flyers  catalogs  business cards  posters and banners and telephone book listings  by purchasing inventory for sale or use as samples  and by training  mentoring and following up in person or via the phone or internet with customers and recruits on how to use herbalife products and or pursue the herbalife business opportunity 

table of contents presentation retail sales represent the gross sales amounts on our invoices to distributors before distributor allowances  as defined below  and net sales  which reflect distribution allowances and handling and freight income  represent what we collect and recognize as net sales in our financial statements 
we discuss retail sales because of its fundamental role in our compensation systems  internal controls and operations  including its role as the basis upon which distributor discounts  royalties and bonuses are awarded 
in addition  it is used as the basis for certain information included in daily and monthly reports reviewed by our management 
however  such a measure is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  or gaap 
you should not consider retail sales in isolation from  nor as a substitute for  net sales and other consolidated income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap  or as a measure of profitability or liquidity 
a reconciliation of net sales to retail sales is presented below under results of operations 
product sales represent the actual product purchase price paid to us by our distributors  after giving effect to distributor discounts referred to as distributor allowances  which approximate of retail sales prices 
distributor allowances as a percentage of retail sales may vary by country depending upon regulatory restrictions that limit or otherwise restrict distributor allowances 
our gross profit consists of net sales less cost of sales  which represents the prices we pay to our raw material suppliers and manufacturers of our products as well as costs related to product shipments  duties and tariffs  freight expenses relating to shipment of products to distributors and importers and similar expenses 
royalty overrides are our most significant expense and consist of royalty overrides and production bonuses which total approximately and  respectively  of the retail sales of weight management  targeted nutrition  energy  sports fitness  outer nutrition and promotional products  the mark hughes bonus payable to some of our most senior distributors in the aggregate amount of up to of retail sales of weight management  targeted nutrition  energy  sports fitness and outer nutrition  and other discretionary incentive cash bonuses to qualifying distributors 
royalty overrides are generally earned based on retail sales and approximate in the aggregate about of retail sales or approximately of our net sales 
royalty overrides together with distributor allowances represent the potential earnings to distributors of up to approximately of retail sales 
the compensation to distributors is generally for the development  retention and improved productivity of their distributor sales organizations and is paid to several levels of distributors on each sale 
due to restrictions on direct selling in china  our full time employed sales representatives in china are compensated with wages  bonuses and benefits instead of the distributor allowances and royalty overrides utilized in our traditional marketing program used in our other five regions 
because of local country regulatory constraints  we may be required to modify our typical distributor incentive plans as described above 
consequently  the total distributor discount percentage may vary over time 
we also offer reduced distributor allowances and pay reduced royalty overrides with respect to certain products worldwide 
our operating margins consist of net sales less cost of sales and royalty overrides 
selling  general and administrative expenses represent our operating expenses  components of which include labor and benefits  sales events  professional fees  travel and entertainment  distributor marketing  occupancy costs  communication costs  bank fees  depreciation and amortization  foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
most of our sales to distributors outside the united states are made in the respective local currencies 
in preparing our financial statements  we translate revenues into us dollars using average exchange rates 
additionally  the majority of our purchases from our suppliers generally are made in us dollars 
consequently  a strengthening of the us dollar versus a foreign currency can have a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margins and can generate transaction losses on intercompany transactions 
throughout the last five years  foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated significantly 
from time to time  we enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk as discussed in further detail in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
table of contents summary financial results net sales for the year ended december  increased to  million from  million in for the year ended december   net sales in many of our top countries including china  us  venezuela  brazil  italy and taiwan increased     and  respectively  as compared to the same period in these increases in net sales were mainly due to the continued success of our various dmo s  such as the nutrition club dmo and its expansion into commercial clubs and central clubs  the wellness coach dmo  the weight loss challenge dmo and the healthy breakfast dmo  as well as distributor momentum from sales extravaganzas held during the year and an increase in the number of new sales leaders compared to the prior year period 
overall  the appreciation of foreign currencies had a million favorable impact on net sales for the year ended december   representing of the total net sales increase of million 
net income for the year ended december  increased to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the same period in the increase was driven by revenue growth in many of our markets and a lower effective tax rate  partially offset by higher labor costs  sales events costs  advertising and promotion expenses and depreciation expense 
net income for the year ended december  included a million unfavorable after tax impact related to restructuring costs and a million valuation allowance on deferred tax asset for deferred interest 
net income for the year ended december  included an unfavorable after tax impact of million from the completion of the first phase and start of the second phase of our realignment for growth plan  an increase in tax reserves of million and a million net tax benefit resulting from various international tax settlements 
results of operations our results of operations for the periods described below are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for future periods  which depend upon numerous factors  including our ability to recruit new distributors and retain existing distributors  open new markets  further penetrate existing markets  introduce new products and programs that will help our distributors increase their retail efforts and develop niche market segments

management s role  both in country and at the corporate level is to provide distributors with a competitive and broad product line  encourage strong teamwork and leadership among the chairman s club and president s team distributors and offer leading edge business tools to make doing business with herbalife simple 
management uses the distributor marketing program coupled with educational and motivational tools and promotions to incentivize distributors to increase recruiting  retention and retailing  which in turn affect net sales 
such tools include company sponsored sales events such as extravaganzas and world team schools where large groups of distributors gather  thus allowing them to network with other distributors  learn recruiting  retention and retailing techniques from our leading distributors and become more familiar with how to market and sell our products and business opportunities 
accordingly  management believes that these development and motivation programs increase the productivity of the supervisor network 
the expenses for such programs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
sales are driven by several factors  including the number and productivity of distributors and sales leaders who continually build  educate and motivate their respective distribution and sales organizations 
we also use event and non event product promotions to motivate distributors to increase recruiting  retention and retailing activities 
these promotions have prizes ranging from qualifying for events to product prizes and vacations 
the costs of these promotions are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the factors described above have helped distributors increase their business  which in turn has driven growth in our business 
the discussion below of net sales by geographic region further details some of the specific causes of the growth of our business as well as describes unique growth factors specific to certain geographic regions or major countries 
we believe that the correct business foundation  coupled with ongoing training and promotional initiatives  is required to increase recruiting and retention of distributors and retailing our products 
the correct business foundation includes strong country management that works closely with the distributor leadership  unified distributor leadership  a broad product line that appeals to local consumer needs  a favorable regulatory environment  a scalable and stable technology platform and an attractive distributor marketing plan 
initiatives  such as success training seminars  world team schools  promotional events and regional extravaganzas are integral components of developing a highly motivated and educated distributor sales organization that will work toward increasing the recruitment and retention of distributors 
our strategy will continue to include creating and maintaining growth within existing markets  while expanding into new markets 
in addition  new ideas and dmos are being generated in our regional markets and globalized where applicable  either by distributors  country management or corporate management 
examples of dmos include the club concept in mexico  the total plan in brazil  the wellness coach in france  and the 
table of contents internet sampling and weight loss challenge in the us management s strategy is to review the applicability of expanding successful country initiatives throughout a region  and where appropriate  financially support the globalization of these initiatives

distributors previously paid vat on purchases of most of our products 
this vat increase impacted approximately of our volume in the mexican market and because the predominant dmo in mexico is retail price sensitive it has caused our volumes to decline 
we are in the process of challenging this assessment on several fronts  however in the near term while the products continue to be subject to vat  we expect volume growth to be constrained

gross profit gross profit was  million for the year ended december   as compared to  million in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit for the year ended december  increased slightly to as compared to for the same period in the increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to country mix and foreign exchange fluctuations 
generally  gross profit percentages do not vary significantly as a percentage of net sales 
we are experiencing ingredient and product price pressure in the areas of soy  dairy products  plastics  and transportation reflecting current global economic trends 
we believe that we have the ability to mitigate some of these cost increases through improved optimization of our supply chain coupled with select increases in the retail prices of our products 
royalty overrides royalty overrides as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended december   as compared to in the same period in the decrease for the year ended december  was primarily due to the increase in net sales in china where compensation to our full time employee sales representatives is included in selling  general and administrative expenses as opposed to royalty overrides where it is included for all other distributors under our worldwide marking plan 
generally  this ratio varies slightly from period to period due to changes in the mix of products and countries because full royalty overrides are not paid on certain products and in certain countries

these increases were partially offset by lower foreign currency exchange losses of million as compared to we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars over levels reflecting higher china sales employee costs  increased depreciation  primarily related to our global oracle implementation  and various sales growth initiatives  including distributor promotions 
as a result of these factors  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is expected to be above levels

net interest expense net interest expense is as follows year ended year ended december  december  net interest expense dollars in millions interest expense interest income total net interest expense the increase in interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to the higher average balance of long term borrowings  partially offset by lower interest rates  in as compared to see liquidity and capital resources in this section for further discussion on our senior secured credit facility

liquidity and capital resources we have historically met our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  including funding for expansion of operations  through net cash flows provided by operating activities 
our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flows 
variations in sales of our products would directly affect the availability of funds 
there are no material restrictions on the ability to transfer and remit funds among our international affiliated companies 
we are closely monitoring various aspects of the current worldwide financial crisis and we do not believe that there has been or will be a material impact on our liquidity from this crisis 
as noted above  we have historically met our funding needs utilizing cash flow from operating activities and we believe we will have sufficient resources to meet debt service obligations in a timely manner 
our existing debt has primarily resulted from our share repurchase activities and not from the need to fund our normal operations  therefore limiting the impact that the current worldwide credit crisis has on us 
while a significant net sales decline could potentially affect the availability of funds  many of our largest expenses are purely variable in nature  which could protect our funding in all but a dramatic net sales downturn 
further we maintain a revolving credit facility which had million of undrawn capacity as of december  and is comprised of banks who are continuing to support the facility through the recent worldwide financial crisis

the majority of our purchases from suppliers are generally made in us dollars  while sales to our distributors generally are made in local currencies

the company regularly reviews all pending litigation matters in which it is involved and establishes reserves deemed appropriate by management for these litigation matters when a probable loss estimate can be made 
as a marketer of dietary and nutritional supplements and other products that are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies  the company has been and is currently subjected to various product liability claims 
the effects of these claims to date have not been material to the company  and the reasonably possible range of exposure on currently existing claims is not material to the company 
the company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the allegations contained in the lawsuits 
the company currently maintains product liability insurance with an annual deductible of million 
certain of the company s subsidiaries have been subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in their respective countries 
in certain of these tax audits  governmental authorities are proposing that significant amounts of additional taxes and related interest and penalties are due 
the company and its tax advisors believe that there are substantial defenses to their allegations that additional taxes are owed  and the company is vigorously contesting the additional proposed taxes and related charges 
these matters may take several years to resolve  and the company cannot be sure of their ultimate resolution 
however  it is the opinion of management that adverse outcomes  if any  will not likely result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
this opinion is based on the belief that any losses suffered in excess of amounts reserved would not be material  and that the company has meritorious defenses 
although the company has reserved an amount that the company believes represents the most likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes  if the company is incorrect in the assessment the company may have to record additional expenses 

table of contents subsequent event on february   the company s board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of per common share  for the fourth quarter  to shareholders of record effective march   payable on march  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we are a network marketing company that sells a wide range of weight management products  nutritional supplements  energy  sports fitness products and personal care products within one industry segment as defined under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or sfas our products are manufactured by third party providers and then sold to independent distributors who sell herbalife products to retail consumers or other distributors 
we sell products in countries throughout the world and we are organized and managed by geographic region 
we have elected to aggregate our operating segments into one reporting segment  except china  as management believes that our operating segments have similar operating characteristics and similar long term operating performance 
in making this determination  management believes that the operating segments are similar in the nature of the products sold  the product acquisition process  the types of customers products are sold to  the methods used to distribute the products  and the nature of the regulatory environment 
revenue is recognized when products are shipped and title passes to the independent distributor or importer or as products are sold in our retail stores in china 
amounts billed for freight and handling costs are included in net sales 
we generally receive the net sales price in cash or through credit card payments at the point of sale 
related royalty overrides and allowances for product returns are recorded when the merchandise is shipped 
allowances for product returns  primarily in connection with our buyback program  are provided at the time the product is shipped 
this accrual is based upon historic return rates for each country and the relevant return pattern  which reflects anticipated returns to be received over a period of up to months following the original sale 
historically  product returns and buybacks have not been significant 
product returns and buybacks were approximately of retail sales for the year ended december  and approximately of retail sales for the years ended december  and we record reserves against our inventory to provide for estimated obsolete or unsalable inventory based on assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than management s assumptions  additional reserves could be required 
likewise  favorable future demand and market conditions could positively impact future operating results if previously reserved for inventory is sold 
we reserved for obsolete and slow moving inventory totaling million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 

table of contents goodwill and other intangibles not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps 
first  we determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill and other intangibles over the implied fair value 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  or sfas the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and other intangibles 
as of december  and december  we had goodwill of approximately million and million  respectively  and marketing franchise of million as of both dates 
no marketing related intangibles or goodwill impairment was recorded during the twelve months ended december  contingencies are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  or sfas sfas requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use judgment 
many of these legal and tax contingencies can take years to be resolved 
generally  as the time period increases over which the uncertainties are resolved  the likelihood of changes to the estimate of the ultimate outcome increases 
deferred income tax assets have been established for net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries and have been reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect them at amounts estimated to be ultimately realized 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts over a future period of time 
realization of the income tax carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the net carrying value of the income tax carryforwards will be realized 
the amount of the income tax carryforwards that is considered realizable  however  could change if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are adjusted 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility and employee stock award exercise behaviors 
our expected volatility is primarily based upon the historical volatility of our common shares and  due to the limited period of public trading data for our common shares  it is also validated against the volatility of a company peer group 
the expected life of awards is based on the simple average of the average vesting period and the life of the award 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the statements of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation number  income taxes  or fin fin addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  except as it applies to the nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities subject to fsp no 
sfas clarifies the definition of fair value  prescribes methods for measuring fair value  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
as discussed in note

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas  or fsp fas fsp fas will delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
fsp fas partially defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of fsp we believe the adoption of fas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas r  which replaces sfas sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
sfas r also modifies the recognition for preacquisition contingencies  such as environmental or legal issues  restructuring plans and acquired research and development value in purchase accounting 
sfas r amends sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to require the acquirer to recognize changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable because of a business combination either in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination or directly in contributed capital  depending on the circumstances 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe the adoption of sfas r will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which arise during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
on a selected basis  we use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge these risks 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to written guidelines and procedures 
we have adopted sfas sfas  as amended and interpreted  established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the underlying hedged item are recognized concurrently in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income  or oci  and are recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings 
sfas defines the requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships as well as ongoing effectiveness assessments in order to use hedge accounting 
for a derivative that does not qualify as a hedge  changes in fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings 
a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and derivatives is presented below 

table of contents foreign exchange risk we enter into foreign exchange derivatives in the ordinary course of business primarily to reduce exposure to currency fluctuations attributable to intercompany transactions  translation of local currency revenue  inventory purchases subject to foreign currency exposure  and to partially mitigate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
with the exception of the million foreign exchange forward contracts relating to forecasted inventory purchases  all of our foreign exchange contracts are designated as free standing derivatives for which hedge accounting does not apply 
the changes in the fair market value of the derivatives not qualifying as cash flow hedges are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
the foreign exchange forward contracts are used to hedge advances between subsidiaries and to partially mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
foreign exchange average rate option contracts are also used to mitigate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of foreign currency movements on the operating results of our subsidiaries 
the fair value of forward and option contracts is based on third party bank quotes 
during the year ended december   we purchased million of forward contracts in order to hedge forecasted inventory purchases that are designated as cash flow hedges and are subject to foreign currency exposures 
we have elected to apply the hedge accounting rules as required by sfas  for these hedges 
these contracts allow us to sell euros in exchange for us dollars at specified contract rates 
as of december   approximately million of the contracts were outstanding and are expected to mature over the next year 
our derivative financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value based on quoted market rates 
these forward contracts are used to hedge forecasted inventory purchases over specific months 
changes in the fair value of forward contracts  excluding forward points  designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings within stockholders equity  and are recognized in cost of goods sold in the period which approximates the time the hedged inventory is sold 
as of december  we recorded a liability at fair value of million with the offsetting amounts recorded in other comprehensive income
