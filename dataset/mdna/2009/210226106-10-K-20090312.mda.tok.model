item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operations overview we are primarily engaged in real estate land sales and development  reinvestment of land sales proceeds into income properties  and golf course operations 
we own approximately  acres in florida  of which approximately  are located within and form a substantial portion of the western boundary of the city of daytona beach 
our lands are well located in the central florida interstate corridor  providing an excellent opportunity for reasonably stable land sales in future years 
with our substantial land holdings in daytona beach  we have parcels available for the entire spectrum of real estate uses 
along with land sales  we selectively develop parcels primarily for commercial uses 
although pricing levels and changes by us and our immediate competitors can affect sales  we generally enjoy a competitive edge due to low costs associated with long time land ownership and a significant ownership position in the immediate market 
as a general policy we do not discount sales prices to accelerate land sales 
until the dramatic downturn in the national and local economies in  sales activity on company owned lands had been strong over the last several years 
development activities on and around company owned lands continued relatively strong throughout with the commencement and completion of projects planned or in process before the downturn 
during  the we sold approximately acres of land consisting of upland acres and wetland acres in two sales transactions 
sales and development activities over the last several years included the sale of acres of land to florida hospital for the construction of a new hospital  which is anticipated to open mid year  the expansion of the daytona beach auto mall  the opening of a second office building in the cornerstone office park  continued development within the acre gateway commerce park where a  square foot industrial building was completed in early and the acre interstate commerce park  both adjacent to interstate  and the sale of approximately acres of land west of interstate on which a private high school was constructed and opened in august in early the city of daytona beach police headquarters  located adjacent to gateway commerce park  was completed and occupied 
in the first half of  development also commenced on a unit apartment complex  a medical office building  and a townhouse residential community on the east side of interstate on the west side of the interstate  development has commenced on a fire station  a hotel  an elementary school  and a  square foot furniture retail store in the interstate commerce park 
these commercial and residential development activities tend to create additional buyer interest and sales opportunities  although  the weak economic conditions have led us to enter with a generally small backlog of contracts 
in  we initiated a strategy of investing in income properties utilizing the proceeds of agricultural land sales qualifying for income tax deferral through like kind exchange treatment for tax purposes 
by the end of  we had invested approximately million in twenty six income properties through this process 
this investment includes the april purchase of a harris teeter supermarket in charlotte  north carolina  for approximately million 
with this investment base in income properties  lease revenue of approximately million is projected to be generated annually 
this income  along with income from additional net lease income property investments  will decrease earnings volatility in future years and add to overall financial performance 
this has enabled us to enter into the business of building  leasing  and holding in our portfolio select income properties that are strategically located on our lands 
we currently have two self developed projects in process 
the first project is a two building  square foot flex office space complex located within gateway commerce park 
construction of these buildings was completed in the third quarter of leases are currently in negotiation on this project 
also under development is a acre  lot commercial complex  located at the corner of lpga and williamson boulevards in daytona 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued beach  florida 
site work  building plans  and permitting are complete for this project 
the parcel will include a  square foot class a office building 
construction of the building began in july with the execution of a lease with merrill lynch for a significant portion of the building 
a lease is currently in negotiation for substantial additional space in the building 
golf operations consist of the operation of two golf courses  a clubhouse facility  and food and beverage activities within the lpga international mixed use residential community on the west side of interstate  south and east of lpga boulevard 
the champions course was designed by rees jones and the legends course was designed by arthur hills 
prior to  golf operations revenues had grown despite an overall decline in golf course revenues in florida 
the florida golf industry has been hurt by over building of golf courses and hurricane activity in past years 
during  we made changes in management within the golf operation looking for improved operating results for the future 
the overall weak national and local economies led to continued losses in we believe that improvement in golf course operations will be a function of stronger economic conditions  increased tourist demand  a reduction in new golf course construction which has been experienced in the last several years  and most importantly  increased residential growth in lpga international and adjoining land to the west and northwest 
lpga international and nearby projects currently under development are planned to contain about  additional dwelling units 
our efforts to improve revenues and profitability have focused on providing quality products and services while maintaining consistent and stringent cost control for both golf course and food service activities 
our agricultural operations consist of growing  managing  and selling timber and hay on approximately  acres of land on the west side of daytona beach  florida 
we are currently in the process of converting a significant portion of its timberlands to hay production 
summary of operating results for the year ended december   profits of  were earned  equivalent to per share 
these profits represented a decrease from calendar year profits totaling  equivalent to per share 
the downturn was primarily attributed to lower profits from commercial land sales and increased losses from golf operations 
earnings from income properties partially offset these declines with a increase in earnings resulting from the harris teeter property acquired in april general and administrative expenses declined in compared to primarily as a result of the net change in stock option expenses resulting from a decrease in the price of our stock in and an increase in stock price during we also use earnings before depreciation  amortization  and deferred taxes ebddt as a performance measure

we believe  however  that ebddt provides relevant information about operations and is useful  along with net income  for an understanding of our operating results 
ebddt totaled  for the year ended december  this ebddt represented a decrease from ebddt of  posted for the fiscal year 
the downturn was the result of the lower net income coupled with a reduction in the add back for deferred taxes on the reduced real estate sales volume and the associated deferred tax gains

revenues totaled  in and  in partially offsetting the lower revenue was a drop in costs and expenses  with costs and expenses totaling  in and  in the prior year

the downturn is not only the result of lower net income  but also a reduction in the add back for deferred taxes 
the add back for deferred taxes declined as some gains from real estate transactions were not deferred for tax purposes  as they did not meet the criteria established by the tax code  or we were unable to identify properties which met our reinvestment criteria

lower stock option expenses  due to our lower stock price  accounted for this decline 
offsetting the decrease in stock option expense were higher legal fees  primarily associated with securities and exchange commission compliance  and pension and other post retirement benefit costs 
the effective income tax rate approximated in and in calendar year both rates were somewhat lower than our typical effective income tax rate approximating 
the lower tax rates are associated with the utilization and or the release of valuation allowances associated with charitable contributions 
charitable contributions of land to qualified organizations were made in and as we have reasonable assurance that we will generate taxable income to utilize a portion of these income tax deductions over the five year carryforward period  the contributions result in positive adjustments to the income tax provision for both periods 
a valuation allowance has been established for the portion of the deductions we project we will not be able to utilize 
liquidity and capital resources cash  restricted cash  and investment securities totaled  at december   a decrease of  from the  balance held at year end these funds were primarily used for development and construction activities  the continued conversion of our timber lands to hay  and the payment of dividends and income taxes  in addition to the approximate  purchase of the harris teeter income property in charlotte  north carolina 
construction and development activities  which approximated  during the year  included the construction of two roads on our core lands adjacent to lpga boulevard  completion of the  square foot flex office space complex in gateway commerce center  and the commencement of construction on the  square foot class a office building

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued at the end of  the company focused its efforts on obtaining federal stimulus dollars to extend dunn avenue  a major east west thoroughfare bridging interstate  and provide improved access to company lands 
subsequent to year end  the company reached a conceptual agreement with the city of daytona beach and the county of volusia on a cost sharing agreement that will allow the use of federal funds to build this road project 
this cost sharing agreement will reduce capital expenditures that the company  as well as the city of daytona beach and the county of volusia  might have otherwise been required to make to construct dunn ave 
capital to fund the planned expenditures in is expected to be provided from cash and investment securities as they mature  operating activities  and financing sources that are currently in place  including the million revolving line of credit 
we also believe that we have the ability to borrow on a non recourse basis against our existing income properties  which are all free of debt as of the date of this filing 
as additional funds become available through qualified sales  we expect to invest in additional real estate opportunities 
during the fourth quarter of  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of up to  the authorization permits us to effect the repurchases from time to time through a variety of methods including open market repurchases and privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchase plan will be funded through reduced dividend payments in the future  and we have no plans to increase debt to fund the repurchase plan 
through march    shares had been repurchased at a total cost of  our board of directors and management continually review the allocation of any excess capital with the goal of providing the highest return for all shareholders over the long term 
the reviews consider various alternatives  including increasing or decreasing regular dividends  declaring special dividends  repurchasing stock  and retaining funds for reinvestment  including road development and hay conversion of timber lands 
the board of directors has reaffirmed its support for the continuation of the tax deferred exchange strategy for investment of agricultural land sales proceeds  self development of income properties  and development of infrastructure on company owned lands

 accounting for sales of real estate sfas no 

we recognize revenue from the sale of real estate at the time the sale is consummated unless the property is sold on a deferred payment plan and the initial payment does not meet criteria established under sfas no 
 or we retain continuing involvement with the property 
a majority of our land sales contracts contain an anti speculation clause 
this clause requires the buyer to begin construction of their project within a specified period of time 
if this requirement is not met  we have the right  but not the obligation  to repurchase the property at its original sales price 
all transactions closed in and met the criteria established by sfas no 
 and no income was deferred from the transactions at december  during  we closed two transactions for which we had post closing obligations to provide off site utilities and or road improvements 
full cash payment was received at closing  and warranty deeds were transferred and recorded 
the sales contracts do not provide any offsets  rescission  or buy back if the improvements are not made 
on one of the transactions  all of the obligated improvements were completed prior to december   and no revenues or profits were deferred as of that date

upon acquisition  the portion of the purchase price  which represents the market value associated with the lease  is allocated to an intangible asset 
the amount of the intangible asset represents the cost of replacing the tenant should the lease be discontinued 
factors such as vacancy period  tenant improvements  and lease commissions  among others  are considered in calculating the intangible asset 
the intangible asset is amortized over the remaining life of the lease at the time of acquisition

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we have reviewed the recoverability of long lived assets  including real estate development  income properties  and other property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may or may not be recoverable 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment by using an undiscounted cash flow approach which considers future estimated capital expenditures 
impairment on long lived assets is measured at fair value by estimating discounted future operating cash flow and sales price  less cost to sell 
there has been no impairment of long lived assets reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
at the time our debt was refinanced in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
this swap arrangement changes the variable rate cash flow exposure on the debt obligations to fixed cash flows so that we can manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk

the accounting requires the derivative to be recognized on the balance sheet at its fair value and the changes in fair value to be accounted for as other comprehensive income or loss 
we measure the ineffectiveness of the interest rate swap derivative by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the variable leg of the swap with the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future interest cash flows on the floating rate liability 
this measure resulted in no ineffectiveness for the three years ended december  a liability in the amount of  and  at december  and  respectively  has been established on our balance sheet

the current plan was approved at the april  shareholders meeting 
under the plan  the option exercise price equals the stock market price on the date of grant 
the options generally vest over five years and all expire after ten years 
the plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options  which satisfy the requirements of internal revenue code irc section  and non qualified options  which are not entitled to favorable tax treatment under irc section no optionee may exercise incentive stock options in any calendar year for shares of common stock having a total market value of more than  on the date of grant subject to certain carryover provisions 
in connection with the grant of non qualified options  a stock appreciation right for each share covered by the option may also be granted 
the stock appreciation right will entitle the optionee to receive a supplemental payment  which may be paid in whole or in part in cash or in shares of common stock equal to a portion of the spread between the exercise price and the fair market value of the underlying shares at the time of exercise
