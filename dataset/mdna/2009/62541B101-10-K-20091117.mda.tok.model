item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with the financial statements  related notes and other financial information included in this annual report 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we are a global provider of high quality  technologically advanced flexible printed circuits and value added component assembly solutions to the electronics industry 
we believe that we are one of a limited number of manufacturers that provide a seamless  integrated flexible printed circuit and assembly solution from design and application engineering and prototyping through high volume fabrication  component assembly and testing 
we target our solutions within the electronics market and  in particular  we focus on applications where flexible printed circuits facilitate human interaction with an electronic device and are the enabling technology in achieving a desired size  shape  weight or functionality of the device 
current applications for our products include feature phones  smart phones  consumer electronic devices  portable bar code scanners  computer storage devices and medical devices 
we provide our solutions to original equipment manufacturers oems  who produce devices such as feature phones and smart phones and to electronic manufacturing services ems providers  whom typically perform the final assembly of such devices 
our business model  and the way we approach the markets which we serve  is based on value added engineering and providing technology solutions to our customers facilitating the miniaturization of portable electronics 
through early supplier involvement with customers  we look to assist in the development of new designs and processes for the manufacturing of their products and  through value added component assembly of components on flex  seek to provide a higher level of product within their supply chain structure 
this approach is relatively unique and serves to help differentiate us from other traditional contract manufacturers  however  it may or may not always fit with the operating practices of all oems 
our ability to add to our customer base may have a direct impact on the relative percentage of each customer s revenue to total revenues during any reporting period 
we typically have numerous programs in production at any particular time 
the programs prices are subject to intense negotiation and are determined on a program by program basis  dependent on a wide variety of factors  including without limitation  expected volumes  assumed yields  material costs  actual yields  and the amount of third party components within the program 
our profitability is dependent upon how we perform against our targets and the assumptions on which we base our prices for each particular program 
our volumes  margins and yields also vary from program to program and  given various factors and assumptions on which we base our prices  are not necessarily indicative of our profitability 
in fact  some lower priced programs have higher margins while other higher priced programs have lower margins 
given that the programs in production vary from period to period and the pricing and margins between programs vary widely  volumes are not necessarily indicative of our performance 
for example  we could experience an increase in volumes for a particular program during a particular period  but depending on that program s margins and yields and the other programs in production during that period  those higher volumes may or may not result in an increase in overall profitability 
from our inception in until  we were engaged primarily in the manufacturing of flexible printed circuits for military and aerospace applications 
in early  we began to develop the concept of attaching components on flexible printed circuits for motorola 
through these early efforts  we developed the concept of the value added approach with respect to integrating our design engineering expertise with our component assembly capabilities 
this strategy has enabled us to capitalize on two trends over the course of the s  the outsourcing by oems of their manufacturing needs and the shift of manufacturing facilities outside of the united states 
in  we formed mfc  a wholly owned chinese subsidiary to better serve customers that have production facilities in asia and provide a cost effective  high volume production platform for the manufacture of our products 
mfc provides a complete range of capabilities and services to support our global customer base  including design engineering and high volume production of single sided  double sided and multi layer 
table of contents flexible printed circuits and component assemblies 
in fiscal  we formed mfc  a second wholly owned subsidiary in china to further expand our flexible printed circuit manufacturing and assembly capacity 
in fiscal  we leased a manufacturing facility in pontian  malaysia for flexible printed circuit manufacturing and assembly capacity and to broaden our geographic base 
in addition  in fiscal  we leased office space in singapore for our asia pacific regional office 
in fiscal  we acquired the assets of applied optics  inc  a company which designed and manufactured optical and photonic imaging solutions  and operate this business as aurora optical 
in july  we began implementing a plan to close the tucson  arizona facility of aurora optical to consolidate the research and development and other design activities into our corporate headquarters in anaheim  california  and to complete the transfer of the subsidiary s product manufacturing activities to our china subsidiary 
the closure was completed during the fourth fiscal quarter of and we sold or disposed of certain of the related assets  which consisted mainly of company owned manufacturing equipment  before the end of the expected useful life 
we are currently in the process of selling the company owned building 
in addition  we transferred certain pieces of manufacturing equipment  which could be modified to other uses  to our anaheim facility at carrying value 
based on aforementioned closure of the facility  we completed an impairment analysis under the relevant financial accounting standards board fasb authoritative guidance related to long lived assets  and determined that certain of the assets were impaired  and recorded a pre tax charge of million during the fourth quarter of additionally  under the authoritative guidance for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  a pre tax restructuring charge composed of severance  relocation  and other costs related to the closure was estimated at million  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  with the remaining million recorded as incurred during the first quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we acquired pelikon  which develops printed segmented electroluminescent display and smartink and morphpad technologies primarily for use in smart phones  with the potential for future application to other electronic devices 
net sales we design and manufacture our products to customer specifications 
as of september   we engaged the services of ten non exclusive sales representatives to provide customer contacts and market our products directly to our global customer base 
six of these sales representatives were located throughout the united states  three of these sales representatives were located throughout korea  and we also had one sales representative in china 
the variety of products our customers manufacture are referred to as programs 
the majority of our sales are made to customers outside of the united states 
sales volumes may be impacted by customer program and product mix changes and delivery schedule changes imposed on us by our customers 
all sales from our anaheim  california facility and sales from our uk facilities are denominated in us dollars 
all sales from our china facilities are denominated in us dollars for sales outside china or rmb for sales made in china 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of four major categories material  overhead  labor and purchased process services 
material cost relates primarily to the purchase of copper foil  polyimide substrates and electronic components 
overhead costs include all materials and facilities associated with manufacturing support  processing supplies and expenses  support personnel costs  stock based compensation expense related to such personnel  utilities  amortization of facilities and equipment and other related costs 
labor cost represents the cost of personnel related to the manufacture of the completed product 
purchased process services relate to the subcontracting of specific manufacturing processes to outside contractors 
cost of sales may be impacted by capacity utilization  manufacturing yields  product mix and production efficiencies 
also  we may be subject to increased costs as a result of changing material prices because we do not have long term fixed supply agreements 

table of contents research and development research and development costs are incurred in the development of new products and processes  including significant improvements and refinements to existing products and are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense includes commissions paid to sales representatives  personnel related costs associated with sales and marketing  business development and engineering support groups and expenses for overseas sales support  trade show and promotional and marketing brochures 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and benefits of administrative  finance  human resources  regulatory  information services and executive personnel and other expenses related to external accounting  legal and professional expenses  business insurance  management information systems  stock based compensation  travel and entertainment and other corporate office expenses 
impairment and restructuring expense asset impairment expense is the difference between the fair market value  based on the estimated future cash flows of the underlying assets  and the carrying value  or net book value  of the assets 
impairment occurs when the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the underlying assets 
restructuring expense represents severance  relocation  and other costs related to the closure or disposal of a business unit or location 
interest income interest income consists of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents balances and short term investments 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest expense incurred on our long term debt  unused line fees on our revolving facility and interest related to our deferred financing costs 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  consists primarily of the gain or loss on our auction rate securities investments and the gain or loss on foreign currency exchange 
provision for income taxes we record a provision for income taxes based on the statutory rates applicable in the countries in which we do business  subject to any tax holiday periods granted by the respective governmental authorities 
we account for income taxes under the fasb authoritative guidance which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  income taxes  accounts receivable allowances and warranty 
we base our estimates on historical experience  performance metrics and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenues  which we refer to as net sales  are generated from the sale of flexible printed circuit boards and assemblies  which are sold to oems  subcontractors and ems providers to be included in other electronic products 
an ems provider may or may not be an oem subcontractor 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer that includes a fixed or determinable sales price  when title and risk of loss transfers  when delivery of the product has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sale and collectability of the related account receivable is reasonably assured 
our remaining obligation to customers after delivery is limited to our warranty obligations on our product 
we report revenues net of an allowance for returns  refunds and credits  which we estimate based on historical experience 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review our inventory and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage and our estimate of expected and future product demand 
our estimates of future product demand will differ from actual demand  therefore  our estimates of the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may change  which we will record in the period such determination is made 
investments 
the company s investments consist primarily of auction rate securities backed by student loans 
we utilize a discounted cash flow method to determine the related fair value of our investments on a recurring basis 
market variables utilized in developing the valuation model for these securities include relative yields on federal student loan securities  average day t bill rates  day libor rates  interest rate spreads as determined by the changing credit market environment and the quality of market credit and liquidity 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in the credit quality of the securities  changes in liquidity as a result of normal market mechanisms or issuer calls of the securities  and the effects of changes in interest rates 
income taxes 
we determine if our deferred tax assets and liabilities are realizable on an ongoing basis by assessing our need for a valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  as necessary 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we have considered taxable income in prior carry back years  expected future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred tax assets for which we previously provided a valuation allowance  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance 
conversely  if we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would be charged to our results of operations in the period such conclusion was reached 
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been made for such issues  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such issues could be significantly different than originally estimated 

table of contents accounts receivable allowance 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and their credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience  our anticipation of uncollectible amounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses historically have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  we may not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
the majority of our receivables are concentrated in relatively few customers  therefore  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to collect our accounts receivable and require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
warranty reserves 
our warranty periods range from two to thirty six months  depending on the related product 
we provide a warranty reserve for estimated product warranty costs at the time the net sales are recognized 
while we engage in quality programs and processes  up to and including the final product  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the cost of the failed product and the inbound and outbound freight costs incurred in replacing defective parts 
we continuously monitor and analyze product returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related warranty costs based on historical experience and assumptions 
if actual failure rates and the resulting cost of replacement vary from our historically based estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required 
long lived asset impairment 
we test for impairment whenever circumstances or events may affect the recoverability of long lived assets 
the evaluation is primarily dependent on the estimated future cash flows of the assets and the fair value of these items  as determined by management based on a number of estimates  including future cash flow projections  discount rates and terminal values 
in determining these estimates  management considered internally generated information and information obtained from discussions with market participants 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
the impairment test for long lived assets is a two step process 
the first step is to assess if events or changes in circumstances have affected the recoverability of long lived assets 
if management believes that recoverability has been affected  then step two requires management to calculate the undiscounted future cash flow related to the asset or asset group and to compare the cash flow to the carrying value of the asset or asset group 
if undiscounted future cash flows exceed the carrying value  there is no impairment 
restructuring charges 
we recognize restructuring charges related to plans to close or consolidate duplicate manufacturing and administrative facilities 
in connection with these activities  we record restructuring charges for employee termination and relocation costs and other exit related costs 
the recognition of restructuring charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity 
to the extent that actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions  we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities  requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized 
such changes to previously estimated amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans 
in conjunction with the planned closure of aurora optical  we estimated the restructuring costs that would result from the closure 
those costs include  but are not limited to  a termination benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a benefit arrangement that  in substance  is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract  b costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease  and c costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
based on our analysis  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge composed of severance  relocation  and other costs related to the closure of aurora optical in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and recorded a similar charge in the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents goodwill 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to i a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  ii unanticipated competition  or iii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in performing the impairment review  we determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
a component of an operating segment is deemed a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
to evaluate whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of expected future cash flows for that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
to date  we have had no impairments of goodwill 
stock based compensation 
we recognize compensation expense related to stock options granted to employees based on the grant date fair value 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of the stock options granted is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
we utilize the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted 
generally  our calculation of the fair value for options granted under the revised guidance is similar to the calculation of fair value under the original guidance with the exception of the treatment of forfeitures 
expected forfeitures of stock options are estimated based on the historical turnover of our employees 
the fair value of restricted stock units granted is based on the grant date price of our common stock 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
this model also requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including a the expected volatility of our common stock price  which we determine based on historical volatility of our common stock since the date of our initial public offering ipo  b expected dividends  which are zero  as we do not currently anticipate issuing dividends  c expected life of the stock option  which is estimated based on the historical stock option exercise behavior of our employees  and d risk free interest rate is based on observed interest rates zero coupon us treasury debt securities appropriate for the expected holding period 
in the future  we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes valuation model or a different valuation model  which could result in a significantly different impact on our net income or loss 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our statement of income data  expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
year ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing expense general and administrative expense impairment and restructuring costs terminated acquisition expenses operating income loss interest income  net other expense income  net income before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income year ended september  compared to year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased million to million in fiscal versus million in fiscal driven primarily by an increase in average unit sales prices resulting from added material content  partially offset by reduced unit volume shipments 
sales into the consumer electronics sector were million in fiscal versus million in fiscal the increase in sales into the consumer electronics sector was driven primarily by increases in unit volume shipments to one of our key customers related to several programs that were started in the current and prior fiscal year 
shipments into the consumer electronics sector accounted for approximately and of total net sales for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
net sales into the wireless sector decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the decrease of million  or  versus fiscal was primarily due to reduced unit volume shipments to two of our major customers as a result of reduced demand  partially offset by an increase in sales to another major customer 
in fiscal and  the wireless sector was comprised of both smart phones and feature phones  which accounted for approximately and  and and of total sales into the wireless sector  respectively 
sales into the wireless sector comprised approximately and of total net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales of was primarily attributable to the increase of average material content from new programs in the current fiscal year  partially offset by cost reductions from improved manufacturing yields resulting from operational improvement initiatives 
as a result  gross profit decreased to million in the year ended september  versus million in the prior year  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to for fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
we expect quarterly gross margins to be in the to range in early fiscal based on our anticipated product mix and the leveraging of our manufacturing cost structure 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expense increased to million in fiscal  from million in the comparable period of the prior year  an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of million resulting from headcount and salary increases related to our increased emphasis on expanding our research and development activities in anaheim and at pelikon  increased depreciation of million  increased purchased materials of million related to research and development activities  million for increased information technology and human resource support expenses due to expanded activities  and million of other research and development expenses 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased by million to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase is primarily attributable to a compensation and benefits expense increase of million as a result of headcount growth to expand our customer base and geographic coverage  million for information technology and human resource support expenses to support expanded infrastructure  million related to travel expenses  and a net increase of million from other sales and marketing expenses 
these increases were partially offset by reduced commissions expenses of million due to a change in customer mix and a new negotiated sales commission structure 
as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expense increased to versus in the prior year 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased by million to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million for information technology and human resource expenses  as activities were shifted to support expanded manufacturing operations and infrastructure growth coupled with a net decrease of other general and administrative expenses of million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in hardware purchases and software amortization expense of million mainly to support our expanding infrastructure in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expense decreased to of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal  attributable to the favorable leveraging impact on our operating expenses from the increased net sales 
we expect general and administrative expense  as a percentage of net sales  to remain relatively flat during the upcoming fiscal year 
impairment and restructuring cost 
during fiscal  we recorded a net restructuring charge of million which consisted of million related to the restructuring of our wholly owned subsidiary  aurora optical  in tucson  arizona  offset by a gain of million related to the sale of equipment 
impairment and restructuring costs decreased million  or  when compared to fiscal interest income 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a significant decline in interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense is primarily related to interest accrued against the notes payable issued as part of our acquisition of pelikon and unused line fees on our bank loan facilities 
other expense income  net 
other expense income  net decreased to an expense of million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the reduced expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in net losses from foreign exchange due to the movement of the us dollar versus the rmb and other foreign currencies 
in addition  other expense includes million of impairment associated with the decline in value of our arss during fiscal although we have entered into a settlement with ubs that will enable us to redeem these instruments at par value in fiscal  due to a change in us gaap the redemption is not expected to result in a future gain on sale in the statement of income 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was versus for fiscal the tax rate declined primarily as a result of the international reorganization efforts and the transition of technology to further strengthen our asian operations 
in addition  we recognized discrete tax benefits of million due to the expiration of a statute of limitation related to an international tax position and million due to re measurement of a liability associated with an international tax position 
we also recognized a discrete tax 
table of contents expense during fiscal of million due to a change in tax regulations enacted and effective during the higher effective tax rate in the prior fiscal year was mainly due to an additional tax expense of million as a result of the international reorganization 
as a result of our efforts to realign operations and tax structure  we anticipate our tax rate going forward to be in the low range 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased million to million in fiscal versus million in fiscal driven primarily by increased net sales to customers within our wireless sector  which increased million and comprised approximately of net sales in fiscal versus approximately during fiscal the increase in wireless net sales was largely due to the ramp up of new programs and unit volume shipment increases to three customers offset by declines in unit volume shipments to a fourth customer 
due to the success of our customer diversification efforts  sales to our four largest customers represented approximately   and of total sales for fiscal year as compared to approximately of sales to one customer in fiscal net sales to the consumer electronics sector increased million to million versus million in fiscal as a result of new program wins and unit volume increases 
net sales to the industrial sector  our third largest sector  decreased or million to million for the year ended september  versus million in the prior fiscal year mainly due to continued unit volume declines 
cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to for fiscal versus for fiscal the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was driven by several factors 
the main driver was favorable customer mix changes  followed by cost leveraging from improved factory utilization and improved manufacturing yields 
in the previous fiscal year  manufacturing yields were negatively impacted by the substantially larger number of new high volume program ramp ups that occurred during that time 
this along with significant increases in overhead spending driven by the million mfc capacity expansion that was on going throughout the second half of fiscal resulted in increased cost of sales  due to the leveraging of fixed overhead expenses 
gross profit increased to million in the year ended september  versus million in the prior year  an increase of 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to for fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit is primarily due to a favorable customer mix change followed by improved plant utilization which leveraged our cost structure and improved manufacturing yields in the current fiscal year 
gross profits in the prior fiscal year were adversely impacted by the cost of sales increases stated above 
research and development 
research and development expenses remained relatively unchanged at million for the years ended september  and sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
sales representative commissions and other sales related expense increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in commission expense related to the higher increased net sales on relatively stable average commission rates as well as a million increase in customer support expenses primarily related to our netherlands sales office and our new asian regional office in singapore 
compensation and benefit expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of net sales  compensation and benefit expense for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal  primarily due to the leveraging of expense over the higher net sales volumes 
general and administrative expense 
the million increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to a million increase in compensation and benefits related to headcount increases in the us  china and singapore  increased professional fees of million  increased depreciation expense of million and increased information systems infrastructure costs of million  offset by a decrease of million  primarily related to a reduction in litigation expenses incurred in the prior year related to the terminated offer to 
table of contents acquire all of the outstanding shares of mfs technology ltd 
the mfs offer 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expense decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to the leveraging of expense on the higher net sales 
asset impairment and restructuring cost 
during the fiscal year ended we recorded an asset impairment and restructuring charge of million related to the restructuring of our wholly owned subsidiary  aurora optical in tucson  arizona 
no charges were recorded during the prior fiscal year 
terminated acquisition costs 
during the fiscal year ended september   we recorded a million non recurring charge to write off deferred transaction costs related to the termination of the mfs offer 
no charges were recorded during the fiscal year ended september  interest income 
interest income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  due to additional cash balances available for investment 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is attributable to reduced borrowings on our lines of credit during fiscal other expense income  net 
net other expense income changed to an expense of million for the year ended september  from income of million for the prior year 
the change is primarily due to a million loss on foreign exchange in the current fiscal year versus a gain from foreign exchange of million during the prior year and a million charge related to the impairment of our long term investments in auction rate securities 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  due to a worsening of the economic and credit markets and significant changes in interest rates for short term treasury bills  we determined that the impairment in value of our auction rate securities was other than temporary and therefore we recorded the charge against net income 
the increase in loss on foreign exchange was due to the significant devaluation of the us dollar against the chinese rmb  japanese yen  and other major foreign currencies 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was a provision of  compared to a benefit of for fiscal the higher effective tax provision was primarily due to increased income generated in the us  a higher tax jurisdiction 
we recorded additional tax expense of million as a result of international reorganization efforts and the transition of technology to further strengthen our asian operations 
the higher effective tax benefit in the prior fiscal year ended september  was mainly due to foreign tax credits offsetting us taxes  the tax benefit of losses generated in the us  a higher tax jurisdiction  and income generated in china  a lower tax jurisdiction 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations and borrowings under our various credit facilities 
our principal uses of cash have been to finance working capital  facility expansions and other capital expenditures 
we anticipate these uses will continue to be our principal uses of cash in the future 
global financial and credit markets recently have been  and continue to be  extremely unstable and unpredictable 
worldwide economic conditions have been weak and may be further deteriorating 
this instability could affect the prices at which we could make any such sales  which could also adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
these conditions could also negatively affect our ability to secure funds or raise capital at a reasonable cost  if needed 
it is our practice to carefully monitor the state of our business  cash requirements and capital structure 
we believe that funds generated from our operations and available from our borrowing facilities will be sufficient to fund current business operations as well as anticipated growth over at least the next twelve months 
we also believe we will have sufficient capital to fund our operations without the need to derive cash from the sale of our 
table of contents auction rate securities  however  there can be no assurance that any growth will occur and unexpected events may result in our need to raise additional capital 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact its valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities  as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  market interest rates  discount rates and ongoing strength 
market variables utilized in developing the valuation model for these securities include relative yields on federal student loan securities  average day t bill rates  day libor rates  interest rate spreads as determined by the changing credit market environment and quality of market credit and liquidity

during fiscal  net income of million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization  gain on equipment disposal  stock based compensation expense and related tax benefit  deferred taxes  impairments and provision for doubtful accounts  generated million of operating cash 
this amount was increased by million generated from working capital 
changes in the principal components of operating cash flows in our fiscal year were as follows our net accounts receivable decreased to million at september  from million for the prior year  or 
the decrease in outstanding accounts receivable is attributable to a decrease in day s sales outstanding due to improved customer payment terms and collections 
our net inventory balances decreased to million at september  from million for the prior year  a decrease of 
inventory decreased as a result of activities in our manufacturing operations to reduce cycle times and the implementation of just in time supplier inventory stocking initiatives  partially offset by increased inventory purchased at year end in support of higher anticipated business volumes 
our accounts payable decreased to million at september  from million in the prior year  a decrease of  as a result of the just in time purchases previously mentioned 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for fiscal versus million in the prior year due to the increased fixed asset base  mainly at mfc and mfc our principal investing and financing activities in our fiscal year were as follows net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal capital expenditures included cash purchases of million of capital equipment and other assets  which were primarily related to the mfc and mfc manufacturing capacity expansion 
as of september   we had outstanding purchase commitments totaling million 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal and consisted of cash generated of million of income tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options  million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options  million of debt issuance costs  offset by cash used for the repurchase of common stock of million

the fasb launches accounting standards codification the fasb has established the accounting standards codification codification or asc as the single source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by non governmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification will become non authoritative 
following the codification  the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts 
instead  it will issue accounting standards updates  which will serve to update the codification  provide background information about the guidance and provide the basis for conclusions on the changes to the codification 
gaap is not intended to be changed as a result of the fasb s codification project  but it will change the way the guidance is organized and presented 
as a result  these changes will have a significant impact on how companies reference gaap in their financial statements and in their accounting policies for financial statements 
table of contents issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  we have implemented the codification in this annual report by providing a plain english approach when describing any new or updated authoritative guidance 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued revised authoritative guidance regarding the measurement of liabilities at fair value which provides clarification that in circumstances where a quoted market price in an active market for an identical liability is not available  a reporting entity must measure fair value of the liability using one of the following techniques the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset  quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets  or another valuation technique  such as a present value technique or the amount that the reporting entity would pay to transfer the identical liability or would receive to enter into the identical liability 
this statement becomes effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance  which is the first quarter of fiscal we do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which revises the approach to determining when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or not controlled through voting rights referred to as a variable interest entity or vie should be consolidated 
the new consolidation model for vies considers whether the enterprise has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and shares in the significant risks and rewards of the entity 
this guidance requires companies to continually reassess their involvement with vies to determine if consolidation is appropriate and provide additional disclosures about their involvement with them 
this guidance is effective for our fiscal year and we do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb revised the authoritative guidance for determining the fair value of a financial asset in a market that is not active 
specifically  it clarifies how management s internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present  observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account  and the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value 
this guidance is effective immediately and we noted that there was no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share eps under the two class method 
it affects entities that accrue or pay non forfeitable cash dividends on share based payment awards during the awards service period 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which is october  for the mflex  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
this guidance encourages  but does not require  comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption 
we have determined that this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued revised the authoritative guidance for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this revised guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years  which is january  for mflex 
in accordance with the guidance  the we deferred adoption for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
we do not believe that this revised guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb revised the authoritative guidance for business combinations  which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquiror of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
the guidance also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning december   which is october  for the mflex 
we do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for a non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
this guidance is effective beginning october   and we do not believe that it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in liquidity  market rates and foreign exchange rates 
at september   no amounts were outstanding under our loan agreements with bank of america  na  shanghai pudong development bank or bank of china 
the amounts outstanding under these loan agreements at any time may fluctuate and we may from time to time be subject to refinancing risk 
we do not believe that a change of basis points in interest would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition based on our current borrowing level 
foreign currency risk we derive a substantial portion of our sales outside of the us approximately million  or  of total shipments to these foreign manufacturers during fiscal  were made in us dollars with the remaining balance of our net sales denominated in rmb 
the exchange rate for the rmb to the us dollar has been an average of rmb per us dollar for fiscal in addition  we are potentially subject to a maximum daily appreciation against the us dollar 
to date  we generally do not consider it necessary to hedge against currency risk  as a significant portion of our material cost of sales is denominated in us dollars  eliminating much of the need to hedge 
however  we continue to be vulnerable to appreciation or depreciation of foreign currencies against the us dollar 
liquidity risk as a result of the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  during auctions for investments in auction rate securities held by us failed 
an auction fails when there is insufficient demand 

table of contents however  a failed auction does not represent a default by the issuer 
due to the absence of a liquid market  we had reclassified our investments in auction rate securities from current assets to non current assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the prior year 
when liquidity for these types of investments returned in the market  we intended to sell these investments or reclassify them back to current assets 
the issuer of these securities could also potentially agree to redeem these securities in the future 
we do not believe that the lack of liquidity relating to auction rate securities will have an impact on our ability to fund operations 
all of our auction rate securities are rated aaa aaa  are collateralized by student loans substantially guaranteed by the us government and continue to pay interest in accordance with their contractual terms 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact the valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
as of september   the fair value of our auction rate securities of million was determined using a model that calculates the present value of the expected future cash flows from our securities and other indications of value  and as a consequence of our belief that the impairment is of a temporary nature and non credit loss related  we reclassified the aggregate charges of million from our results of operations to accumulated other comprehensive income as of april  and planned to record all net unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in september  we entered into a written agreement with ubs ag ubs  the fund manager with whom we hold our auction rate securities  which allows us to sell the auction rate securities to ubs at par value during the period beginning june  through july  we plan to complete the sale of these securities in july   and therefore have reclassified these investments as short term assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal our agreement related to the auction rate securities represent firm commitments in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance  which defines a firm commitment as an agreement with an unrelated party  binding on both parties and usually legally enforceable 
the enforceability of the agreement results in a put option and is recognized as a freestanding asset separate from the auction rate securities in the consolidated balance sheet 
we have elected to measure the put option at fair value  which permits us to elect the fair value option for recognizing financial assets  in order to match the changes in the fair value of the auction rate securities 
we expect that the future changes in the fair value of the put option will approximate fair value movements in the related auction rate securities 
prior to accepting the agreement from the fund manager  we recorded auction rate securities investments as available for sale and reported any unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet 
in connection with the acceptance of the agreement from the fund manager  we transferred the auction rate securities from investments available for sale to trading securities during the fourth fiscal quarter of as allowed by the fasb authoritative guidance
