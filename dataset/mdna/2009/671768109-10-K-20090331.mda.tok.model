the following presents management s discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations 
you should read the discussion in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ significantly from those described in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
this discussion is intended to assist in understanding its financial condition and results of operations 
restatement on march   a form k filed under item by the company announced that it had concluded that its adoption of sfas was non substantive 
in connection with the foregoing  management concluded that the annual audited financial statements for the year ended december   as well as the previously filed interim unaudited financial statements for the quarters ended march   june   and september   should no longer be relied upon and that the company needed to restate these previously issued financial statements 
in lieu of refilling these quarterly and annual reports  we have included in this report substantially all of the information required to be included in such quarterly and annual reports 
for a detailed description of the cause and financial impact of the restatement  see note to the consolidated financial statements  included herein in part iii  item comparison of results of operations for the years ended december   and net income for the year ended december   the company reported an increase in net income of percent to million compared to  for the year ended december  net income per diluted share increased percent to compared to for the prior year period 
returns on average assets and average equity were percent and percent  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to percent and percent for the prior year period 
net interest income net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
the percent increase in net interest income was due primarily to growth in average earning assets 
net interest margin is interest income earned on loans  securities  and other earning assets  less interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings  expressed as a percentage of total average earning assets 
the net interest margin for the year ended december  was percent compared to percent for the prior year 
the average yield on earning assets for the current period was percent compared to percent for the year ended december   and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities was percent for the current period compared to percent for the year ended december  the decline in interest rate spread from percent to percent was further impacted by a decline in the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities  which decreased from percent at december  to percent at december  as the economy weakened in the latter part of the federal reserve board decreased short term rates and the yield curve began to take on an upward sloping shape  as short term interest rates fell below interest rates for longer maturity investment instruments 
between september  and december   the federal reserve board decreased short term interest rates ten times for a total of basis points 
the rapid decline in short term interest rates immediately impacts the company s yield on variable rate loans  which represent approximately percent of the company s total interest earning assets 
however  the impact on interest bearing liabilities  particularly certificates of deposit  occur as the fixed rate liabilities mature and reprice at market interest rates 
therefore  when the federal reserve board decreases short term interest rates rapidly it has a short term negative impact on the company s net interest margin 
generally  once the fixed rate liabilities reprice at market rates the net interest margin returns to previous levels 
the company is beginning to see fixed rate liabilities  primarily certificates of deposit  reprice at lower levels  but intense local competition for deposits could negatively impact the company s net interest margin in the future 
the company is attempting to negate the potential negative impact to its net interest margin by focusing on attracting lower cost deposits  particularly business demand deposit accounts 
total average interest earning assets were million for the year ended december   increasing by million or when compared to an average of million for the year ended december  increases in average balances by earning asset category were as follows average loans increased by million or from million in to million in  taxable investments  trading securities and restricted equity securities increased by million or from million in to million in  and federal funds sold and interest bearing bank deposits increased by million or from million in to million in total average interest bearing liabilities increased by million with interest bearing deposit accounts increasing million or and borrowings increasing million or 
total interest income for increased by million to million compared million for the prior year 
the increase was a result of million from increased earning asset levels and was offset by a decrease of million due to the rate environment 
total interest expense grew by  with million due to increased interest bearing liabilities and was offset by a decrease of million due to the rate environment

rate volume analysis the following table analyzes the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the table distinguishes between changes attributable to volume changes in volume multiplied by the prior period s rate  changes attributable to rate changes in rate multiplied by the prior period s volume  and net change the sum of the previous columns 
the change attributable to both rate and volume changes in rate multiplied by changes in volume has been allocated proportionately to both the changes attributable to volume and the changes attributable to rate

provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level we deem appropriate 
in evaluating the allowance for loan losses  we consider factors that include growth and composition of the loan portfolio  historical loan loss experience  individual loans that may have estimated losses  and other relevant factors 
the primary reason for the increased provision from to was an increase in loans and loan net charge offs from to the increase in the provision was based on the bank s assessment of the strong credit quality of the company s current loan portfolio as well as a low level of charge offs in the last three fiscal years 
the allowance for loan losses to total loans was percent  percent  and percent as of december   and  respectively 
noninterest income the major components of noninterest income are shown in table noninterest income for the company consists of revenues generated principally from service charges on deposit accounts  loan origination fees on sold mortgage loans  investment and insurance commissions  bank owned life insurance income  and other service charges and fees 
noninterest income totaled million for  up million  or percent  from million for service fees and charges  which represent a relatively stable and predictable source of noninterest income  totaled  for the current year  a percent increase over the  of service fees and charges earned for mortgage loan fee income was negatively impacted by more by the poor economic environment in compared to  and totaled  for the current year  a percent decrease over the  of mortgage loan fee income earned for the bank s investment services group  which services its banking offices  and the oak ridge wealth management division  which was formed in and operates independently of the bank  comprise all of the investment and insurance commissions noninterest category 
investment and insurance commissions totaled  for the current year  a percent decrease over the  earned in  largely due to a decline in the value of assets under management for both the investment services group and the oak ridge wealth management business units 
revenue in both these areas is positively correlated with the underlying value of assets under management 
income earned on bank owned life insurance totaled  for the current year  a percent increase over the  earned in fee income from accounts receivable financing totaled  for the current year  a percent increase over the  earned in this increase is largely due to the addition of new customers in other service charges and fees benefited from the bank s increased number of product offerings and deposit accounts  and totaled  for the current year  a percent increase over the  earned in noninterest income totaled million for  up  or percent  from million for service fees and charges  totaled  for  a percent increase over the  of service fees and charges earned for mortgage loan fee income totaled  for  a percent increase over the  of mortgage loan fee income earned for the bank s investment services group  which services its banking offices  were joined in by two additional financial advisors which generally operate independently of the company and do business as oak ridge wealth management 
investment and insurance commissions totaled  for  a percent increase over the  earned in this increase was largely due to the addition of oak ridge wealth management revenue in addition to increased revenue from its investment services group 
income earned on bank owned life insurance totaled  for  a percent decline over the  earned in the small increase from to was largely due to slightly lower interest rates on the underlying insurance policies in compared to fee income from accounts receivable financing totaled  for  a percent increase over the  earned in this increase is largely due to the addition of new customers in other service charges and fees benefited from its increased number of product offerings and deposit accounts  and totaled  in  a percent increase over the  earned in in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this statement allows an irrevocable election to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis  with unrealized gains and losses recognized currently in earnings 
under this statement  the fair value option may only be elected at the time of initial recognition of a financial asset or financial liability or upon the occurrence of certain specified events 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption permitted if fasb statement no

 effective january   but in march of judged the early adoption to be non substantive 
as a result of the impairment and resulting sale of the company s security portfolio  the company recorded a  impairment loss on securities and a  loss on sale of securities

the million or percent increase reflects the continuing efforts to expand the company s infrastructure and branch network

the major components of noninterest expense are shown in table salaries and employee benefits for the year ended december  were million reflecting an increase of  compared to million for the year ended december  increases in salaries and employee benefits were due to an increase in support positions to service the company s continued growth  as well as the opening of the bank s fifth banking office in january of occupancy expense for the year ended december  was  reflecting an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  equipment expense for the year ended december  was  reflecting a  increase when compared to  for the year ended december  both increases in occupancy expense and equipment expense were due to the fifth banking office which opened in january data processing expense for the year ended december  was  reflecting an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in data processing expense was due to the renewal of the contract with our core system vendor in march as well as continued growth 
professional and advertising expenses for the year ended december  were million reflecting an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  increases in professional and advertising expenses were due to increased advertising  marketing  legal  audit and accounting expenses in over stationary and supplies for the year ended december  was  reflecting an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in stationary and supplies was due to growth and the fifth banking office 
telecommunications expense for the year ended december  were  reflecting an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  a continuing investment in increased bandwidth as well as the bank s fifth office which opened in january to support the company s growth caused most of the increase between the two years 
other noninterest expenses for the year ended december  were  reflecting an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in other noninterest expense was due to growth and the fifth banking office 
non interest expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million  or percent  increase was mostly due to new banking offices that were opened in august and june  as well as an increase in positions to support the company s continued growth and to service the company s new extended business hours that were implemented in october of the increases in occupancy and equipment expenses were due to the opening of two new offices in and table sources of noninterest expense years ended december  in thousands salaries and employee benefits occupancy expense equipment expense data processing professional and advertising stationary and supplies telecommunications other expense total noninterest expense income taxes income tax expense is based on amounts reported in the statement of income after adjustments for non taxable income and non deductible expenses and consists of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes on temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future federal and state income tax consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
income tax expense was  for and  for  respectively 
net deferred income tax benefits of approximately  and  at december  and  respectively  were included in other assets 
at december  and   and  respectively  of the total deferred tax asset are applicable to the allowance for loan loss and accrued compensation  respectively 
the company s deferred income tax benefits and liabilities are the result of temporary differences in provisions for loan losses  depreciation  and investment security discount accretion 
analysis of financial condition average earning assets increased to million in  or percent  from million in earning assets represented percent of total assets during the year ended december   and and percent during the years ended december  and respectively 
the mix of average earning assets changed from december  to december   with loans declining from percent of total assets in to percent in  and investment securities increasing from percent of total assets in to percent in the shift in earning assets to investments from loans is a conscious strategy by management to try to invest excess funds in investment securities rather than loans 
management expects this trend to continue in  but expects loan growth to continue  albeit at a slower rate than in prior years

the company emphasizes commercial loans to small and medium sized businesses  real estate loans  and consumer loans 
tables and set forth  at the dates indicated  the company s loan portfolio composition by type of loan 
the majority of loans are secured by real estate  with the biggest concentrations in that category being residential  families  nonfarm  nonresidential  and construction and development 
the large shift in balances from to from commercial and industrial to nonfarm  nonresidential was due to a detailed review of loan types by bank management in table loan portfolio summary at december  dollars in thousands construction and development secured by farmland residential  families residential  or more families nonfarm  nonresidential total real estate commercial and industrial consumer total table loan portfolio summary  as a percent of total loans at december  construction and development secured by farmland residential  families residential  or more families nonfarm  nonresidential total real estate commercial and industrial consumer total table presents the maturity repricing distribution of loans as of december  table loan maturity repricing distribution commercial and industrial construction and development others total amount dollars in thousands three months or less over months to months over year to years over years total loans asset quality maintaining a high level of asset quality is a primary goal in the bank s lending function  and we employ a formal internal loan review process to ensure adherence to the lending policies approved by the bank s board of directors 
a systematic evaluation process fundamentally drives the function of determining the allowance for loan losses 
this ongoing process serves as the basis for determining  on a monthly basis  the allowance for loan losses and any resulting provision to be charged against earnings 
consideration is given to the value and adequacy of collateral  economic conditions in its market area and other factors 
for loans determined to be impaired  the allowance is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires material estimates  including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the appropriate level of reserve to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the bank s policy regarding past due loans normally requires a prompt charge off to the allowance for loan losses following timely collection efforts and a thorough review 
further efforts are then pursued through various means available 
loans carried in a nonaccrual status are generally collateralized and the possibility of future losses is considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
nonperforming assets table sets forth information with respect to nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  total nonperforming loans nonaccrual loans plus restructured loans  and total nonperforming assets

management does not expect any significant loss of principal related to the nonperforming loans in excess of the provision the company has reserved through its allowance model for these loans 
the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  including the recognition of interest income on its loan portfolio  unless a loan is placed on a nonaccrual basis 
loans are placed on a nonaccrual basis when they become days past due or whenever management believes that collection has become doubtful 
amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
loans are charged off when the collection of principal and interest has become doubtful and the loans no longer can be considered sound collectible assets or  in the case of unsecured loans  when they become days past due 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate by management to provide for anticipated loan losses based on management s assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including a review of problem loans  business conditions and loss experience and an overall evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to operations and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
while management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses  unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustments to the allowance for loan losses  and net income could be significantly affected  if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination 
in addition  various regulatory agencies may require the company to make adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following table shows the allocation of the company s allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated 
the allocation is based on an evaluation of defined loan problems  historical ratios of loan losses and other factors that may affect future loan losses in the categories of loans shown

the trust preferred securities presently qualify as tier regulatory capital and are reported in federal reserve regulatory reports as a minority consolidated interest in a consolidated subsidiary 
the junior subordinated debentures do not qualify as tier regulatory capital

these funds  together with loan repayments  are used to make loans and to fund continuing operations 
in addition  at december   the company had credit available with the fhlb of approximately million and additional availability under credit lines with a financial institution of million 
total deposits were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company has relied on time deposits and borrowed funds to fund loan demand that has exceeded the rate of growth in core deposits 
certificates of deposit are the only deposit accounts that have stated maturity dates  and those deposits are generally considered to be rate sensitive 
at december  and  time deposits represented percent and percent  respectively  of total deposits 
certificates of deposit of  or more represented percent and percent of total deposits at december  and  respectively 
the company has brokered certificates of deposit that  as of december   amounted to approximately million or percent of total deposits and percent of total certificates of deposit 
all but  of total brokered certificates of deposits consisted of certificates issued through the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars 
although classified as brokered deposits  they are issued to individuals  businesses and not for profit entities located in the company s geographic market territory 
the company has certificates of deposit that are accepted on the internet through qwick rate s cd clearinghouse qwick rate 
on december   those internet deposits amounted to approximately million or percent of total deposits and percent of total certificates of deposit 
with the exception of these internet deposits  management believes most of the company s other time deposits are relationship oriented and  while it will be necessary to pay competitive rates to retain those deposits at their maturities  there are other subjective factors that will determine their continued retention 
based upon prior experience  management anticipates that a substantial portion of outstanding certificates of deposit will renew upon maturity 
management anticipates that the company will rely primarily upon customer deposits  qwick rate deposits  borrowed funds  investment repayments  loan repayments and current earnings to provide liquidity  and will use funds thus generated to make loans and to purchase securities  primarily securities issued by the federal government and its agencies and mortgage backed securities 
as of december   liquid assets cash and due from banks  interest earning bank deposits  federal funds sold  time deposits in other banks and investment securities available for sale were approximately million  which represented percent of total assets and percent of total deposits 
at december   outstanding commitments to extend credit were million and available line of credit balances totaled million 
management believes that the combined aggregate liquidity position of the company is sufficient to meet the funding requirements of loan demand and deposit maturities and withdrawals in the near term 
the bank is subject to minimum capital requirements 
as the following table indicates  at december   all capital ratios place the bank in excess of the minimum necessary to be considered well capitalized under bank regulatory guidelines

at december   the company s equity to asset ratio was percent 
asset liability management the company s risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments  or market risk  is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the primary objective of the company s asset liability management activities is to maximize net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for establishing policies to limit exposure to interest rate risk  and to ensure procedures are established to monitor compliance with those policies 
the guidelines established by alco are reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
historically  the most common method of estimating interest rate risk was to measure the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap  typically one year 
under this method  a bank is considered liability sensitive when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets within the one year horizon 
however  assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics may not reprice at the same time or to the same degree 
as a result  the company s gap does not necessarily predict the impact of changes in general levels of interest rates on net interest income 
table illustrates the gap position of the company as of december  table gap position terms to repricing at december  with in months to months year to years over years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable adjustable rate fixed rate investment securities federal funds sold interest earning deposits in other banks stock in fhlb of atlanta total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities deposits now money market and savings time total deposits junior subordinated debentures other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap per period cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative gap as a percentage of total interest earning assets cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities management believes that the simulation of net interest income in different interest rate environments provides a more meaningful measure of interest rate risk 
income simulation analysis captures not only the potential of all assets and liabilities to mature or reprice  but also the probability that they will do so 
income simulation also attends to the relative interest rate sensitivities of these items  and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
finally  income simulation permits management to assess the probable effects on the balance sheet not only of changes in interest rates  but also of proposed strategies for responding to them 
the company s income simulation model was developed by profitstars  a financial services consulting firm that provides asset liability management solutions  product pricing solutions and other products and services to banks  thrifts  and credit unions nationwide 
the model analyzes interest rate sensitivity by projecting net interest income and net income over the next months in a flat rate scenario versus net interest income and net income in alternative interest rate scenarios 
management continually reviews and refines its interest rate risk management process in response to the changing economic climate 
the company s alco policy has established that interest income sensitivity will be considered acceptable if net interest income does not decline from the flat rate scenario more than percent  percent  and percent in the plus and minus  and basis point scenarios  respectively 
these interest rate scenarios assume that rates increase immediately and permanently 
at december   the company s income simulation model projects that net interest income would decline percent  percent and percent in the plus  and basis point change scenarios  respectively  would increase percent and 
percent in the minus and basis point scenarios  and decrease 
percent in the minus basis point change scenario  respectively 
all of these forecasts are within an acceptable level of interest rate risk per the policies established by alco 
in the event the model indicates an unacceptable level of risk  management could undertake a number of actions that would reduce this risk  including the sale of a portion of the company s available for sale investment portfolio  the use of risk management strategies such as interest rate swaps and caps  or the extension of the maturities of its short term borrowings

the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  which are based upon historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to its audited financial statements 
management considers the following accounting policies to be most critical in their potential effect on the company s financial position or results of operations interest income recognition loans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay off are reported at their outstanding principal amount adjusted for any charge offs and the allowance for loan losses 
loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are capitalized and recognized as an adjustment of the yield of the related loan 
discounts and premiums on any purchased residential real estate loans are amortized to income using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity  adjusted for anticipated prepayments 
discounts and premiums on any purchased consumer loans are recognized over the expected lives of the loans using methods that approximate the interest method 
interest is accrued and credited to income based on the principal amount outstanding 
the accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when  in management s opinion  the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due 
when interest accrual is discontinued  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed 
interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received 
when facts and circumstances indicate the borrower has regained the ability to meet the required payments  the loan is returned to accrual status 
past due status of loans is determined based on contractual terms 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  the company does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures 
regulatory matters management is not aware of any known trends  events  uncertainties or current recommendations by regulatory authorities that will have  or that are reasonably likely to have  a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources  or other operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices a commercial bank has an asset and liability structure that is distinctly different from that of a company with substantial investments in plant and inventory because the major portion of its assets are monetary in nature 
as a result  a bank s performance may be significantly influenced by changes in interest rates 
although the banking industry is more affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation in the prices of goods and services  inflation is a factor that may influence interest rates 
however  the frequency and magnitude of interest rate fluctuations do not necessarily coincide with changes in the general inflation rate 
inflation does affect operating expenses in that personnel expenses and the cost of supplies and outside services tend to increase more during periods of high inflation 
therefore  the company can best counter inflation over the long term by managing net interest income and controlling net increases in noninterest income and expense
