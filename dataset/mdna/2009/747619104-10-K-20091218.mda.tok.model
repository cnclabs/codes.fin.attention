exclusive of items shown separately below 
overview the company continued to experience downward trends in its primary end markets resulting in a decline in sales and overall operating income 
housing starts have declined significantly in recent years from record highs in fiscal of over million to million in  million in  and million in fiscal housing starts are estimated to be below million units  down approximately from prior year 
additionally  residential remodeling is estimated to be down approximately in fiscal compared to following a decline the previous year 
while the condition of the company s primary end markets remain historically weak  the company continues to demonstrate its ability to outperform the market by its deftness at developing new products  cultivating new customers  as well as benefiting from its longstanding relationships with leading customers who the company believes continue to grow share 
all of these factors  coupled with a continuous focus on the controllable internal factors and financial position of the company  resulted in the company not only performing relatively well in difficult times  but positioning it to gain additional market share  and grow as the housing market recovers 
the first half of fiscal year was extremely difficult  driven by the collapse of the housing market along with a collapse of aluminum prices to an inflation adjusted record low 
with markets still depressed  the company saw a sales improvement in the second half of the fiscal year due to a better than expected seasonal pickup from the building season 
despite the difficult economic challenges in and resulting pressure on sales volume  quanex produced respectable cash generation in  the result of significant improvements in working capital  a focus on cost controls  lean initiatives and price realization 

table of contents the company believes that consumer demand for more energy efficient products and its ability to provide innovative window and door systems  in addition to stand alone components  will fuel its organic growth 
the company works closely with its customers in all phases of product development  which is critical to increasing revenue and a significant factor for its success in this otherwise difficult period 
efforts are also ongoing to increase business in the repair and remodel sector of the residential market 
demographics for long term housing demand in the united states remain favorable when factoring the projected population increase and continuing immigration 
quanex began cross selling initiatives in that combine the best design  engineering and marketing talent within engineered products 
the company believes that taking a more disciplined approach to the way it seeks new business opportunities will make it a more successful company and a stronger competitor by offering customers a more robust slate of systems  products and services 
the company is elevating its programs to develop more energy efficient products and just introduced a product energycore that it believes is the most energy efficient window system in the country 
these programs and initiatives coupled with an eventual return to a normal housing market will benefit the segment over the long term 
in addition to the housing market impact on the company s net sales and operating income  the company incurred impairments of its goodwill  and to a lesser extent  its other intangible assets in fiscal of million 
for additional information on the impairment charges see note  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
in fiscal  transaction and other non cash separation expenses negatively impacted the company s selling  general and administrative expense and the resulting overall operating income by million 
partially offsetting this in fiscal was the recognition of million in other  net for the receipt of merger proceeds by the company s rabbi trust 
business segments business segments are reported in accordance with asc topic segment reporting asc 
asc requires that the company disclose certain information about its operating segments  where operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker codm in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
quanex has two reportable segments engineered products and aluminum sheet products 
the engineered products segment produces finished products  components and systems serving the window and door industry  while the aluminum sheet products segment produces mill finished and coated aluminum sheet serving the broader building products markets and secondary markets like recreational vehicles and capital equipment 
the main market drivers of the two segments are residential housing starts and remodeling expenditures 
for financial reporting purposes  three of the company s four operating segments  homeshield  truseal and mikron  have been aggregated into the engineered products reportable segment 
the remaining division  nichols aluminum aluminum sheet products  is reported as a separate reportable segment with corporate other comprised of corporate office expenses and certain inter division eliminations 
the sale of products between segments is recognized at market prices 
the financial performance of the operations is based upon operating income 
the segments follow the accounting principles described in the summary of significant accounting principles  see item  note the two reportable segments value inventory on a fifo or weighted average basis while the lifo reserve relating to those operations accounted for under the lifo method of inventory valuation is computed on a consolidated basis in a single pool and treated as a corporate item

the us housing market deteriorated approximately from to following a decline from fiscal to while residential remodeling activity is estimated to be down in each of the last two fiscal years 
comparatively  net sales at engineered products were down only in fiscal and only in fiscal the company s ability to consistently outperform the market  even in this very tough economic environment  is testimony to the market leading positions its customers hold in the window and door industry  and of significant importance  the company s collaboration with them on a broad range of new product and program initiatives 
the and decline in net sales at the engineered products segment in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  is due to reduced volumes attributable to the continued falloff of housing starts and lower remodeling and repair expenditures 
partially offsetting the impact of the market falloff was targeted price increases that took effect across the segment in late and and the continued growth of new products and programs 
additionally  the company believes that the steady demand it saw during the fiscal fourth quarter of indicated that the company s customers continue to find success gaining more share in the residential remodeling and replacement market  driven in part by the  tax credit for purchasing energy efficient replacement windows 
the engineered products segment continues to develop and is currently producing and selling products that position it well for the anticipated increase in green building as the company s thermally efficient products are viewed more favorably by consumers when compared to less efficient products 
additionally  the company s current product offerings position it well as more stringent building codes and standards are instituted  the broadest of which are the new energy star standards that become more stringent in future years 
net sales less cost of sales for fiscal compared to and have declined each year primarily as the result of reduced volumes from the depressed building products market over the periods 
the company has taken the necessary actions to right size the business by reducing variable and fixed costs and will continue to size the operations to match on going demand 
net sales less cost of sales as a percent of net sales has increased sequentially from the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of fiscal as a direct result of the company s right sizing efforts and price realization combined with higher sales volume 
as a result of the company s ability to right size to demand  along with price realization and growth in higher margin products  the margins for the full year of fiscal rose to fiscal levels even though housing starts in fiscal were less than half those in exclusive of items shown separately below

table of contents the segment reduced its selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal compared to fiscal by million 
this was achieved through various means including reduced headcount  less outside contract services  a continued emphasis on cost control for various programs and reduction in variable pay incentives corresponding to lower levels of earnings 
during the first quarter of  the company completed the consolidation of two fenestration component facilities into a single facility in order to help reduce operating costs and increase operating efficiencies 
the company anticipates demand driven sizing efforts will remain a focus in fiscal the million non cash impairment charge reflected in represents million of impairment on acquired intangible assets and million of impairment charge on goodwill

the company will incur some additional costs  including legal  security and freight costs  to handle the strike

as previously discussed  these primary market drivers declined from to the decrease in net sales at the aluminum sheet products segment was primarily the result of reduced volume due to the very soft primary and secondary markets  pounds shipped declined by in fiscal compared to fiscal following an volume decline in compared to the company believes that its aluminum shipments were in line with industry demand during the first half of fiscal but were better than industry demand during the second half of the fiscal year as the company was able to capitalize on short lead time sales opportunities and solid execution by the aluminum sheet products team 
additionally  net sales were down as the average selling price during was approximately below the same period primarily due to lower aluminum prices 
the london metals exchange lme aluminum price fell dramatically during the first quarter of  down approximately to an inflation adjusted record low price of per pound

fiscal spreads per pound were down over spreads per pound in fiscal spreads and operating income were negatively impacted by about million in the first half of due to high scrap inventories combined with the dramatic fall in aluminum prices 
the historically low aluminum prices  combined with relatively high cost aluminum scrap inventory  negatively impacted the segment s spread through the first half of the year 
spread per pound and operating income in the second half of improved over the first half driven primarily by higher lme aluminum prices 
spread per pound in was down approximately compared to  this decline in spread was primarily due to a lower mix of painted sheet and to a lesser extent in from pricing from over capacity pressures 
also contributing to the decline in operating income in compared to were increased utility and freight costs 
the aluminum sheet products operating income and margins are impacted by changes in lme as material spreads are correlated with aluminum prices over time 
declines in lme result in spread compression  however  as lme rebounds  spread and profits expand

the amounts presented above are only the incremental amount of expense that was recognized as a result of the accelerated vesting of the various awards and ultimate cash settlement of the stock options 
also  the amounts presented above represent only the expense associated with active quanex building products corporation employees and directors as of the time of the separation 
the same such expense related to vehicular products and former vehicular and corporate employees and directors is included in discontinued operations 
in addition to transaction costs  selling  general  and administrative costs for fiscal  declined due to lower variable pay incentive costs corresponding to the company s lower earnings and lower professional fees 
partially offsetting these declines was an increase in mark to market expense associated with the deferred compensation plan reflecting the increase in the company s stock price as well as the market value of other investments held by the deferred compensation plan during the period

the merger proceeds equated to million to the rabbi trust  which was recorded as income in other  net in the second fiscal quarter of 
table of contents the company s annual effective tax benefit for fiscal was compared to in fiscal and in fiscal this tax rate benefit for is unusually low primarily due to the nondeductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge in the current fiscal year 
in contrast  the rate was higher than normal due to transaction costs that were non deductible for tax purposes with pretax income in for further discussion of the goodwill impairment charge see note  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the lower effective rate in is primarily attributable to an update of the rate on deferred balances

fiscal s results represent only six months of ownership prior to the separation compared to a full year in additionally  is burdened with gerdau s share of transaction costs  stock based compensation modification impact for vehicular products and former corporate employees and loss on extinguishment of convertible debentures 
see note of item for further information regarding the composition of discontinued operations 
outlook fiscal high unemployment  relatively high inventories of new and existing homes for sale  and high rates of foreclosures will continue to be a drag on the company s business for the next twelve months 
however  the company believes both new home construction and remodeling activity bottomed during fiscal  and expects slightly better sales and improved earnings in compared to the company expects the first half of to be challenging and it is uncertain as to how long end markets will remain at depressed levels  so it must continue to operate businesses with reduced staffs and minimal levels of materials 
this uncertainty makes it challenging to precisely estimate segment operating income for fiscal at this time  engineered products is expected to earn million to million in operating income in  predominantly in the second half 
improved earnings in compared to will come from a combination of new product opportunities  new customers  and modest improvements in its two end markets 
aluminum sheet products is expected to earn about million in operating income in  predominantly in the second half 
this guidance assumes an aluminum spread generally in line with  and slightly higher shipments 
this guidance represents an improvement over results that were negatively impacted by about million in the first half due to high scrap inventories combined with a dramatic fall in aluminum prices 
while it is problematic to predict aluminum prices  the company does not expect aluminum prices to fall again in  nor does it expect to be impacted by high scrap inventories to the same extent as financial guidance for engineered products and aluminum sheet products assumes million new home starts and flat to slightly better remodeling activity and excludes estimated corporate expenses of million and any impact from lifo 
additionally  fiscal estimates for capital expenditures  and depreciation and amortization are million and million  respectively 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources of funds the company s principal sources of funds are cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under its million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility 
as of october   the company has a solid liquidity position  comprised of cash and equivalents and adequate availability under the company s credit facility 
the company has million of cash and equivalents  million of current availability under the revolving credit facility and minimal debt of million as of october  the company has grown its cash and equivalents balance steadily throughout from million as of october  to million at october  the company s strategy for cash uses in are to invest in organic growth opportunities  make strategic acquisitions that fit its fenestration vision  continue to fund its cash dividend  and potentially  at times  repurchase stock 
the company s excess cash was invested in money market funds throughout most of fiscal year as well as some commercial paper and auction rate securities preceding the separation 
beginning in september  however  the company s cash has been invested only in treasury money market funds due to the conditions of the financial market 
the company s current investments are with institutions that the company believes to be financially sound 
the company intends to remain in highly rated overnight money market funds following a prudent investment philosophy 
the company had no material losses on its cash and marketable securities investments during fiscal and the credit facility was executed on april  and has a five year term 
proceeds from the credit facility may be used to provide availability for acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures  and general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a spread above libor based on a combined leverage and ratings grid 
there are certain limitations on additional indebtedness  asset or equity sales  and acquisitions 
dividends and other distributions are permitted so long as after giving effect to such dividend or stock repurchase  there is no event of default 
under the credit facility  the company is obligated to comply with certain financial covenants requiring the company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than to and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of no less than to as defined by the indenture  the consolidated leverage ratio is the ratio of consolidated indebtedness as of such date to consolidated ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for the previous four fiscal quarters  and the interest coverage ratio is the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense  in each case for the previous four fiscal quarters 
ebitda is defined by the indenture to include proforma ebitda of acquisitions and to exclude certain items like goodwill and intangible asset impairments and certain other non cash charges 
the availability under the credit facility is a function of both the facility amount utilized and meeting covenant requirements 
additionally  the availability of the credit facility is dependent upon the financial viability of the company s lenders 
the credit facility is funded by a syndicate of nine banks  with three banks comprising over of the commitment 
if any of the banks in the syndicate were unable to perform on their commitments to fund the facility  the availability under the credit facility could be reduced  however  the company has no reason to believe that such liquidity will be unavailable or decreased 
as of october   the company had no borrowings under the credit facility  and the company was in compliance with all credit facility covenants 
although there were no borrowings on the credit facility and there was only million of outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility  the aggregate availability under the credit facility was limited by the consolidated leverage ratio resulting in an availability of million at october  because the consolidated leverage ratio is based on ebitda  falling earnings over the last months and reduced earnings for any future periods could continue to impact the amount available under the credit facility in future quarters  absent any pro forma ebitda benefit from any potential acquisitions 
the company is focused on this matter and will endeavor to maintain the existing credit facility given its favorable terms versus current market terms 
the company believes that it has sufficient funds and adequate financial resources available to meet its anticipated liquidity needs 
the company also believes that cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient in the next twelve months and foreseeable future to finance anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  environmental expenditures  and dividends

offsetting this reduction in conversion capital is the growth in the company s cash and equivalents balance of million during the year  this includes the receipt of million in cash from gerdau  which represented the final separation true up and pertained to the settlement of transaction taxes as the separation was a taxable spin 
the following table summarizes the company s cash flow results from continuing operations for fiscal years  and years ended october  in millions cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities highlights from the company s cash flow results for the fiscal years ended  and are as follows operating activities continuing operations cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal even though the company experienced a decline in its businesses as a direct result of the demand decline in the company s end markets  the company generated good operating cash flow of million during this performance is the result of significant improvements in working capital  particularly better inventory control  and further improvements in receivables collection 
during fiscal  the company contributed million to its pension plan compared to million during fiscal  and did not make any estimated federal tax payments in fiscal the company expects to receive a federal income tax refund in the second half of fiscal the decrease of million in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to primarily related to the decline in year over year operating income from its businesses as a direct result of the depressed housing market 
despite this market slowdown  the company generated million in operating cash flow from continuing operations during fiscal in contrast to  conversion capital accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable increased use of cash approximately million during fiscal primarily due to increased aluminum products inventory levels 
investing activities continuing operations cash spending from investing activities from continuing operations during the twelve months ended october  decreased by million compared to the same prior year period 
capital expenditures for approximate spending during fiscal and even though fiscal included spending to repair its mikron facility in kentucky discussed below

to date  the company has spent approximately million on its repair efforts  this spending is reflected in capital expenditures on the statement of cash flows 
repairs are ongoing  however  the company believes that its net overall cash flows from this event will be minimal due to the company s insurance coverage 
the company expects capital expenditures to approximate million 
the increase in spending from prior year levels relates to organic growth initiatives including capital to support new product development as well as spending on previously deferred projects 
at october   the company had commitments of approximately million for the purchase or construction of capital assets 
the company plans to fund these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
the company continues to evaluate various building products companies as potential acquisitions 
under the current economic environment  the company is focused on preserving capital and thus only anticipates consummating those transactions that can be secured at attractive valuations 
financing activities continuing operations quanex received million in cash from financing activities from continuing operations in fiscal compared to receiving million in and using million in the changes in cash from financing activities from continuing operations over the three years are primarily due to items related to the separation 
the company received million less from financing activities from continuing operations during fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  the company received million of funding from quanex corporation the company s predecessor from the separation pursuant to the terms of the transaction related agreements  this consisted of a million initial funding from quanex corporation  a net million in true up payments from gerdau for the settlement of stock options and change of control agreements and a true up receipt of million from gerdau related to quanex corporation s convertible debentures

the company expects to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends hereafter although payment of future cash dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors  including anticipated cash needs 
in contrast  during fiscal  cash generated from the company s building products divisions were swept and transferred to quanex corporation 
as a result  financing activities from continuing operations reports a disbursement of million to quanex corporation in fiscal  the equal and offsetting receipt of cash is reported in financing activities from discontinued operations as discussed below 

table of contents discontinued operations the company has a centralized cash management function whereby cash flows generated by its businesses are swept to corporate 
all net cash flows through october  from the company s building products businesses were swept to corporate of quanex corporation  as a result of the legal structure of the separation and this centralized cash management function  predominately all cash balances prior to november  are reported in discontinued operations 
in accordance with the various separation agreements  beginning on november   net cash flows from the company s building products businesses were accumulated separately to the benefit of quanex building products and thus reported in continuing operations 
this structure and division of economic interests between the company s building products businesses and its former vehicular products business legacy corporate drives the various historical items reported in cash flows from discontinued operations 
cash flows from discontinued operations in fiscal represent approximately six months of activity as the separation occurred on april  in contrast  cash flows from discontinued operations for represent twelve months of activity 
this shorter period results in lower discontinued operation cash flows from operating activities  less cash spent on discontinued capital expenditures and less cash spent on certain financing activities such as dividends 
there were no operating activity cash flows from discontinued operations for the decline in fiscal cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations compared to fiscal is predominately driven by including twelve months of operations for the vehicular products business compared to approximately six months in additionally  cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations declined due to cash spent on transaction related deal costs
