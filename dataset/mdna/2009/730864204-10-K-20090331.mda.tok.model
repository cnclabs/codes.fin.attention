overview we are engaged in the development  manufacture and marketing of electronic products for use in the gaming and amusement markets 
we currently have two product lines pokerpro and heads up challenge pokerpro the pokerpro system consists of electronic poker table s and related peripheral equipment providing commercial casinos  tribal casinos  cruise ships and card clubs with a fully automated poker room environment designed to improve the profitability of poker by enhancing the operator s revenue opportunities and decreasing their startup and operating costs 
we first introduced pokerpro in late and have continued to invest in features and innovations to enhance the player and operator experience 
we distribute pokerpro using our internal sales force to customers in the united states  canada and cruise ships  generally on a recurring revenue lease model 
internationally  we sell pokerpro to aristocrat for distribution in most markets outside north america 
aristocrat is a leading global provider of gaming solutions including video slot machines  progressive systems and casino management systems and a significant shareholder of the company  owning approximately of our common stock as of december  aristocrat purchases the pokerpro tables from us and assumes responsibility for all marketing  regulatory  distribution and support in their markets 
as of december   there were pokerpro tables  consisting of pokerpro tables on lease with gaming customers at sites in the united states  canada  and on major cruise lines and pokerpro tables sold to aristocrat for lease to its customers internationally 
heads up challenge 
heads up challenge is an innovative amusement platform that enables two players to compete head to head against each other for entertainment purposes in non gambling venues such as bars and restaurants 
we introduced heads up challenge in late as a texas hold em poker amusement game

as of december   we had sold an aggregate of  units since product launch 
general economic and industry conditions during the second half of  global macroeconomic conditions deteriorated rapidly and significantly as a result of challenges in the banking industry  the crisis in the housing market  the decline in the stock market  tightening in the credit markets  inflationary pressures from higher energy  food and fuel costs  disappointing labor market conditions  and an uncertain geopolitical environment 
consumer confidence has suffered and spending on discretionary purchases  including gaming and amusement activities  has declined significantly 
despite deteriorating economic conditions during  we experienced significant growth in both of our product lines  increasing our pokerpro table count by to and launching heads up challenge  selling  units in as compared to in however  we expect economic weakness will continue through the first half of  if not longer  which may impact revenues from existing customers as well as our ability to attract new customers

the svb credit facility is nominally denoted as a million facility with an actual maximum availability that varies based on specified percentages of domestic and foreign accounts receivable and inventory 
based on our accounts receivable and inventory levels on december   as of such date availability under the svb credit facility was approximately million  with no borrowings outstanding 
the svb credit facility has a one year term and bears interest at an annual rate of prime plus 
the svb credit facility includes covenants requiring the achievement of specified financial ratios and thresholds and contains other terms and conditions customary for this type of credit facility

we received net cash proceeds of million after selling our million ars investment to ubs and liquidating our million in advances under the ubs credit facility 
we no longer have any investments in ars or debt with ubs following this transaction 
operations and liquidity management 
the level of additional cash needed to fund our operations is influenced primarily by the following factors  please see item a  risk factors for discussion of other risks and uncertainties that may also impact our liquidity the pace of growth in our casino business in the north american and cruise ship markets and the related investments we may need to make in inventory and pokerpro systems 
o growth in these markets require working capital as the expenditures required to manufacture and install pokerpro tables are generally incurred in advance of product placement  whereas revenues are generally earned over time on a monthly lease basis 
the capital intensive nature of the pokerpro leasing business makes access to the capital markets an important component of managing and growing our business 
the pace of growth in sales of our heads up challenge amusement product and the related investments we may make in inventory and purchase commitments 
o the heads up challenge business model is less capital intensive than pokerpro  generally resulting in upfront product margins 
however  due to long lead times associated with an international supply chain and in order to minimize manufacturing costs  we have entered into significant purchase commitments with our supplier requiring us to purchase inventory in future periods based on forecasts which may not match up with the timing of our product sales 
our ability to control our operating expenses and generate positive operating leverage as we grow 
o we have reorganized our overhead structure and reduced our operating costs significantly between the third quarter of and the first quarter of our ability to further streamline the organization and continue to reduce operating costs is not unlimited and we may need to hire additional personnel or otherwise increase our operating expenses as we grow 
our ability to negotiate favorable payment terms with our customers and vendors 
the impact of the economy or other factors on our customers and suppliers  including the impact on demand for our products and our customers ability to pay us on a timely basis 
we have the ability to impact the timing and extent of our cash needs primarily by managing the pace of growth in both our pokerpro and heads up challenge products and managing our operating expenses 
however  we also have significant contractual obligations and our ability to control both the timing and extent of the cash needs of the business is not unlimited  particularly in light of the current economic climate and the capital intensive nature of the pokerpro business 
our management s strategy is to balance revenue growth with operating expense and working capital management  while carefully monitoring the impact of growth on our cash needs and cash balances 
accordingly  reductions in our working capital investments or declines in demand for our products or continued deterioration in general economic conditions could impact our ability to grow or to effectively manage our liquidity needs 
if we are unable to execute our operating plan  manage our working capital effectively or are impacted by other events  we may need to attempt to raise additional funds through public or private offerings of our securities  additional credit facilities or other sources which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if such sources of capital are not available or not available on sufficiently favorable terms  we may seek other avenues to fund the business  including sale leaseback arrangements  transitioning pokerpro from a capital intensive leasing strategy to a product sale strategy  or seeking to sell assets of all  or a portion of  our operations 
if we decide to raise capital in the equity markets or take other actions  our shareholders could incur significant dilution or diminished valuations  or  if we are unable to raise capital  our ability to effectively operate our business could be impaired 
impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a material effect on our net sales  revenues or income from continuing operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the table below sets forth our known contractual obligations as of december  total less than year years years more than years debt obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total represents the outstanding principal amount and interest on our founder s loan and ubs credit facility 
represents operating lease agreements for office and storage facilities and office equipment 
represents outstanding principal and interest payable under capital lease obligations related to our purchase of internal use erp system 
represents open purchase orders with our vendors  primarily purchase obligations for heads up challenge 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note nature of business and significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity

fas provides entities with the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value

we elected the fair value option for our ars investments as of december  see note  investments in auction rate securities ars 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from both changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
a discussion of our primary market risks is presented below cash and investments 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of december   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
our investments in ars are subject to significant market and interest rate risk due to the failure of the auction process to provide liquidity and due to the long term maturities of the underlying investment securities 
in addition to our investment in ars  as of december   we also held a rights option issued by ubs financial services  giving us the right to put the ars investments back to ubs at par for a specified period of time beginning on january  as of december   the estimated fair value of the investment in ars was million and our cost basis was million 
as of december   the estimated fair value of the rights option was million and our cost basis was zero 
on january   subsequent to the end of  we exercised our rights to put those ars investments back to ubs at par value 
we received net cash proceeds of million after selling our million ars investment to ubs and liquidating our million in advances under the ubs credit facility 
we no longer have any investments in ars or debt with ubs following this transaction we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculation  or trading purposes 
fixed rate debt 
our founders loan bears interest at a fixed annually rate of 
as market interest rates fluctuate  the fair value of our founders debt will also fluctuate 
the estimated fair value of our founders loan as of december  was million 
we estimate a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value by approximately million 
these changes would impact the fair value disclosures for this financial instrument  but would have no impact on interest expense paid or recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as the loan bears a fixed interest rate 
variable rate debt 
our ubs credit facility and svb credit facility both bear interest at variable rates  based on spreads over libor and prime  respectively 
as of december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt outstanding under the ubs credit facility and nothing drawn under the svb credit facility 
a change in average interest rates would not have had a significant effect on net interest expense during  as there were no balances outstanding under the svb credit facility and any change in interest rates impacting the ubs credit facility would be largely offset by changes to interest income received on the ars investments 
as of december   the carrying value of our variable rate debt instruments approximated fair value 
on january   subsequent to the end of  we exercised our rights to put those ars investments back to ubs at par value 
we received net cash proceeds of million after selling our million ars investment to ubs and liquidating our million in advances under the ubs credit facility 
we no longer have any investments in ars or debt with ubs following this transaction 
foreign currency risk 
our revenues from international customers and our inventory costs from international suppliers are exposed to the potentially adverse effects of currency exchange rates  local economic conditions  political instability and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
to the extent that our revenues and purchases from international business partners increase in the future  our exposure to changes in foreign economic conditions and currency fluctuations will increase 
our dependence on foreign customers and suppliers means  in part  that we are affected by changes in the relative value of the us dollar to foreign currencies  particularly the british pound  euro canadian dollar and taiwan dollar 
although our receipts from foreign customers and our purchases of foreign products are principally negotiated and paid for in us dollars  changes in the applicable currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of our customers and vendors 
this  in turn  might cause such vendors to demand higher prices  delay shipments  or discontinue selling to us 
this also might cause such customers to demand lower prices  delay or discontinue purchases of our products or demand other changes to the terms of our relationships 
these situations could in turn ultimately reduce our revenues or increase our costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculation  or trading purposes  or engage in any other hedging strategies with regard to our foreign currency risk
