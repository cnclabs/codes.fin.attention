item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s results of operations are dependent upon the difference between prices received for its oil and gas production and the costs to find and produce such oil and gas 
oil and gas prices have been and are expected in the future to be volatile and subject to fluctuations based on a number of factors beyond the control of the company 
the company operates the etame  avouma  south tchibala and ebouri fields on behalf of a consortium of five companies offshore of the republic of gabon 
production commenced from the etame field in and was subsequently expanded through additional development wells in and in  the company developed the avouma and south tchibala fields by setting a platform and tying the field back to the fpso via a pipeline 
oil production commenced from the avouma and south tchibala fields in january oil production began in january from the ebouri field utilizing a platform that was installed in august and connected to the fpso by pipeline 
impact of the current financial and credit markets the us and other world economies are currently in a recession which could last well into and beyond 
additionally  the financial and credit markets are undergoing unprecedented disruptions 
many financial institutions have liquidity concerns prompting intervention from governments 
the company s exposure to the disruptions in the financial markets includes the company s credit facility  ability to access the capital markets and investments exposure 
the company s credit facility extends through october and may be extended or converted into a term loan  at the company s option 
if the disruption in the financial markets continues for an extended period of time  replacement of the credit facility may be more expensive 
current market conditions also elevate concerns with the company s cash investments including funds in escrow  which at december  totaled million 
the company has reviewed the creditworthiness of the banks and financial institutions with which the company maintains investments as well as the securities underlying these investments 
with regard to the company s cash investments  the company invests in bankers acceptances and money market instruments primarily with jpmorgan chase co  which the company believes to be creditworthy 
the company s production in gabon is purchased by total oil trading sa  which the company believes to be a creditworthy purchaser 
oil and gas prices are also volatile as evidenced by the significant decline during and continued lower commodity prices will reduce the company s cash flows from operations 
critical accounting policies the following describes the critical accounting policies used by the company in reporting its financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting  such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below 
in those cases  the company s reported results of operations would be different should it employ an alternative accounting method 
successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities the sec prescribes in regulation s x the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in oil and gas producing activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements full cost method 
like many other oil and gas companies  the company has chosen to follow the successful efforts method 
management believes that this method is preferable  as the company has focused on exploration activities wherein there is risk associated with future success and as such earnings are best represented by attachment to the drilling operations of the company 
costs of successful wells  development dry holes and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production basis over the life of the related reserves 
other exploration costs  including geological and geophysical expenses applicable to undeveloped leasehold  leasehold expiration costs and delay rentals are expensed as incurred 
in accordance with accounting under successful efforts method of accounting  the company reviews proved oil and gas properties for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its oil and gas properties may not be recoverable 
when it is determined that an oil and gas property s estimated future net cash flows will not be sufficient to recover its carrying amount  an impairment charge must be recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
this may occur if a field contains lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field 
suspended well costs under the successful efforts method of accounting used by the company for its oil and gas exploration and development costs  all expenditures related to exploration  with the exception of costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of exploratory wells are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether commercially producible oil and gas reserves have been discovered 
if the determination is made that a well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities  the well costs are charged to expense 
these determinations are re evaluated quarterly 
for capitalized exploration drilling costs  if it is determined that a development plan is feasible  and the development plan is approved by the gabon government  costs associated with the exploratory wells will be transferred along with the costs spent on the development to wells  platforms and other production facilities at the time of first production 
the costs will subsequently be amortized on a unit of production based method over the life of the reserves as they are produced 
in the event it were determined that the discoveries are not commercial  the costs of the exploratory wells would be expensed 
for offshore exploratory discoveries  it is not unusual to have exploratory well costs remain suspended while additional appraisal and engineering work on the potential oil and gas field is performed and regulatory and government approvals are sought 
in gabon  the government must approve the commerciality of the reserves  assign a development area and approve a formal development plan prior to a field being developed 
on april   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fsp fas  which addressed a discussion that was ongoing within the oil industry regarding capitalization of costs of drilling exploratory wells 
paragraph of fasb statement no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies fasb no 
 requires costs of drilling exploratory wells to be capitalized pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if the well has found proved reserves  the capitalized costs become part of the entity s wells  equipment  and facilities 
if  however  the well has not found proved reserves  the capitalized costs of drilling the well are expensed 
questions arose in practice about the application of this guidance due to changes in oil and gas exploration processes and lifecycles 
the issue was whether there are circumstances that would permit the continued capitalization of exploratory well costs if reserves cannot be classified as proved within one year following the completion of drilling  other than when additional exploration wells are necessary to justify major capital expenditures and those wells are underway or firmly planned for the near future 
fsp fas amends fasb no 
to allow for the continued capitalization of suspended well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the enterprise is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the plan
