earnings overview following is an overview of the major fluctuations in the corporation s revenues and expenses in as compared to  and in as compared to more detailed information is provided later in management s discussion and analysis 
vs 
net income for the year ended december  was  or per diluted share  as compared to net income of  or per diluted share  in return on average equity was in and in return on average assets was in and in excluding realized gains and losses on available for sale securities discussed in the following paragraph  net of tax  and excluding the impact of reinvestment of proceeds from sales  net income per share was diluted in  as compared to diluted in pre tax losses from available for sale securities totaled  in  including impairment charges of  in contrast  pre tax gains from available for sale securities totaled  in securities losses in included the effects of other than temporary impairment charges on pooled trust preferred securities totaling  and bank stocks totaling  pooled trust preferred securities are long term instruments  mainly issued by banks  with or more companies included in each pool 
the impairment charges on pooled trust preferred securities resulted from management s assessment that it is unlikely some of the previously anticipated principal and interest will be received on four of the securities 
accordingly  management wrote down the cost basis of these securities to their estimated fair values as of december  after the impact of the impairment charges  c n s cost basis in pooled trust preferred securities totaled million  and the estimated fair value at december  was million 
other significant changes in the components of earnings for  as compared to  were as follows the interest margin was  or  higher in the improved interest margin includes the impact of the citizens bancorp  inc acquisition  which was effective may  the interest margin has also been positively impacted by lower market interest rates  which have reduced interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings  and by higher earnings on the investment portfolio resulting from higher average total holdings of securities 
noninterest income increased  or 
service charges on deposit accounts increased  or  as a result of growth in deposit volumes from the citizens bancorp acquisition  as well as higher fees associated with a new overdraft privilege program 
also  in  noninterest income included a gain of  from redemption of restricted shares of visa  resulting from visa s initial public offering 

table of contents vs 
net income was  in  down from  in net income per share basic and diluted was basic and diluted in and in return on average equity was in and in return on average assets was in and in annual earnings for were impacted by a substantial decline in realized gains from available for sale securities  as net pre tax gains totaled  in as compared to  in the lower net securities gains in reflect two significant factors management s decision in the second quarter to restructure the securities portfolio by selling mortgage backed securities for a realized loss of  with the proceeds reinvested at higher yields  and lower levels of realized gains from sales of bank stocks in  due to lower market valuations of financial stocks 
excluding gains and losses on sales of available for sale securities  net of tax  and excluding the impact of reinvestment of proceeds from sales  net income per share diluted was in  as compared to in on may   the acquisition of citizens bancorp  inc became effective 
citizens bancorp  inc was the parent company of citizens trust company  with offices in coudersport  port allegany and emporium  pa 
the citizens trust company operations  which are now part of c n bank  contributed significantly to growth in total assets  including loans  as well as growth in deposits and trust assets under management  and increases in revenues and expenses in in addition to the effects of lower net securities gains described above  other significant income statement changes between and were as follows the net interest margin increased  or  in as compared to most of the increase in the net interest margin between years occurred in the last six months of factors contributing to improvements in the net interest margin in included the acquisition of citizens trust company  which resulted in increased interest and fees on loans  and provided funding to help pay off borrowings  a change in the shape of the yield curve  which became positive after remaining flat or inverted throughout and the first half of  allowing the corporation opportunities to earn a positive spread from borrowing and investing activities  and the increase in yield on the investment portfolio resulting from the restructuring described above 
noninterest income  excluding realized gains on available for sale securities  increased  in over trust and financial management revenue increased  
assets under management by c n s trust and financial management group increased  to  at december  from  at december  the increase in trust assets under management resulted from the acquisition of citizens bancorp  inc  market value appreciation and new business 
there were also significant increases in other sources of noninterest revenue  including service charges on deposits and other revenues 
noninterest expense increased  in as compared to the increase in expenses reflects the addition of citizens trust company 
also  professional fees of  were incurred in related to the computer core system conversions of the first state bank new york and citizens trust company operations 
in  the income tax provision was  or of pre tax income 
in  the income tax provision was  or of pre tax income 
the higher income tax rate incurred in reflected management s decision to reduce the amount of average investments in municipal bonds  in an effort to eliminate alternative minimum tax 
outlook for as described in the earnings overview section above  net income for was slightly lower than in  primarily because of substantial securities write downs 
while the securities portfolio is a significant concern  management is optimistic about the expected impact on and future years of improvements made in core operations 
these improvements include the successful implementation of an overdraft privilege program  as well as other enhancements to noninterest revenue sources resulting from a profitability review conducted by a nationally recognized consulting firm in in addition to revenue enhancements  the consulting firm worked with management to identify improvements in efficiency of various operational activities  which have resulted in significant expense reductions 
the corporation experienced a net reduction in work force of  to full time equivalent employees at december  from at december  a major variable that affects the corporation s earnings is securities gains and losses 
in  the corporation reported realized losses from available for sale securities of  including the effect of pre tax write downs of impaired trust preferred securities by  and bank stocks by  the corporation s losses from trust preferred securities and bank 
table of contents stocks stem from the much publicized economic problems affecting the national and international economy  which have particularly hurt the banking industry 
although management believes these conditions to be cyclical  opportunities for realized gains from bank stocks are expected to be limited in  and after the effect of the write downs the corporation has significant unrealized losses on its available for sale securities as of december  management has reviewed its holdings of bank stocks  trust preferred securities and other securities as of december   and concluded that with the exception of the trust preferred securities and bank stocks that have been written down through earnings the remaining unrealized losses are considered temporary 
notes and to the consolidated financial statements provide more detail concerning the corporation s processes for evaluating securities for other than temporary impairment  and for valuation of trust preferred securities 
management will continue to closely monitor the status of impaired securities in the provision for loan losses in was  the provision was less than the corporation s average provision for loan losses over the year period ended december  of  during the last years  the highest annual provision was  in  and the lowest was  in issues related to larger commercial borrowers significantly affect the corporation s provision for loan losses in any particular period 
accordingly  the amount of loan loss provision for will depend substantially on the credit status of the commercial portfolio 
although management is concerned about the condition of the national economy and the potential for problems in our market area  to date the corporation has not experienced significant deterioration in loan delinquencies  or a noticeable change in volume of activity related to troubled debts or foreclosures 
the corporation has not originated interest only mortgages  loans without documentation of the borrowers sources of income or net worth  or other types of subprime mortgage loans that have received negative publicity in and if economic conditions deteriorate significantly in  the corporation may need to increase the provision for loan losses for the impact on the residential mortgage and consumer portions of the loan portfolio 
despite the operational improvements cited above  the corporation faces several factors that will negatively affect noninterest revenues and expenses in management expects total noninterest operating expenses to increase slightly in as compared to  mainly because fdic premiums are expected to increase approximately million  including a special assessment of approximately million and a recurring increase of million 
also  total noninterest revenue may be lower in than in in  noninterest income included a gain of  from redemption of visa shares  resulting from visa s initial public offering 
another source of revenue that is not expected to recur in is dividend income from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh restricted stock  which totaled  in the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh has announced that its final financial results may be affected by significant losses on its securities portfolio  and that it has discontinued paying dividends for the foreseeable future 
based on the information that has become publicly available through late february  management does not believe its investment in federal home loan bank of pittsburgh restricted stock of million to be impaired at december   however  management will monitor the situation for possible deterioration that could result in an impairment loss in in addition to these issues  the corporation s revenues from trust and financial management activities are expected to fall slightly in  because the market value of assets under management which is used as the basis for determining the amount of fees for most trust services has fallen as a result of the significant declines in us and international equity markets 
management estimates total capital purchases for to be approximately million  with computer software and hardware the largest planned categories of expenditure 
management has no current plans to acquire other financial institutions  or to build or acquire new branches in  but will evaluate opportunities that arise if they seem likely to contribute positively to future earnings and shareholder value 
although the corporation is well capitalized as described in more detail in the stockholders equity and capital adequacy section of management s discussion and analysis  current economic conditions are volatile 
accordingly  management and the corporation s board of directors decided to raise more capital by participating in the tarp capital purchase program 
management believes the additional capital raised through the tarp capital purchase program provides a form of protection that should allow the corporation to continue its normal lending and other operating activities  regardless of the possibility of securities losses  loan losses or other issues that could arise in the current economic environment 
on january   the corporation issued  shares of series a preferred stock preferred stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the corporation sold the preferred stock and warrant to the united states department of the treasury for an aggregate price of  in  the corporation will record issuance of the preferred stock and warrant as increases in stockholders equity 
the preferred stock and warrant qualify as tier capital for regulatory purposes 
a more complete description of the terms and conditions surrounding the tarp capital purchase program is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies the presentation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect many of the reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change is the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate and reasonable 
the corporation s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is described in a separate section later in management s discussion and analysis 
given the very subjective nature of identifying and valuing loan losses  it is likely that well informed individuals could make materially different assumptions  and could  therefore calculate a materially different allowance value 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
another material estimate is the calculation of fair values of the corporation s debt securities 
for most of the corporation s debt securities  the corporation receives estimated fair values of debt securities from an independent valuation service  or from brokers 
in developing fair values  the valuation service and the brokers use estimates of cash flows  based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar interest rate environments 
based on experience  management is aware that estimated fair values of debt securities tend to vary among brokers and other valuation services 
accordingly  when selling debt securities  management typically obtains price quotes from more than one source 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  in  the corporation changed its method of valuing pooled trust preferred securities from using price quotes received from pricing services  to a level as described in sfas no 
methodology  using discounted cash flows 
at december   management calculated the fair values of pooled trust preferred securities by applying discount rates to estimated cash flows for each security 
management estimated the cash flows expected to be received from each security  taking into account estimated levels of deferrals and defaults by the underlying issuers  and used discount rates considered reflective of a market participant s expectations regarding the extent of credit and liquidity risk inherent in the securities 
management s estimates of cash flows and discount rates used to calculate fair values of pooled trust preferred securities were based on sensitive assumptions  and use of different assumptions could result in calculations of fair values that would be substantially different than the amounts calculated by management 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment 
in making that evaluation  consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the corporation to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
management s estimates of cash flows used to evaluate other than temporary impairment of pooled trust preferred securities are based on sensitive assumptions  and use of different assumptions could produce different conclusions for each security 
also  management s assessments of the likelihood and potential for recovery in value of equity securities mainly  bank stocks are subjective  and based on sensitive assumptions 
net interest margin the corporation s primary source of operating income is represented by the net interest margin 
the net interest margin is equal to the difference between the amounts of interest income and interest expense 
tables i  ii and iii include information regarding the corporation s net interest margin in  and in each of these tables  the amounts of interest income earned on tax exempt securities and loans have been adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
accordingly  the net interest margin amounts presented in these tables exceed the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the discussion that follows is based on amounts in the tables 
in may  the corporation acquired citizens bancorp  inc included in this acquisition were all loans and deposits of citizens trust company  its banking subsidiary 
at the date of acquisition  the corporation recorded an increase of  in net loans and  in total deposits 
in december  management entered into a significant leveraged investment purchase transaction for two purposes to generate incremental positive net interest income  and to reduce the magnitude of the corporation s reduction in net interest income if interest rates rise significantly within the next few years 
specifically  the corporation purchased mortgage backed securities and a collateralized mortgage obligation for a total cost of approximately  which was funded mainly by two repurchase agreements borrowings of  each 
the weighted average initial book yield on the securities was 

table of contents the borrowings have a weighted average interest rate of  and mature in one of the borrowings is putable by the issuer at quarterly intervals starting in december  and the other is putable quarterly starting in december each of these borrowings contains an embedded cap  providing that on the quarterly anniversary of the transaction settlement date  if three month libor is higher than  the corporation s interest rate payable will decrease by twice the amount of the excess  down to a minimum rate of 
the embedded caps expire on the initial put dates in and three month libor did not exceed during  and the embedded caps did not provide any reduction to overall interest expense 
as of december   three month libor was 
if interest rates were to rise significantly during the lives of the embedded caps  the corporation s interest expense on the borrowings would decrease  which would be a mitigant to the corporation s overall liability sensitive interest rate risk position 
vs 
the fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was  in   higher than in as shown in table iii  net increases in volume had the effect of increasing net interest income  and interest rate changes had the effect of increasing net interest income  increases in volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities were significantly affected by the acquisition of citizens bancorp as well as the leveraged investment purchase discussed above 
the most significant components of the volume changes in were an increase of  in interest income attributable to growth in the securities portfolio  an increase in interest income of  attributable to loan growth  and an increase in interest expense of  attributable to growth in long term borrowings

at december   the amortized cost of the available for sale securities portfolio exceeded the estimated fair value by  in comparison  the amortized cost was  higher than fair value at december   and fair value exceeded amortized cost by  at december  as discussed in more detail in notes and to the financial statements  arm s length trading activity for pooled trust preferred securities came to a virtual halt in  and the corporation has adopted a level methodology as defined in sfas no 
 as amended for calculating fair values for these instruments 
based on its calculations  the corporation has recorded significant unrealized losses on its holdings of trust preferred securities as of december  also  many other categories of available for sale securities  for which the corporation determines fair value based on information provided by pricing services or broker quotes  have fallen in value in  including municipal bonds  equities and aaa rated private label mortgage backed securities 
in  the corporation reported realized losses from available for sale securities of  including the effect of other than temporary impairment write downs of trust preferred securities by  and bank stocks by  management has reviewed its holdings as of december   and concluded that with the exception of the trust preferred securities and bank stocks that have been written down through earnings the remaining unrealized losses are considered temporary 
notes and to the consolidated financial statements provide more detail concerning the corporation s processes for evaluating securities for other than temporary impairment  and for valuation of trust preferred securities 
management will continue to closely monitor the status of impaired securities in the balance of loans outstanding without consideration of the allowance for loan losses has grown  from the balance at december  to the total outstanding of  at december  of the total increase   came from balances acquired from citizens bancorp  inc and first state bank 
excluding the effects of acquisitions  total loans grew slightly in  fell slightly in  and grew in  and in loan volumes are heavily dependent on economic conditions in the corporation s market area  and are significantly influenced by interest rates 
overall  the corporation has experienced growth in commercial and consumer mortgage lending over the past years 
the corporation has not originated interest only mortgages  loans without documentation of the borrowers sources of income or net worth  or other types of exotic mortgage loans that have made headlines in recent months  and which have led some lenders and investors to realize significant losses from these types of instruments 
table viii presents loan maturity data as of november  the last date in for which the corporation ran the interest rate simulation model used to generate the loan maturities information included in table viii 
the interest rate simulation model classifies certain loans under different categories than they appear in table vii 
fixed rate loans are included in table viii based on their contractually scheduled principal repayments  while variable rate loans are included based on contractual principal repayments  with the remaining balance reflected in the table as of the date of the next change in rate 
table viii shows that approximately of the loan portfolio is fixed rate 
of the of the portfolio made up of variable rate loans  a significant portion will re price after more than one year 
variable rate loans re pricing after more than one year include significant amounts of residential and commercial real estate loans 
the corporation s substantial investment in long term  fixed rate loans and variable rate loans with extended periods until re pricing is one of the major concerns management attempts to address through interest rate risk management practices

the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio 
in evaluating collectability  management considers a number of factors  including the status of specific impaired loans  trends in historical loss experience  delinquency trends  credit concentrations  and economic conditions within the corporation s market area 
allowances for impaired loans are determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense  and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
there are two major components of the allowance statement of financial accounting standards sfas allowances on larger loans  mainly commercial purpose  determined on a loan by loan basis  and sfas allowances estimates of losses incurred on the remainder of the portfolio  determined based on collective evaluation of impairment for various categories of loans 
sfas allowances include a portion based on historical net charge off experience  and a portion based on evaluation of qualitative factors 
each quarter  management performs a detailed assessment of the allowance and provision for loan losses 
a management committee called the watch list committee performs this assessment 
quarterly  the watch list committee and the applicable lenders discuss each loan relationship under review  and reach a consensus on the appropriate sfas estimated loss amount for the quarter 
the watch list committee s focus is on ensuring that all pertinent facts have been considered  and that the sfas loss amounts are reasonable 
the assessment process includes review of certain loans reported on the watch list 
all loans  which lenders or the credit administration staff has assigned a risk rating of special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss  are included in the watch list 
the scope of loans evaluated individually for impairment sfas evaluation include all loan relationships greater than  for c n bank loans  and  for first state bank  for which there is at least one extension of credit graded special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
also  loan relationships less than  in the aggregate  but with an estimated loss of  or more  are individually evaluated for impairment 
in and  the banks risk management personnel performed annual  independent credit reviews of large credit 
table of contents relationships 
in prior years  outside consulting firms were retained to perform such functions 
management gives substantial consideration to the classifications and recommendations of the credit reviewers in determining the allowance for loan losses 
the sfas component of the allowance includes estimates of losses incurred on loans that have not been individually evaluated for impairment 
management uses loan categories included in the call report a quarterly report filed by fdic insured banks to identify categories of loans with similar risk characteristics  and multiplies the loan balances for each category as of each quarter end by two different factors to determine the sfas allowance amounts 
these two factors are based on historical net charge off experience  and qualitative factors 
the sum of the allowance amounts calculated for each risk category  including both the amount based on historical net charge off experience and the amount based on evaluation of qualitative factors  is equal to the total sfas component of the allowance 
the historical net charge off portion of the sfas allowance component is calculated by the accounting department as of the end of the applicable quarter 
for each loan classification category used in the call report  the accounting department multiplies the outstanding balance as of the quarter end excluding loans individually evaluated for impairment by the ratio of net charge offs to average quarterly loan balances for the previous three calendar years 
prior to the fourth quarter  c n bank had utilized the ratio of net charge offs to average balances over a five year period in calculating the historical loan loss experience portion of the allowance portfolio 
management made the change to the three year assumption  which had very little effect on the allowance valuation as of december   mainly because management believes net charge off experience over a year period may be more representative of losses existing in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
effective in the second quarter  management began to calculate the effects of specific qualitative factors criteria to determine a percentage increase or decrease in the sfas allowance  in relation to the historical net charge off percentage 
the qualitative factors analysis involves assessment of changes in factors affecting the portfolio  to provide for estimated differences between losses currently inherent in the portfolio and the amounts determined based on recent historical loss rates and from identification of losses on specific individual loans 
a management committee called the qualitative factors committee meets quarterly  near the end of the final month of each quarter 
the qualitative factors committee discusses several qualitative factors  including economic conditions  lending policies  changes in the portfolio  risk profile of the portfolio  competition and regulatory requirements  and other factors  with consideration given to how the factors affect three distinct parts of the loan portfolio commercial  mortgage and consumer 
during or soon after completion of the meeting  each member of the committee prepares an update to his or her recommended percentage adjustment for each qualitative factor  and average qualitative factor adjustments are calculated for commercial  mortgage and consumer loans 
the accounting department multiplies the outstanding balance as of the quarter end excluding loans individually evaluated for impairment by the applicable qualitative factor percentages  to determine the portion of the sfas allowance attributable to qualitative factors 
average qualitative factors used in calculating the sfas portion of the allowance did not change significantly by more than a few basis points for any category over the course of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses table table x includes the sfas component of the allowance on the line item called impaired loans 
sfas estimated losses  including both the portion determined based on historical net charge off results  as well as the portion based on management s assessment of qualitative factors  are allocated in table x to the applicable categories of commercial  consumer mortgage and consumer loans 
table x reflects a significant increase in the allowance on commercial loans to  at december  from  at december   mainly associated with an increase in the sfas allowance attributable to growth of the commercial sector 
in periods prior to  the portion of the allowance determined by management s subjective assessment of economic conditions and other factors which is now calculated using the qualitative factors criteria described above was reflected completely in the unallocated component of the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses was  at december   down from the balances of  at december  and  at december  as shown in table ix  net charge offs in of  were substantially higher by comparison than the recent historical levels of  in and  in the increase in net charge offs for included  attributed to four large commercial relationships that had been classified as impaired at december  table ix also shows the provision for loan losses totaled  in compared to  in and  in the total amount of the provision for loan losses for each year is determined based on the amount required to maintain an appropriate allowance in light of all of the factors described above 
table xi presents information related to past due and impaired loans 
as of december   total impaired loans amounted to  down from  at december    at december  and  at december  nonaccrual loans increased to  at december  compared to the  at december   though down from  at december  over the period  each period includes a few large commercial relationships that have required significant monitoring and workout efforts 
as a result  a limited number of relationships may significantly impact category fluctuations within table xi 
as of december   the sfas valuation allowance on impaired loans includes  related to two unrelated commercial relationships 
management believes it has been 
table of contents conservative in its decisions concerning identification of impaired loans  estimates of loss  and nonaccrual status  however  the actual losses realized from these relationships could vary materially from the allowances calculated as of december  management continues to closely monitor its commercial loan relationships for possible credit losses  and will adjust its estimates of loss and decisions concerning nonaccrual status  if appropriate

as reflected in note  at december  and  the ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average total assets are well in excess of regulatory capital requirements 
as described in the outlook for section of management s discussion and analysis  although the corporation is well capitalized  because current economic conditions are volatile  management and the corporation s board of directors decided to raise more capital by participating in the tarp capital purchase program 
management believes the additional capital raised through the tarp capital purchase program provides a form of protection that should allow the corporation to continue its

the difference between net income and comprehensive income is termed other comprehensive income loss 
comprehensive income or loss should not be construed to be a measure of net income 
for the corporation  other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax 
the amount of unrealized gains or losses reflected in comprehensive income may vary widely from period to period  depending on the financial markets as a whole and how the portfolio of available for sale securities is affected by interest rate movements 
beginning in  the change in accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to the impact of sfas no

in  mainly due to significant unrealized losses within the securities portfolio  there is a total comprehensive loss of  compared to the total comprehensive income of  in  and  in other comprehensive loss amounted to  in   in  and  in inflation the corporation is significantly affected by the federal reserve board s efforts to control inflation through changes in short term interest rates 
over the period through  the federal reserve increased the fed funds target rate times  from a low of to 
the fed funds target rate stayed at until august during that time period  long term interest rates did not increase as much as short term rates  which hurt the corporation s profitability by squeezing the net interest margin 
since august  in response to concerns about weakness in the us economy  the federal reserve has lowered the fed funds target rate several times  and in december took the unusual step of establishing a target range of to 
also  the federal reserve has injected liquidity into the nation s monetary system 
the combination of low short term interest rates and the federal reserve s efforts to inject liquidity into the monetary system has led some economists to predict net deflation in the us in the current low short term rate environment could  in the future  lead to inflationary pressures which would force the fed to change course and begin raising rates  which management would expect to be adverse to the corporation s cost of funds and net interest margin 
although management cannot predict future changes in the rates of inflation  management monitors the impact of economic trends  including any indicators of inflationary pressures  in managing interest rate and other financial risks

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices of the corporation s financial instruments 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  the corporation has significant unrealized losses on its holdings of trust preferred securities as of december  in addition to the effects of interest rates  the market prices of the corporation s debt securities within the available for sale securities portfolio are affected by fluctuations in the risk premiums amounts of spread over risk free rates demanded by investors 
management believes valuations of debt securities at december  have been negatively impacted by events affecting the overall credit markets during the last quarter of and all of there have been widespread disruptions to the normal operation of bond markets 
particularly with regard to trust preferred securities  trading volume has been limited and consisted almost entirely of sales by distressed sellers 
as a result  quoted market prices on many securities have been substantially depressed and the market for pooled trust preferred securities has become virtually nonexistent 
further  some banking companies that have issued trust preferred securities have elected to defer payment of interest on these obligations  and some issuers have defaulted 
management cannot control changes in market prices of securities based on fluctuations in the risk premiums demanded by investors  nor can management control the volume of deferrals or defaults by other entities on trust preferred securities 
however  management attempts to limit the risk that economic conditions would force the corporation to sell securities for realized losses by maintaining a strong capital position discussed in the stockholders equity and capital section of management s discussion and analysis and ample sources of liquidity discussed in the liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis 
the corporation s two major categories of market risk are interest rate risk and equity securities risk  which are discussed in the following sections 
interest rate risk business risk arising from changes in interest rates is an inherent factor in operating a bank 
the corporation s assets are predominantly long term  fixed rate loans and debt securities 
funding for these assets comes principally from shorter term deposits and borrowed funds 
accordingly  there is an inherent risk of lower future earnings or decline in fair value of the corporation s financial instruments when interest rates change 
the corporation uses a simulation model to calculate the potential effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity 
the consolidated information included in the table below was prepared based on data as of november  the consolidated information included in the table below was prepared based on data as of november   with pro forma adjustment to include the significant leveraged investment purchase transaction discussed below that occurred in december for purposes of these calculations  the market value of portfolio equity includes the fair values of financial instruments  such as securities  loans  deposits and borrowed funds  and the book values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities  such as premises and equipment and accrued expenses 
the model measures and projects potential changes in net interest income  and calculates the discounted present value of anticipated cash flows of financial instruments  assuming an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
management ordinarily runs a variety of scenarios within a range of plus or minus basis points of current rates 
the corporation s board of directors has established policy guidelines for acceptable levels of interest rate risk  based on an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
the policy provides limits at  and basis points from current rates for fluctuations in net interest income from the baseline flat rates one year scenario 
the policy also limits acceptable market value variances from the baseline values based on current rates 
as indicated in the table  the corporation is liability sensitive  and therefore net interest income and market value generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise 
the table shows that as of november   the changes in net interest income were within the policy limits in all scenarios  and changes in market value were within the policy limits in all scenarios except an immediate rate increase of basis points 
as of november   the changes in net interest income and market value were within the policy limits in all scenarios 
management reviewed the corporation s interest rate risk policy compliance with the board of directors quarterly during and management will continue to evaluate whether to make changes to asset and liability holdings in an effort to reduce exposure to rising interest rates 

table of contents in december  the corporation entered into repurchase agreements borrowings totaling million to fund the purchase of investment securities 
in addition to generating positive earnings from the spread of the return on the investment securities over the current cost of the borrowings  the transaction reduces the magnitude of the corporation s overall liability sensitive position 
specifically  the borrowings include embedded caps providing that  if month libor were to exceed  the interest rate payable on the repurchase agreements would fall  down to a minimum of  based on parameters included in the repurchase agreements 
the embedded cap on one of the million borrowings expires in december  and the embedded cap on the other million borrowing expires in december three month libor did not exceed during  and therefore  the embedded caps did not affect interest expense in when the interest rate risk simulation was run using november data  month libor was at 
since the embedded caps are effective only when month libor exceeds  the corporation would be unable to realize an interest expense reduction in the scenarios where current rates rise or basis points 
also  the realizable benefit in the scenario where rates rise basis points was substantially less than it had been at november the table that follows was prepared using the simulation model described above 
the model makes estimates  at each level of interest rate change  regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and call activity on other investment securities 
actual results could vary significantly from these estimates  which could result in significant differences in the calculations of projected changes in net interest margin and market value of portfolio equity 
also  the model does not make estimates related to changes in the composition of the deposit portfolio that could occur due to rate competition and the table does not necessarily reflect changes that management would make to realign the portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates

the corporation also owns some other stocks and mutual funds 
investments in bank stocks are subject to risk factors that affect the banking industry in general  including credit risk  competition from non bank entities  interest rate risk and other factors  which could result in a decline in market prices 
also  losses could occur in individual stocks held by the corporation because of specific circumstances related to each bank 
most us bank stock prices fell in value significantly during as discussed further in the earnings overview section of management s discussion and analysis  the corporation has recognized other than temporary impairment charges on bank stocks totaling  in table xvi shows that  after the effects of the other than temporary impairment write downs  the aggregate fair value of the corporation s equity securities is  lower than cost 
this net unrealized loss includes gross unrealized gains on stocks totaling  and gross unrealized losses on stocks totaling  table xvi presents quantitative data concerning the effects of a decline in fair value of the corporation s equity securities of or 
the data in table xvi does not reflect the effects of any appreciation in value that may occur  nor does it present the corporation s maximum exposure to loss on equity securities  which would be of their fair value as of december  at december   the corporation held stocks of banking corporations in unrealized loss positions  for which the aggregate cost exceeded the fair value by  or 
management evaluated financial and other publicly available information related to the individual banking corporations  and assessed whether that information indicates it to be probable the corporation will realize some portion of the unrealized loss on the impaired securities 
in conducting this analysis  management considered information related to the possibility of losses being realized in light of the corporation s financial condition and available sources of liquidity  and concluded the corporation has the ability to hold each banking corporation stock for a period long enough to allow the stock price to recover and the corporation to recover its investment 
also  as of december   the corporation has the intent to hold these stocks until their market prices increase to the extent the corporation will recover its investment 
based on the results of this analysis  as of december   management believes the impairment of the corporation s investments in stocks of banking corporations and other marketable equity securities to be temporary
