item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors 
see the cautionary note regarding forward looking statements set forth at the beginning of part i of the annual report on form k 
overview we are a mall based specialty retailer of action sports related apparel  footwear  equipment and accessories operating under the zumiez brand name 
as of january  we operated stores primarily located in shopping malls  giving us a presence in states 
our stores cater to young men and women between the ages of and who seek popular brands representing a lifestyle centered on activities that include skateboarding  surfing  snowboarding  bmx and motocross 
we support the action sports lifestyle and promote our brand through a multi faceted marketing approach that is designed to integrate our brand image with our customers activities and interests 
this approach  combined with our differentiated merchandising strategy  store design  comprehensive training programs and passionate employees  allows us to provide an experience for our customers that we believe is consistent with their attitudes  fashion tastes and identities and is otherwise unavailable in most malls 
fiscal a review of this past year fiscal was a difficult year for zumiez 
while the first half of the year was challenging  the second half of the year saw a marked deterioration in the us economy that negatively impacted our sales and financial results 
historically  we have made the majority of our profits in the second half of the year due to the seasonal nature of our business  so as the recession became more severe in the second half of fiscal  our sales and profits were proportionally worse 
as the economy worsened  we saw declines in traffic in our stores and more promotional activity from our competitors 
through the first six months of fiscal  our same store sales decreased and our diluted earnings per share declined or 
the second half of fiscal  the six months ended january   our same store sales declined and our diluted earnings per share declined or 

table of contents fiscal a look at the upcoming year we expect the upcoming fiscal year to be very challenging and believe it is difficult to predict the effects the unprecedented global financial and economic crises will have on our financial performance 
as mentioned above our results worsened as fiscal progressed and we believe our results will continue to be below those obtained in fiscal for at least the first six months of fiscal we are planning our business conservatively for fiscal  which includes lower purchases of inventory based on anticipated continued soft sales demand  lower capital expenditures due to fewer new stores and controlled selling  general and administrative expenditures 
our current forecast projects sustained working capital similar to previous years  adequate cash and investments  no borrowings on our credit facility and positive cash flow from operations 
we believe our earnings will be below fiscal if our same store sales decline 
our net sales increased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal  a compound annual growth rate of 
net sales for fiscal increased by million  or  over net sales for fiscal over the past five fiscal years ended january  we increased our store base from to and our comparable store net sales increased an average of per fiscal year 
as of january  we operated stores that averaged approximately  square feet per store 
we intend to expand our presence as a leading action sports lifestyle retailer by opening new stores and continuing to generate sales growth through improved store level productivity 
we have successfully and consistently implemented our store concept across a variety of mall classifications and geographic locations  and our strategy is to continue to open stores in both new and existing markets 
we plan to open approximately new stores in fiscal and to continue to open a significant number of new stores in future years 
unlike previous years  the number of anticipated store openings in fiscal may increase or decrease due to market conditions 
we have opened or acquired  on average  approximately twenty five percent new stores over each of the last five years 
as we look to fiscal and beyond  we will likely slow this rate of growth until we see the macroeconomic environment improve 
through our merchandising and marketing efforts  we have historically been successful in increasing the level of net sales in our existing stores and we will seek to continue such increases going forward 
we believe that we have developed an economically compelling store model 
our new stores opened during fiscal  generated average net sales of approximately million during their first full year of operations 
on average  our net capital investment to open these stores  was approximately  per store  which includes capital expenditures  net of landlord contributions 
however  net sales and other operating results for stores that we open or have opened subsequent to the end of fiscal  as well as our net capital investment to open those stores  may differ substantially from net sales and other operating results and our net capital investment for stores we opened in fiscal see business stores 
however our capital investment  net of landlord contributions  to open new stores and net sales generated by new stores vary significantly and depend on a number of factors  including the geographic location  type of mall and size of those stores 
accordingly  net sales and other operating results for stores that we open or have opened subsequent to the end of fiscal  as well as our net capital investment to open those stores  may differ substantially from net sales and other operating results and our net capital investment for the stores we opened in prior years 
we opened new stores in fiscal with an average net capital investment of approximately  per store  which includes capital expenditures  net of landlord contributions 
in addition to capital investments  we make working capital investments consisting primarily of merchandise inventory 
in any given period  our overall gross margin may be impacted by changes in the margins of the various products we offer as well as changes in the relative mix of revenues from the different categories of apparel and hardgood products that we sell 
over the past five fiscal years  our annual 
table of contents gross margin as a percentage of our net sales has ranged from a low of to a high of 
a number of other factors may positively or negatively impact our gross margins and results of operations  including  but not limited to general economic conditions and  in particular  the retail sales environment  actions by competitors or mall anchor tenants  the timing of new store openings and the relative proportion of our new stores to mature stores  whether we are able to successfully integrate any new stores that we acquire and the presence or absence of any unanticipated liabilities in connection therewith  fashion trends and changes in consumer preferences  calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods  timing of promotional events  weather conditions  the level of pre opening expenses associated with our new stores  and inventory shrinkage beyond our historical average rates  general net sales constitute gross sales net of returns 
net sales include our in store sales and our ecommerce sales  ecommerce shipping revenue and  accordingly  information in this report with respect to comparable store sales  includes our ecommerce sales 
for fiscal through fiscal  ecommerce sales represented approximately of our net sales and of net sales for fiscal we record the sale of gift cards as a current liability and recognize a sale when a customer redeems a gift card 
the amount of the gift card liability is determined taking into account our estimate of the portion of gift cards that will not be redeemed or recovered gift card breakage 
gift card breakage is recognized as revenue after months  at which time the likelihood of redemption is considered remote based on our historical redemption data 
we report comparable store sales based on net sales  and stores are included in our comparable store sales beginning on the first anniversary of their first day of operation 
changes in our comparable store sales between two periods are based on net sales of stores which were in operation during both of the two periods being compared and  if a store is included in the calculation of comparable store sales for only a portion of one of the two periods being compared  then that store is included in the calculation for only the comparable portion of the other period 
when additional square footage is added to a store that is included in comparable store sales  that store remains in comparable store sales 
there may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other apparel retailers calculate comparable or same store sales 
as a result  data herein regarding our comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors or other retailers 
cost of goods sold consists of the cost of merchandise sold to customers  inbound shipping costs  ecommerce shipping costs  distribution costs  depreciation on leasehold improvements at the distribution center  buying and merchandising costs and store occupancy costs 
this may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of goods sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of store personnel wages and benefits  administrative staff and infrastructure expenses  store supplies  depreciation on leasehold improvements at our home office and stores  facility expenses  and training  advertising and marketing costs 
credit card fees  insurance  public company expenses  sarbanes oxley compliance expenses  stock based compensation and other miscellaneous operating costs are also included in selling  general and 
table of contents administrative expenses 
this may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will  as described below  increase in future periods due in part to increased expenses associated with opening new stores 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to anticipate  identify and respond to the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demands 
any inability to provide appropriate merchandise in sufficient quantities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
key performance indicators our management evaluates the following items  which we consider key performance indicators  in assessing our performance comparable store sales 
comparable store sales provide a measure of sales growth for stores open at least one year over the comparable prior year period 
our management considers comparable store sales to be an important indicator of our current performance 
comparable store sales results are important to achieve leveraging of our costs  including store payroll  store supplies and rent 
comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash and working capital 
gross profit 
gross profit measures whether we are optimizing the price and inventory levels of our merchandise 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of branded merchandise costs  and our private label merchandise including design  sourcing  importing and inbound freight costs 
our cost of sales also includes markdowns  shrinkage  certain promotional costs and buying  store occupancy and warehousing costs 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups or any significant increase in our use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on our gross profit and results of operations 
operating income 
we view operating income as a key indicator of our success 
the key drivers of operating income are comparable store sales  gross profit  our ability to control selling  general and administrative expenses  and our level of capital expenditures affecting depreciation expense 
store productivity 
store productivity  including net sales per average square foot  average unit retail price  the number of transactions per store  the number of units sold per store and the number of units per transaction  is evaluated by our management in assessing our operational performance 
in addition  we review our stores operating income as a measure of their profitability

as a percentage of net sales  net income was in fiscal compared with in fiscal seasonality and quarterly results as is the case with many retailers of apparel and related merchandise  our business is subject to seasonal influences 
as a result  we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating results 
our net sales and operating results are typically lower in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year  while the winter holiday and back to school periods historically have accounted for the largest percentage of our annual net sales 
quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of store openings and the relative proportion of our new stores to mature stores  fashion trends and changes in consumer preferences  calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods  changes in merchandise mix  timing of promotional events  general economic conditions  competition and weather conditions 

table of contents the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated 
the unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein and includes all adjustments  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown 
this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
the operating results for any fiscal quarter are not indicative of the operating results for a full fiscal year or for any future period and there can be no assurance that any trend reflected in such results will continue in the future

comparable store sales percentage changes are calculated by comparing comparable store sales for the applicable fiscal quarter to comparable store sales for the same fiscal quarter in the prior fiscal year 
comparable store sales are based on net sales and stores are considered comparable beginning on the first anniversary of the first day of operations 
see general above for more information about how we compute comparable store sales 
liquidity and capital resources our primary uses of cash are for capital investments  inventory  store remodeling  store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements such as technology enhancements and distribution capabilities 
historically  our main sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations 
the significant components of our working capital are inventory and liquid assets such as cash  marketable securities and receivables  reduced by short term debt  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day or within several days of the related sale  while we typically have payment terms with our vendors 
as of january   we held two million auction rate securities valued at million  net of approximately million temporary impairment charge 
one of these million securities failed to sell at its scheduled auction in march in may  the remaining million security failed to sell at its scheduled auction 
the interest rates for these securities reset to a prescribed failure tax free rate of and  respectively 
we currently do not intend to hold these securities beyond their next auction date and will try to sell these securities when their auction dates come up in march and may however  uncertainties in the credit markets this fiscal year 
table of contents have prevented us and other investors from liquidating holdings of auction rate securities in recent auctions for these securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
if the march and may auctions fail  we plan to hold these securities until the next auction date and the securities coupon rate will reset to a prescribed failure rate 
unsuccessful auctions could result in our holding securities beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates if a secondary market does not develop  therefore  limiting the short term liquidity of these investments 
these securities have been reclassified from current to long term assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  our capital requirements include construction and fixture costs related to the opening of new stores and for remodeling expenditures for existing stores 
future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the pace of new store openings  the availability of suitable locations for new stores  and the nature of arrangements negotiated with landlords 
in that regard  our net investment to open a new store has varied significantly in the past due to a number of factors  including the geographic location and size of the new store  and is likely to vary significantly in the future 
during fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures  a majority of which will relate to leasehold improvements and fixtures for the new stores we plan to open in fiscal  and a smaller amount will relate to equipment  systems and improvements for our distribution center and support infrastructure 
however  there can be no assurance that the number of stores that we actually open in fiscal will not be different from the number of stores we plan to open  or that actual fiscal capital expenditures will not differ from this expected amount 
we expect cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash requirements for operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
beyond this time frame  if cash flows from operations  and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements  then we will be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future 
there can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available to us when we need it or  if available  that the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then current shareholders 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million from million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the change in the effect of the tax benefit from stock option exercises from to  partially offset by a decrease in net income 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the change was primarily due to an increase in net income  offset by an increase in inventory needed to support new stores and a decrease in trade accounts payable due to the timing of inventory receipts and associated payment in the fourth quarter 
in addition  fiscal cash flow provided by operating activities benefited due to parts of washington being declared a federal disaster area due to severe weather in the fourth quarter of fiscal in accordance with the presidential disaster area tax relief  we deferred our federal income tax payment of million from january to february this positively impacted fiscal s cash flow provided by operations and negatively impacted fiscal s cash flow provided by operations

we have a credit agreement with wells fargo hsbc trade bank  na the credit agreement provides us with a secured revolving credit facility until august  of up to million 
the secured revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of standby commercial letters of credit in an amount not to exceed million outstanding at any time and with a term not to exceed days  although the amount of borrowings available at any time under our secured revolving credit facility is reduced by the amount of standby letters of credit outstanding at that time 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the secured revolving credit facility at january  or february  the company had open letters of credit outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility of million at january  and approximately million at february  the secured revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates based on the lower of the prime rate at january  minus or the libor rate at january   plus for advances over  for a minimum of days and a maximum of days 
the credit agreement contains a number of restrictions and covenants that generally limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional debt  undergo a change in ownership and enter into certain transactions 
the credit agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain specified financial tests and ratios  including  a minimum net income after taxes of for any trailing twelve month period  a maximum total liabilities divided by tangible net worth of and a minimum quick asset ratio of our two most restrictive covenants are our quick asset ratio that essentially precludes us from borrowing to the extent we were to have no cash  marketable securities or accounts receivable and our net income covenant that requires us make at least in net income after taxes for any trailing twelve month period 
all of our personal property  including  among other things  our inventory  equipment and fixtures  has been pledged to secure our obligations under the credit agreement 
we must also provide financial information and statements to our lender 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at january  it is our intention to enter into a new credit agreement with a financially sound banking institution prior to the expiration of the existing agreement wells fargo hsbc trade bank  na contractual obligations and commercial commitments there was no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations during the fiscal year ended january  our operating lease obligations are not recognized as liabilities in the financial statements 
the following table summarizes the total amount of future payments due under certain of our contractual obligations and the amount of those payments due in future periods as of january  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations letters of credit we occupy our retail stores and combined home office and distribution center under operating leases generally with terms of five to ten years 
some of our leases have early cancellation clauses  
table of contents which permit the lease to be terminated by us if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods 
some leases contain renewal options for periods ranging from one to five years under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases 
in addition to future minimum lease payments  substantially all of our store leases provide for additional rental payments or percentage rent if sales at the respective stores exceed specified levels  as well as the payment of common area maintenance charges and real estate taxes 
amounts in the above table do not include percentage rent  common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes 
most of our lease agreements have defined escalating rent provisions  which we have straight lined over the term of the lease  including any lease renewals deemed to be probable 
for certain locations  we receive cash tenant allowances and we have reported these amounts as a deferred liability that is amortized to rent expense over the term of the lease  including any lease renewals deemed to be probable 
rent expense  including common area maintenance and other occupancy costs  was million  million and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
at january   we had outstanding purchase orders to acquire merchandise from vendors for approximately million 
we have an option to cancel these commitments with no notice prior to shipment 
at january   we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding 
off balance sheet obligations our only off balance sheet contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  related to operating lease obligations and letters of credit 
we have excluded these items from our balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we presently do not have any non cancelable purchase commitments 
at january  we had outstanding purchase orders to acquire merchandise from vendors for approximately million 
these purchases are expected to be financed by cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we have an option to cancel these commitments with no notice prior to shipment 
at january  we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our net sales or operating results for the past three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see discussion in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us  including information about contingencies  risk  and financial condition 
we believe  given current facts and circumstances that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable  inventory  fixed assets  prepaid assets  goodwill and certain liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
we believe our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas 
table of contents revenue recognition and sales returns reserve 
we recognize revenue upon purchase by customers at our retail store locations or upon shipment for orders placed through our website as both title and risk of loss have transferred 
revenue is not recorded on purchase of gift cards 
a current liability is recorded upon purchase  and revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 
revenue is recorded net of estimated and actual sales returns and deductions for coupon redemptions and other promotions 
the company records the sale of gift cards as a current liability and recognizes revenue when a customer redeems a gift card 
the amount of the gift card liability is determined taking into account our estimate of the portion of gift cards that will not be redeemed or recovered gift card breakage 
gift card breakage is recognized as revenue after months  at which time the likelihood of redemption is considered remote based on our historical redemption data 
we offer a return policy of days and the estimated sales return reserve is based on projected merchandise returns determined through the use of historical average return percentages 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve 
however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
valuation of merchandise inventories 
we carry our merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or market 
merchandise inventories may include items that have been written down to our best estimate of their net realizable value 
our decisions to write down our merchandise inventories are based on our current rate of sale  the age of the inventory and other factors 
actual final sales prices to our customers may be higher or lower than our estimated sales prices and could result in a fluctuation in gross margin 
these write downs may have a material adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
we estimate an inventory shrinkage reserve for anticipated losses for the period 
shrinkage refers to a reduction in inventory due to shoplifting  employee theft and paperwork errors 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve is calculated based on historical percentages and can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory shrinkage reserve 
however  if actual physical inventory losses differ significantly from our estimate  our operating results could be adversely affected 
impairment of leasehold improvements and equipment 
we review leasehold improvements and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual store discounted cash flow to the asset carrying values 
declines in projected store cash flow could result in the impairment of assets 
in fiscal we took a charge for leasehold improvement impairment of  based on projected performance of five stores 
if our sales and margins decline in fiscal and beyond additional impairment charges could occur 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculated leasehold improvements and equipment impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  our operating results could be adversely affected 
other than temporary impairment of investments 
we will record an investment impairment charge at the point we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
in determining whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred  we review information about the underlying investment that is publicly available such as analyst reports  applicable industry data and other pertinent information  and assess our ability to hold the security for the foreseeable future 
the investment would be written down to its current market value at the time 
table of contents the impairment is deemed to have occurred 
future adverse changes in market conditions  continued poor operating results of underlying investments or other factors could result in further losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  possibly requiring an additional impairment charge in the future 
any other than temporary impairment charge could materially affect our results of operations 
lease accounting 
the company occupies its retail stores and combined home office and distribution center under operating leases generally with terms of five to ten years 
some of these leases have early cancellation clauses  which permit the lease to be terminated if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods 
some leases contain renewal options for periods ranging from one to five years under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases 
most of the store leases require payment of a specified minimum rent  plus a contingent rent based on a percentage of the store s net sales in excess of a specified threshold 
most of the lease agreements have defined escalating rent provisions  which are straight lined over the term of the related lease  including any lease renewals deemed to be probable 
the company straight lines and recognizes its rent expense over the term of the lease  plus the construction period prior to occupancy of the retail location  using a mid month convention 
for certain locations  the company receives cash tenant allowances and has reported these amounts as a deferred liability which is amortized to rent expense over the term of the lease 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the financial statements  income taxes are estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we calculate income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires the use of the asset and liability method and involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income is assessed  recognizing that future taxable income may give rise to new deferred tax assets 
to the extent that future recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance would be established 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased  an expense will be included within the tax provision in the income statement 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
based on our history of operating earnings  no valuation allowance has been recorded as of january  in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  a valuation allowance may need to be established  which could impact our financial position and results of operations 
the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  on january  fin prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
under fin  a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits 
provisions for income taxes are based on numerous factors that are subject to audit by the internal revenue service and the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  under provisions of staff accounting bulletin n sab using the modified prospective method of transition 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  the estimated fair value of share based awards granted under the stock incentive plan is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 

table of contents to determine the fair value of our share based issuances  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to apply judgment and make assumptions to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them the expected term  the estimated volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term and an estimate of the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited 
we calculate a weighted average expected term using the simplified method under the provisions of sab the simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the vesting term and original contractual term of the options 
we use a historical volatility as we believe that this is representative of future stock price trends 
estimated forfeitures are calculated based on historical experience 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of our share based payments and the related amount recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
we recorded million of total stock based compensation expense for the year ended january  of which was attributable to the board of directors as required by the provisions of sfas no 
r 
the stock based compensation expense is calculated on an accelerated method for stock options and a straight line basis for restricted stock over the vesting periods of the related equity grant 
this charge had no impact on our reported cash flows 
at january  there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock awards of which was attributable to the board of directors 
this cost is expected to be recognized on a weighted average basis over a period of approximately three to eight years 
we account for unvested stock based employee compensation arrangements granted prior to our initial public offering on the intrinsic value method as allowed by sfas r 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change to suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations 
if the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment 
we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows of reporting units 
forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated and compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization 
during times of volatility  significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longer term trend

acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  non controlling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are susceptible to market value fluctuations with regard to our short term investments 
however  due to the relatively short maturity period of those investments and our intention and ability to hold those investments until maturity  the risk of material market value fluctuations is not expected to be significant 
during different times of the year  due to the seasonality of our business  we may borrow under our revolving credit facility 
to the extent we borrow under our revolving credit facility  which bears interests at floating rates based either on the prime rate or libor  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
at january  we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments 
fluctuations in interest rates did not have a material effect on the results of operations in fiscal interest rate risk our earnings are affected by changes in market interest rates as a result of our short term and long term investments in tax exempt us treasuries  municipal bonds  taxable agency bonds  and auction rate securities  which have long term contractual maturities but feature variable interest rates that reset at short term intervals 
we also invest in long term agency bonds 
if our current portfolio average yield rate decreases by in fiscal  our income before taxes will decrease by approximately million 
our current expectation is that our investment yields will be lower in due to historically low interest rates 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical yield rates on our cash  short term and long term investment balances 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall investments that could happen in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our investments structure
