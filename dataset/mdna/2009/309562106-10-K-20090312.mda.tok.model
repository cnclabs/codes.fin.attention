it had total assets of million at december  lending a significant part of the company s operating activities include originating loans  approximately of which are secured by real estate at december  real estate lending primarily includes loans secured by non owner and owner occupied one to four family residential properties as well as commercial real estate mortgage loans to developers and owners of other commercial real estate 
real estate lending primarily includes both variable and adjustable rate products 
loan rates on variable rate loans generally adjust upward or downward immediately based on changes in the loan s index  normally prime rate as published in the wall street journal 
rates on adjustable rate loans move upward or downward after an initial fixed term of normally one  three  or five years 
rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans are made annually after the initial fixed term expires and are indexed primarily to shorter term treasury indexes 
generally  variable and adjustable rate loans contain provisions that cap the amount of interest rate increases over the life of the loan of up to basis points and lifetime floors of basis points 
in addition to the lifetime caps and floors on rate adjustments  loans secured by residential real estate typically contain provisions that limit annual increases at a maximum of basis points 
there is typically no annual limit applied to loans secured by commercial real estate 
the company also makes fixed rate commercial real estate loans to a lesser extent with repayment terms generally not exceeding months 
the company s subsidiary banks make first and second residential mortgage loans secured by real estate not to exceed loan to value without seeking third party guarantees 
commercial real estate loans are made primarily to small and mid sized businesses  secured by real estate not exceeding loan to value 
other commercial loans are asset based loans secured by equipment and lines of credit secured by receivables and include lending across a diverse range of business types 
commercial lending and real estate construction lending  including commercial leasing  generally includes a higher degree of credit risk than other loans  such as residential mortgage loans 
commercial loans  like other loans  are evaluated at the time of approval to determine the adequacy of repayment sources and collateral requirements 
collateral requirements vary to some degree among borrowers and depend on the borrower s financial strength  the terms and amount of the loan  and collateral available to secure the loan 
credit risk results from the decreased ability or willingness to pay by a borrower 
credit risk also results when a liquidation of collateral occurs and there is a shortfall in collateral value as compared to a loans outstanding balance 
for construction loans  inaccurate initial estimates of a project s costs and the property s completed value could weaken the company s position and lead to the property having a value that is insufficient to satisfy full payment of the amount of funds advanced for the property 
secured and unsecured consumer loans generally are made for automobiles  boats  and other motor vehicles 
in most cases loans are restricted to the subsidiaries general market area 
supervision and regulation the company and its subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation that affect virtually all aspects of their operations 
these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors and borrowers and  to a lesser extent  stockholders 
changes in applicable laws  regulations  or in the policies of banking and other government regulators may have a material adverse effect on our current or future business 
the following summarizes certain of the more important aspects of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions 
supervisory authorities the company is a financial holding company  registered with and regulated by the federal reserve board frb 
all five of its subsidiary banks are kentucky state chartered banks 
three of the company s subsidiary banks are members of their regional federal reserve bank 
the company and its subsidiary banks are subject to supervision  regulation and examination by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the kentucky office of financial institutions kentucky office 
the regulatory authorities routinely examine the company and its subsidiary banks to monitor their compliance with laws and regulations  financial condition  adequacy of capital and reserves  quality and documentation of loans  payment of dividends  adequacy of systems and controls  credit underwriting and asset liability management  and the establishment of branches 
the company and its subsidiary banks are required to file regular reports with the frb  the fdic and the kentucky office  as applicable 
capital the frb  the fdic  and the kentucky office require the company and its subsidiary banks to meet certain ratios of capital to assets in order to conduct their activities 
to be well capitalized  the institutions must generally maintain a total capital ratio of or greater  a tier capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or better 
for the purposes of these tests  tier capital consists of common equity and related surplus  retained earnings  and a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock  less goodwill net of certain deferred tax liabilities and certain core deposit intangibles 
tier capital consists of non qualifying preferred stock  certain types of debt and a limited amount of other items 
total capital is the sum of tier and tier capital 
in measuring the adequacy of capital  assets are generally weighted for risk 
certain assets  such as cash and us government securities  have a zero risk weighting 
others  such as commercial and consumer loans  have a risk weighting 
risk weightings are also assigned for off balance sheet items such as loan commitments 
the various items are multiplied by the appropriate risk weighting to determine risk adjusted assets for the capital calculations 
for the leverage ratio mentioned above  assets are not risk weighted 
if the institution fails to remain well capitalized  it will be subject to a series of restrictions that increase as the capital condition worsens 
for instance  federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution  including the payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company  if the depository institution would be undercapitalized as a result 
undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the fdic  are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan for approval  which must be guaranteed by the institution s parent holding company 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets  and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
all of the company s subsidiary banks exceed the minimum tier  total capital and leverage ratios and qualify as well capitalized under current regulatory criteria 
expansion and activity limitations with prior regulatory approval  the company may acquire other banks or bank holding companies and its subsidiaries may merge with other banks 
acquisitions of banks located in other states may be subject to certain deposit percentage  age or other restrictions 
in addition  as a financial holding company  the company and its subsidiaries are permitted to acquire or engage in activities such as insurance underwriting  securities underwriting and distribution  travel agency activities  broad insurance agency activities  merchant banking  and other activities that the frb determines to be financial in nature or complementary to these activities 
the company has subsidiaries that engage in some of these additional activities  including insurance underwriting and distribution and other activities that are financial in nature 
the frb normally requires some form of notice or application to engage in or acquire companies engaged in such activities 
under the bank holding company act and gramm leach bliley act  the company is generally prohibited from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than of the voting shares of any company engaged in activities other than those referred to above 
limitations on acquisitions of bank holding companies as a general proposition  other companies seeking to acquire control of a financial holding company such as the company would require the approval of the frb under the bank holding company act 
in addition  individuals or groups of individuals seeking to acquire control of a financial holding company such as the company would need to file a prior notice with the frb which the frb may disapprove under certain circumstances under the change in bank control act 
control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company 
control may exist under the change in bank control act if the individual or company acquires or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company and no shareholder holds a larger percentage of the subject class of voting securities 
deposit insurance all of the company s subsidiary banks are members of the fdic  and their deposits are insured by the fdic s deposit insurance fund up to the amount permitted by law 
the company s subsidiary banks are thus subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments 
the fdic utilizes a risk based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank s capital level and supervisory rating 
under the federal deposit insurance reform act of  which became law in  the company received a one time assessment credit of million that can be applied against future premiums  subject to certain limitations 
based on the one time assessment credit  the company was not required to pay any deposit insurance premiums in and unused credits from limited the amount of deposit insurance premiums to thousand for lower credits remained to offset assessments for  which was the primary factor in higher deposit insurance net assessments of million 
financing corporation fico assessment costs were thousand for fico is a mixed ownership government corporation established by the competitive equality banking act of possessing assessment powers in addition to the fdic 
the fdic acts as a collection agent for fico  whose sole purpose was to function as a financing vehicle for the now defunct federal savings loan insurance corporation 
the company s participation in the fdic s transaction account guarantee program initiated during the fourth quarter of also contributed to an increase in deposit insurance premiums in the current period 
more information about this program can be found under the heading temporary liquidity guarantee program that follows 
during the fourth quarter of the fdic increased the deposit insurance from generally thousand for each separately insured depositor to thousand effective until december  in february  the fdic adopted a long term deposit insurance fund dif restoration plan as well as an additional emergency assessment for the restoration plan increases base assessment rates for banks in all risk categories with the goal of raising the dif reserve ratio from its current 
to within seven years 
banks in the best risk category  which include the company s subsidiary banks  will pay initial base rates ranging from to basis points of assessable deposits beginning april   up from the initial base rate range of to basis points 
additionally  the fdic approved an interim rule imposing a special emergency assessment to all financial institutions of basis points of insured deposits as of june  the interim rule is subject to a day comment period and in early march a proposal was introduced in congress to lower the special emergency assessment to basis points from the initial basis points 
the special emergency assessment is estimated to be million for the company as currently adopted under the basis point rule and will be collected on september  the amount of the special emergency assessment would decrease to million if the basis point scenario is adopted 
the fdic is also permitted to impose an emergency special assessment after june  of up to basis points if necessary to maintain public confidence in federal deposit insurance 
the increase in assessments by the fdic could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings 
other statutes and regulations the company and its subsidiary banks are subject to a myriad of other statutes and regulations affecting their activities 
some of the more important are anti money laundering 
financial institutions are required to establish anti money laundering programs that must include the development of internal policies  procedures  and controls  the designation of a compliance officer  an ongoing employee training program  and an independent audit function to test the performance of the programs 
the company and its subsidiary banks are also subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and know your customer standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers

recent laws provide the law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks 
sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
the company s subsidiary banks are limited in their ability to lend funds or engage in transactions with the company or other non bank affiliates of the company  and all transactions must be on an arms length basis and on terms at least as favorable to the subsidiary bank as prevailing at the time for transactions with unaffiliated companies 
dividends 
the parent company s principal source of cash flow  including cash flow to pay dividends to its shareholders  is the dividends that it receives from its subsidiary banks 
statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the subsidiary banks payments of dividends to the parent company as well as to the parent company s payment of dividends to its shareholders 
a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized 
the federal banking agencies may prevent the payment of a dividend if they determine that the payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
moreover  the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that financial holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings 
participation in the capital purchase program cpp beginning in the first quarter of includes certain restrictions on the company s ability to pay dividends to its common shareholders 
the company is unable to declare dividend payments on shares of its common stock if it is in arrears on the dividends on its series a preferred stock issued in connection with its participation in the cpp 
additionally  until january  the company must have approval from the us treasury treasury before it can increase dividends on its common stock above the last quarterly cash dividend per share it declared prior to october   which was

before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the company s business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the market price of the company s common stock could decline significantly  and shareholders could lose all or part of their investment 
the current economic environment exposes the company to higher credit losses and expenses and may result in lower earnings or increase the likelihood of losses although the company remains well capitalized  it is operating in a very challenging and uncertain economic environment 
financial institutions  including the company  are being adversely effected by harsh economic conditions that have impacted not only local markets  but on a national and global scale 
substantial deterioration in real estate and other financial markets have and may continue to adversely impact the company s financial performance 
continuing declines in real estate values and home sales volumes  along with job losses and other economic stresses can decrease the value of collateral securing loans extended to borrowers  particularly that of real estate loans 
lower values of real estate securing loans may make it more difficult for the company to recover amounts it is owed in event of default by a borrower 
the current economic conditions may result in a higher degree of financial stress on the company s borrowers and their customers which could impair the company s ability to collect payments on loans  potentially increasing loan delinquencies  nonperforming assets  foreclosures  and higher losses 
current market forces have and may in the future cause the value of investment securities or other assets held by the company to deteriorate  resulting in impairment charges  higher losses  and lower regulatory capital levels 
current levels of market volatility are unprecedented which could adversely impact the company s results of operations  liquidity position  and access to additional capital the capital and credit markets have experienced heavy volatility and disruptions during the current year  with unprecedented levels of volatility and disruptions taking place over the last few months 
in some cases  markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
if current market disruptions and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience a material adverse effect on its results of operations and liquidity position or on its ability to access additional capital 
there can be no assurance that recently enacted legislation and regulatory initiatives will help stabilize the us financial system eesa was signed into law by the president on october  as a measure to stabilize and provide liquidity to the us financial markets 
this legislation provides broad authority to the us treasury to invest directly in qualifying financial institutions  increase fdic deposit insurance coverage to thousand for interest bearing accounts  and other significant regulatory authority designed to strengthen us financial markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that any of the recently enacted legislation or regulatory initiatives or the company s participation in such programs will have the desired effect 
the failure of eesa  fdic  or other us government initiatives to stabilize the us financial system and a continuing or worsening of financial market conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company results of operations  financial condition  or access to credit 
risks associated with unpredictable economic and political conditions may be amplified as a result of limited market area commercial banks and other financial institutions  including the company  are affected by economic and political conditions  both domestic and international  and by governmental monetary policies 
conditions such as inflation  value of the dollar  recession  unemployment  high interest rates  short money supply  scarce natural resources  international disorders  terrorism and other factors beyond the company s control may adversely affect profitability 
in addition  almost all of the company s primary business area is located in central and northern kentucky 
a significant downturn in this regional economy may result in  among other things  deterioration in the company s credit quality or a reduced demand for credit and may harm the financial stability of the company s customers 
due to the company s regional market area  these negative conditions may have a more noticeable affect on the company than would be experienced by an institution with a larger  more diverse market area

treasury s capital purchase program restricts the company s ability to declare or pay dividends and repurchase company stock on january   the company sold directly to the treasury for the aggregate consideration of million  shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a  no par value and liquidation preference  per share the series a preferred stock and a warrant the warrant to purchase  shares of company common stock 
the securities were issued pursuant to a letter agreement dated january  and the securities purchase agreement standard terms attached thereto between the company and the treasury collectively  the purchase agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  the company s ability to declare or pay dividends on any of its stock is limited 
specifically  the company is unable to declare dividend payments on shares of common or junior preferred stock if it is in arrears on the dividends on the series a preferred stock 
similarly  dividends on preferred stock that has the same liquidation and distribution preference as the series a preferred stock may only receive dividends pro rata with the series a preferred stock during any period in which dividends on the series a preferred stock are in arrears 
further  until january   the company must have the treasury s approval before it can increase dividends on its common stock above the amount of the last quarterly cash dividend per share the company declared prior to october  this restriction no longer applies if all the series a preferred stock has been redeemed by the company or transferred by the treasury 
in addition  the company s ability to repurchase its shares is restricted 
until january   the company generally must have the treasury s approval before it may repurchase any of its shares of common stock  unless all of the series a preferred stock has been redeemed by the company or transferred by the treasury 
the company s status as a holding company makes it dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations the company is a financial holding company operating in a highly regulated industry that conducts almost all of its operations through its subsidiaries 
the company does not have any significant assets other than cash  company owned life insurance and the stock of its subsidiaries 
ordinarily  the company depends primarily on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and obtain revenue 
the company s right to participate in any distribution of earnings or assets of its subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of creditors of such subsidiaries 
under federal and state law  the company s bank subsidiaries are limited in the amount of dividends they may pay to the company without prior regulatory approval 
also  bank regulators have the authority to prohibit the subsidiary banks from paying dividends if the bank regulators determine the payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
however  due to its participation in the cpp the company does not anticipate collecting dividends from its bank subsidiaries during this will effectively increase capital at the bank subsidiary level as greater levels of earnings are retained 
interest rate volatility could significantly harm the company s business the company s results of operations are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the regulatory policies of governmental authorities 
a significant component of the company s earnings is its net interest income  which is the difference between the income from interest earning assets  such as loans  and the expense of interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits 
a change in market interest rates could adversely affect the company s earnings if market interest rates change such that the interest the company pays on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest they collect on loans and investments  or  alternatively  since current market interest rates are at historically low levels there is risk that interest rates earned on earning assets will decline faster than those rates paid on interest paying liabilities 
consequently  the company  along with other financial institutions generally  is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
in addition  it is increasingly common for competitors of the company to pay rates on deposits that are much higher than normal market rates in an effort to attract deposits as a result of increased liquidity concerns stemming from current economic conditions 
the company s results of operations are significantly affected by the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans lending money is an essential part of the banking business 
however  borrowers do not always repay their loans 
the risk of non payment is affected by unanticipated declines in borrower income or cash flow  changes in economic and industry conditions  the duration of the loan  and in the case of a collateralized loan  uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral 
due to the fact that the outstanding principal balances can be larger for commercial loans than other types of loans  such loans present a greater risk to the company than other types of loans when non payment by a borrower occurs 
in addition  consumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields compared to real estate mortgage loans  but generally carry higher risks of frequency of default than real estate mortgage and commercial loans 
consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans 
the company s financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected if its allowance for loan losses were not sufficient to absorb actual losses there is no precise method of predicting loan losses 
the company can give no assurance that the allowance for loan losses of its subsidiaries is or will be sufficient to absorb actual loan losses 
excess loan losses could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
each of the company s subsidiary banks attempts to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan losses to provide for estimated losses in its loan portfolio  but there are no guaranties actual future loan losses will not exceed these estimates and allowances 
each subsidiary bank of the company periodically determines the amount of its allowance for loan losses based upon consideration of several factors  including a regular review of the quality  mix and size of the overall loan portfolio  historical loan loss experience  evaluation of non performing loans  assessment of economic conditions and their effects on the bank s existing portfolio  and the amount and quality of collateral  including guarantees  securing loans 
combining a newly acquired bank or other business entity with the company s network of banks may be more difficult  costly or time consuming than expected the company has generally operated newly acquired banks as independent bank subsidiaries within the network of the company s existing banking subsidiaries 
combining newly acquired banks or other entities within this network usually involves converting certain data processing functions from their current format  changing some of the policies and procedures in place  and other integration issues 
it is possible that integration processes could result in the loss of key employees or disruption of each company s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards  procedures and policies that would adversely affect the company s ability to maintain relationships with clients and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of a merger 
if difficulties with the integration processes occur  we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect resulting from an acquisition 
as with any merger of banking institutions  there also may be business disruptions that cause a newly acquired bank to lose customers or cause customers to take their deposits out of the bank and move their business to other financial institutions 
inability to hire or retain certain key professionals  management and staff could adversely affect revenues and net income the company relies on key personnel to manage and operate its business  including major revenue generating functions such as its loan and deposit portfolios 
the loss of key staff may adversely affect the company s ability to maintain and manage these portfolios effectively  which could negatively affect our revenues 
in addition  loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses  which could cause a decrease in our net income 
the company s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented the company s management regularly reviews and updates its internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system of controls are met 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
trading volume in the company s common stock is less than that of other similar companies the company s common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq global select stock market 
however  the trading volume of the company s common stock is less than that of other similar companies 
an efficient public trading market is dependent upon the existence in the marketplace of willing buyers and willing sellers of the company s common stock at any given time 
this existence depends on individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the company has no control 
given the lower trading volume of the company s common stock  larger sales volumes of the company s common stock could cause the value of the company s common stock to decrease

application of critical accounting policies the company s audited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices applicable to the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in 
note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and accounting for business acquisitions to be the accounting areas that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio  as well as management s estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset group on the consolidated balance sheets 
additional information related to the allowance for loan losses that describes the methodology and risk factors can be found under the captions asset quality and nonperforming assets in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  as well as notes and of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r effective january   the company accounted for business acquisitions as purchases in accordance with sfas no 
under sfas no 
the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value 
the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair value of the net identifiable assets is allocated to goodwill 
the company engages third party appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
determining fair value of assets and liabilities requires many assumptions and estimates 
these estimates and assumptions are sometimes refined subsequent to the initial recording of the transaction with adjustments to goodwill as information is gathered and final appraisals are completed 
the changes in these estimates could impact the amount of tangible and intangible assets including goodwill and liabilities ultimately recorded on the company s balance sheet as a result of an acquisition  and could impact the company s operating results subsequent to such acquisition 
the company believes that its estimates have been materially accurate in the past 
executive level overview the company offers a variety of financial products and services at its banking locations in communities throughout central and northern kentucky 
the most significant products and services include consumer and commercial lending and leasing  receiving deposits  providing trust services  and offering other traditional banking products and services 
the primary goals of the company are to continually improve profitability and shareholder value  maintain a strong capital position  provide excellent service to our customers through our community banking structure  and to provide a challenging and rewarding work environment for our employees 
the company generates a significant amount of its revenue  cash flows  and net income from interest income and net interest income  respectively 
interest income is generated by earnings on the company s earning assets  primarily loans and investment securities 
net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on earning assets over the interest expense paid on amounts borrowed to support those earning assets 
interest expense is paid primarily on deposit accounts and other short and long term borrowing arrangements 
the ability to properly manage net interest income under changing market environments is crucial to the success of the company 
in assessing the company s financial performance in this report  the following items of note should be considered the overall economic environment that began to show signs of weakness during deteriorated significantly in  particularly in the third and fourth quarters 
financial markets experienced widespread illiquidity and unprecedented levels of volatility 
slower economic growth including negative gdp growth in the third and fourth quarters  declines in credit availability  lower consumer confidence  increasing unemployment rates  and lower corporate earnings all contributed to significant economic challenges for the company in as a result of the unprecedented market conditions  us government agencies  including the us department of treasury treasury  the federal reserve board  and others  has intervened by enacting broad legislation and regulatory initiatives attempting to stabilize the us financial system 
efforts include injecting hundreds of billions of dollars into banks and other financial services firms  lowering overnight targeted interest rates to near zero percent  increasing deposit insurance coverage  and guaranteeing certain debt  among other actions 
housing market declines  falling home prices  increasing foreclosures  and higher unemployment have negatively impacted the credit quality and certain collateral values of the company s real estate loan portfolio  particularly in real estate development 
this has resulted in higher nonperforming assets and charge offs and negatively impacted net interest margin 
extreme market conditions and its placement into conservatorship led to a million pre tax impairment charge during the third quarter of the company s aggregate investment in federal national mortgage association fannie and federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie  collectively referred to as gse s preferred stocks 
the company subsequently sold its entire gse holdings during the fourth quarter and recorded an additional thousand pre tax loss 
during the fourth quarter  the company received preliminary approval from the treasury to receive million of equity capital via the treasury s capital purchase program cpp 
participation in the cpp will increase the company s regulatory capital ratios  which are already in excess of the well capitalized category  by approximately basis points 
the transaction closed in the first quarter of results of operations the company reported net income of million or 
per share for the twelve months ended december   a decrease of million or per share compared to million or per share reported for the same twelve months a year earlier 
the results of the current year are driven mainly by a million aggregate loss million after tax on the company s investments in preferred stock of fannie and freddie 
the company recorded a non cash other than temporary impairment otti charge of million related to the gse s in the third quarter following a sharp decline in value after the announcement that the gse s were suspending dividend payments and being placed into conservatorship by the federal housing finance agency 
the rating agencies also downgraded the preferred stocks of the gse s to below investment grade 
the company had million market value in gse preferred stock following the impairment charge at september  and subsequently sold its entire holdings during the fourth quarter for a loss of thousand 
other significant factors impacting net income in the yearly comparison include the following net interest income increased thousand or as a result of a thousand or decrease in interest expense that outpaced a thousand or 
decrease in interest income 
net interest income for was helped by an additional million attributed to the company s leverage transaction that occurred during the fourth quarter of the provision for loan losses increased million or as the company increased its allowance for loan losses as a result of continued credit deterioration 
the allowance for loan losses was of net loans at year end  up from a year earlier 
excluding investment securities related transactions  noninterest income was relatively flat at million for the current year compared to million a year earlier 
noninterest expenses increased million or 
lower salary and benefit expenses of million attributed mainly to lower benefit costs were offset by higher net other expenses of million 
higher expenses occurred across a broad range of line items  led by increases in fdic deposit insurance premiums and financing corporation fico assessments of thousand  higher net expenses related to properties acquired through foreclosure of thousand  and data processing and communication expenses of thousand 
income tax benefit was million for the current twelve months compared to income tax expense of million in the prior year 
the income tax benefit recorded in the current year is due mainly to the impact of the losses associated with the gse preferred stock investments in the third and fourth quarters of return on assets roa was 
in  a decrease of basis points from 
for the prior year end 
the otti write down and net interest margin contributed basis points and basis points  respectively to lower roa in the comparison 
these negative effects were partially offset by basis points lower noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets and a benefit of basis points attributed to income taxes 
the return on equity roe decreased basis points to compared to in the prior year 
the lower roe is mainly a result of the million or decline in net income that was influenced heavily by the otti write down 
interest income interest income results from interest earned on earning assets  which primarily include loans and investment securities 
interest income is affected by volume average balance  composition of earning assets  and the related rates earned on those assets 
total interest income for was million  a slight decrease of thousand or 
from the previous year driven primarily by lower average rates earned in a lower overall interest rate environment 
interest from investment securities was up million in the yearly comparison  nearly offsetting an interest decrease from loans of million or and temporary investments of million or 
the company s tax equivalent yield on earning assets for the current year was  a decrease of basis points compared to for the same period a year ago 
interest on taxable investment securities was million for  an increase of million or compared to million a year ago 
the increase is primarily driven by volume related to the company s million balance sheet leverage transaction that occurred during the fourth quarter of this transaction added million to interest income on taxable investment securities in the current year compared to million a year ago as the transaction occurred near the end of interest and fees earned on loans was million for  a decrease of million or compared to million a year earlier 
the decline in interest and fees on loans is due to a basis point lower average rate earned  which more than offset a million or rise in average loans outstanding in the comparable period 
new loans and variable rate loans adjusting during the current year have generally repriced downward as the average interest rate earned has declined 
the tax equivalent yield on loans was for compared to for interest expense interest expense results from incurring interest on interest bearing liabilities  which primarily include interest bearing deposits  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and other short and long term borrowed funds 
interest expense is affected by volume  composition of interest bearing liabilities  and the related rates paid on those liabilities 
total interest expense was million for  a decrease of thousand or compared to million for the prior year 
interest expense decreased mainly as a result of a lower average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in an overall lower interest rate environment 
interest expense on deposit accounts and short term borrowings declined million or and million or  respectively 
these declines offset higher interest expense related to long term borrowings of million 
the company s average cost of funds was for  a decrease of basis points from for the decrease in the average cost of funds was representative of rate declines throughout much of the deposit portfolio and borrowed funds 
the average rate paid on time deposits  the largest component of interest bearing liabilities  declined basis points to from a year earlier 
the million decrease in interest expense on deposits was led by a million or decrease related to time deposits 
interest expense on interest bearing demand and savings deposits were million or and million or lower in the current year compared to a year earlier 
overall  average interest bearing deposits increased million or  led by higher average time deposits of million or 
total interest expense on deposits decreased million mainly as a result of a basis point lower average rate paid on interest bearing deposits of for compared to for the basis point lower average rate paid on interest bearing deposits more than offset the million higher average balance outstanding 
the million decrease in interest expense on short term borrowings is due mainly to a lower average rate paid of basis points and  to a lesser degree  a million lower average balance outstanding 
interest expense on long term borrowings increased mainly due to the company s million balance sheet leverage transaction that occurred during the fourth quarter of this transaction added million to interest expense in  million of which is attributed to long term borrowings 
the transaction added million of total interest expense during the prior year as the transaction occurred near the end of net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of the company s earnings 
net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on earning assets over the interest paid for funds to support those assets 
the two most common metrics used to analyze net interest income are net interest spread and net interest margin 
net interest spread represents the difference between the yields on earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest margin will exceed net interest spread because of the existence of noninterest bearing sources of funds  principally demand deposits and shareholders equity  which are also available to fund earning assets 
changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction between the volume and the composition of earning assets  their related yields  and the associated cost and composition of the interest bearing liabilities 
accordingly  portfolio size  composition  and the related yields earned and the average rates paid can have a significant impact on net interest spread and margin 
the table on the following page represents the major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis 
to compare the tax exempt asset yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on the marginal corporate federal tax rate of tax equivalent net interest income was million for  an increase of thousand or compared to million for the net interest margin was  a decrease of basis points from in the prior year 
net interest spread accounted for basis points of the lower net interest margin and was for compared to a year earlier 
the impact of noninterest bearing sources of funds negatively impacted net interest margin by an additional basis points in the comparison 
the effect of noninterest bearing sources of funds on net interest margin typically decreases as the average cost of funds declines 
during  the company s tax equivalent yield on total earning assets was  down basis points from for the average cost of funds was  a decrease of basis points compared to for this resulted in a net interest spread of and for year ends and as indicated above 
although the overall yield on earning assets decreased more than the overall decrease in the average cost of funds  net interest income increased mainly because of the million leverage transaction the company entered into during the fourth quarter of the company remains proactive in management of the rate sensitive components of both its assets and liabilities in a volatile market environment 
this task continues to be challenging and has been even more difficult following the extreme market disruptions and economic downturn in competition in the company s market areas continues to be intense 
the overall interest rate environment remains low by historical measures 
after gradual increases in the targeted short term federal funds rate during and  the fed began lowering this rate toward the end of as weakening economic conditions began to mount and credit markets began to tighten 
the federal funds rate  which peaked during at  was dropped sharply near the beginning of and by year end stood at near zero percent 
the prime interest rate  which has a significant impact on the company s interest income on loans  moved in a manner similar to that of the federal funds rate 
the prime rate ended at  falling basis points from at year end predicting the movement of future interest rates is uncertain 
during  the average rates for two of the most significant components of net interest income for the company  loans and time deposits  both declined 
as previously noted  the average rate earned on the company s loan portfolio declined basis points to during the average rate paid on time deposits decreased basis points to in the year to year comparison 
should interest rates on the company s earning assets and interest paying liabilities reprice lower  the company s yield on earning assets could potentially decrease faster than its cost of funds 
should interest rates reprice higher  the company s cost of funds may also increase and could continue to increase faster than the yields on earning assets  resulting in a lower net interest margin

noninterest income noninterest income for was million  a decrease of million or compared to a year ago 
the decrease in noninterest income in the comparison was primarily the result of the million non cash otti charge related to the company s gse investments in the third quarter of and an additional thousand realized loss on the sale of its gse investments in the fourth quarter 
excluding securities related transactions  noninterest income was relatively flat at million for compared to million a year earlier 
other significant line item increases include higher allotment processing fees of thousand or and higher non deposit service charges  commissions  and fees of thousand or 
these amounts were offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts of thousand or  lower net gains on the sale of loans of thousand or  and lower data processing fees of thousand or 
allotment processing fees increased partially due to the timing of the acquisition of the military allotment operations of pnc bank during the first quarter a year ago and increased volumes 
the increase in non deposit service charges  commissions  and fees was due to higher volume related interchange and atm fees of thousand and thousand  respectively 
lower service charges and fees on deposits were driven by a decrease in dormant account fees of million  which offset higher overdraft charges of thousand 
the decrease in dormant account fees is related to a change in the dormant account policy of one of the company s subsidiary banks during the change in policy  which was phased in during the second and third quarters of  lengthened the period of transaction inactivity of deposit accounts required to consider them dormant 
the policy changed the dormant period of certain deposit accounts to months from six months 
this resulted in a decrease in the number of dormant accounts and the related fee income 
the decrease in net gains on sale of loans is attributed to lower loan sales volume in compared to a year ago 
data processing fees have declined as a result of lower processing volumes 
net investment securities losses of thousand include a thousand gain attributed to the mandatory redemption of part of the visa  inc common stock received during the first quarter of and thousand attributed to the reversal of previously accrued litigation 
the accrued litigation represented the company s share of the litigation reserve escrow account established by visa related to its ipo 
net securities losses also include the thousand loss realized on the sale of the company s gse holdings 
other investment securities transactions occurred in the normal course of asset and liability management 
noninterest expense total noninterest expenses were million for  up million or from million compared to salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of noninterest expenses  decreased million or although the average number of full time equivalent employees was relatively flat at compared to from a year earlier 
the decline in salary and employee benefits is attributed to lower employee benefit costs of million 
cost reduction include lower amounts attributed to the company s postretirement benefit plans of thousand  lower amounts for the company s matching contribution to its salary savings plan of thousand  and thousand lower other benefit expenses primarily associated with the company s self funded health insurance plan 
lower postretirement benefits costs for is mainly attributed to higher benefit expenses during related to an actuary error discovered in the actuary error  which was the result of using an incorrect actuary table  caused the amount recorded upon adoption of sfas no 
at december  to be incorrect 
this resulted in an immaterial amount of expense for to be recorded in the thousand decrease in expense related to the company s salary savings plan is attributed to a basis point reduction in the amount of funds the company matched in employee contributions to the salary savings plan 
in  the company made a discretionary contribution to the plan 
in  the company did not make a discretionary contribution to the plan 
a decrease in expense related to the company s self funded health insurance plan during compared to a year earlier was driven by an overall decline in medical and dental claims 
intangible amortization expense decreased thousand or 
amortization of intangible assets  which relate to customer lists and core deposits from prior acquisitions  is decreasing as a result of amortization schedules that allocate a higher amount of amortization in the earlier periods following an acquisition consistent with how the assets are used 
net occupancy expenses were million for  an increase of thousand or compared to million for the increase in net occupancy expense is due mainly to higher depreciation and utilities and correlates to additional properties used in the company s business 
data processing and communications expense increased thousand or in the current year primarily due to higher atm  debit card  and other transaction volumes 
correspondent bank fees increased thousand or due mainly to a change in billing method of an upstream correspondent bank in the current year 
the billing method included switching from the requirement to maintain a certain minimum balance with the correspondent to a set fee based structured arrangement 
other noninterest expenses were million  an increase of million or and were driven mainly by higher fdic deposit insurance and related fico assessments of thousand and net expenses associated with other real estate owned of thousand 
the increase in deposit insurance expense is mainly attributed to the expiration of a one time fdic insurance credit of million received during that reduced the company s net fdic insurance costs by a declining amount in each year since there are thousand in unused credits remaining at december  available to offset future assessments 
the increase in expenses related to other real estate owned corresponds to a higher outstanding balance for the current year and is also magnified as a result of an overall net gain attributed to other real estate in the prior year of thousand 
income tax the company recorded an income tax benefit for of million compared to income tax expense of million in the prior year 
the income tax benefit recorded in the current year is due mainly to the impact of the losses associated with the gse preferred stock investments in the third and fourth quarters of financial condition total assets were billion at december   an increase of million or from year end the most significant changes in the company s assets from the prior year end were a million or increase in cash and cash equivalents  an increase in loans net of allowance of million or  higher real estate acquired through foreclosure of million or  partially offset by lower investment securities of million or 
total liabilities increased million or at december  compared to the prior year end 
higher deposit balances account for million of the increase in liabilities and long term fhlb advances increased million or 
total shareholders equity was relatively unchanged in the annual comparison  remaining at million 
the increase in current end of period cash and cash equivalents compared to year end was driven by an additional million in deposits from the commonwealth of kentucky commonwealth 
increases from other sources of funds  including interest bearing deposits and net proceeds from matured  called  or sold investment securities  have generally been reinvested in temporary investments and loans 
the modest increase in net loans from year end is representative of a more cautious and measured lending strategy resulting from continuing general economic weaknesses and tighter loan underwriting standards 
management of the company considers it noteworthy to understand the relationship between the company s principal subsidiary  farmers bank  and the commonwealth 
farmers bank provides various services to state agencies of the commonwealth 
as the depository for the commonwealth  checks are drawn on farmers bank by these agencies  which include paychecks and state income tax refunds 
farmers bank also processes vouchers of the wic women  infants and children program for the cabinet for human resources 
the bank s investment department also provides services to the teacher s retirement system 
as the depository for the commonwealth  large fluctuations in deposits are likely to occur on a daily basis 
therefore  reviewing average balances is important to understanding the financial condition of the company 
on an average basis  total assets were billion for  an increase of million or from year end the increase in average assets is attributed mainly to higher earning asset balances 
average investment securities were up million  boosted by the million balance sheet leverage transaction that occurred during the fourth quarter of average loans were up million or compared to the average year end balance 
deposits averaged billion for  an increase of million or from average deposits from the commonwealth were relatively unchanged at million in the comparison 
average earning assets were of total average assets at december   a decrease of basis points compared to at year end loans loans  net of unearned income  totaled billion at december   up million or compared to year end the company continues to take a more measured and cautious approach to loan growth in the near term as a result of continued weaknesses in the general economy  including a softer housing market and significant credit tightening throughout the financial services industry 
loans secured by residential real estate and real estate construction loans were up million or and million or  respectively 
loan contractions occurred in the remaining sectors of the loan portfolio including other commercial lending of million or  consumer installment loans of million or  real estate lending secured by farmland and other commercial enterprises of million or  and lease financing of million or on average  loans represented of earning assets during compared to for the basis point decrease in the ratio of average loans to average earning assets is due mainly to the million balance sheet leverage transaction that occurred during the fourth quarter of the leverage transaction boosted the ratio of average taxable investment securities to average earning assets to for from a year earlier 
when loan demand declines  the available funds are redirected to lower earning temporary investments or investment securities  which typically involve a decrease in credit risk and lower yields 
the company does not have direct exposure to the subprime mortgage market 
the company does not originate subprime mortgages nor has it invested in bonds that are secured by such mortgages 
subprime mortgage lending is defined by the company generally as lending to a borrower that would not qualify for a mortgage loan at prevailing market rates or whereby the underwriting decision is based on limited or no documentation of the ability to repay 
the composition of the loan portfolio  net of unearned income  is summarized in the table below 
in thousands december  commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage residential real estate mortgage farmland and other commercial enterprises installment lease financing total the following table presents commercial  financial  and agricultural loans and real estate construction loans outstanding at december  which  based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal  are due in the periods indicated

interest sensitivity fixed variable in thousands rate rate due after one but within five years due after five years total asset quality the company s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated by diversification within the portfolio  limiting exposure to any single customer or industry  rigorous lending policies and underwriting criteria  and collateral requirements 
the company maintains policies and procedures to ensure that the granting of credit is done in a sound and consistent manner 
this includes policies on a company wide basis that require certain minimum standards to be maintained 
however  the policies also permit the individual subsidiary companies authority to adopt standards that are no less stringent than those included in the company wide policies 
credit decisions are made at the subsidiary bank level under guidelines established by policy 
the company s internal audit department performs loan reviews at each subsidiary bank during the year 
this loan review evaluates loan administration  credit quality  documentation  compliance with company loan standards  and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a consolidated and subsidiary basis 
the provision for loan losses represents charges made to earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses at an adequate level based on credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio  as well as management s best estimate of probable incurred loan losses in the remainder of the portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by net charge offs 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
management estimates the allowance balance required using a risk rated methodology 
many factors are considered when estimating the allowance 
these include  but are not limited to  past loan loss experience  an assessment of the financial condition of individual borrowers  a determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral  the condition of the local economy  an analysis of the levels and trends of the loan portfolio  and a review of delinquent and classified loans 
the allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current risk factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
actual loan losses could differ significantly from the amounts estimated by management 
the risk rated methodology includes segregating watch list and past due loans from the general portfolio and allocating specific reserves to these loans depending on their status 
for example  watch list loans  which may be identified by the internal loan review risk rating system or by regulatory examiner classification  are assigned a certain loss percentage while loans past due days or more are assigned a different loss percentage 
each of these percentages considers past experience as well as current factors 
the remainder of the general loan portfolio is segregated into three components having similar risk characteristics as follows commercial loans  consumer loans  and real estate loans 
each of these components is assigned a loss percentage based on their respective three year historical loss percentage 
additional allocations to the allowance may then be made for subjective factors  such as those mentioned above  as determined by senior managers who are knowledgeable about these matters 
during  the company further identified signs of deterioration in certain real estate development loans that continued into and specific allowances related to these loans were recorded 
while management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on the information currently available  additional adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in the factors noted above 
borrowers may experience difficulty in periods of economic deterioration  and the level of nonperforming loans  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require additional increases in the provision 
regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examinations  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
these reviews could result in additional adjustments to the provision based upon their judgments about relevant information available during their examination 
in general  the provision for loan losses and related allowance increases as the level of nonperforming and impaired loans  as a percentage of net loans outstanding  increases 
however  collateral values supporting nonperforming and impaired loans have generally been sufficient to more than cover the company s loan principal balance exposures 
the company s allowance for loan loss amount has heavily considered past loan loss experience to estimate current loan losses  but does consider current trends within the portfolio that may not be indicative of past charge off levels 
adjustments are made to the allowance for loan losses as needed when such matters are identified 
although beginning to trend upward  net charge offs during our three year look back period have been relatively low 
significant weaknesses in the general economy  particularly a softer housing market combined with significant credit tightening throughout the financial services industry began in overall economic conditions continued to worsen in  including widespread illiquidity and extreme volatility in financial markets  higher unemployment rates  and other unprecedented market conditions 
these economic conditions resulted in signs of stress primarily in the company s residential real estate development and commercial real estate sectors of its lending portfolio 
as such  the company increased its allowance amounts for real estate development and commercial real estate lending in consideration of these current factors  even though historic charge offs have been relatively low 
for loans that are currently impaired  defined as loans in which the company does not expect to receive full payment under the contractual terms  the company expects to recover significantly all of the principal amounts outstanding based on collateral values 
this has resulted in the amount of nonperforming and impaired loans that have increased at a faster rate than the related allowance 
impaired loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  at the loan s observable market price  or at the fair value of the collateral taking into consideration estimated costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent 
collateral values are updated as warranted by periodically obtaining independent third party appraisals and monitoring sales activity of similar properties in our market area 
the provision for loan losses was million in  an increase of million or compared to million for the steep increase in the provision for loan losses is reflective of higher levels of nonperforming loans  primarily nonaccrual loans that have trended upward as the overall economic environment has deteriorated 
nonperforming loans were million at december  compared to million at year end  an increase of million or 
a significant amount of the increase in nonperforming loans is limited to a small number of larger balance credits 
most of the million net increase in nonperforming loans is attributed to the addition of six individual larger balance nonaccrual credits of million  all of which is secured by real estate and more than offset amounts that are no longer classified as nonaccrual 
total net charge offs for the company were million for year end and were as follows commercial  financial  and agricultural loans million  real estate lending thousand  installment loans thousand 
lease financing had net recoveries of thousand in the comparison 
net charge offs increased million or compared to as follows commercial  financial  and agriculture thousand or  real estate lending thousand or  and installment loans thousand or 
net charge offs related to lease financing declined thousand in the comparison 
net charge offs in were driven by a relatively few number of larger balance credits 
net charge offs were

in and remain relatively low for the company 
the allowance for loan losses was million at year end and represented of loans net of unearned income at year end compared to at year end the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was and at year end and  respectively 
management continues to emphasize collection efforts and evaluation of risks within the portfolio 
the composition of the company s loan portfolio continues to be diverse with no significant concentration to any individual or industry

nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  and loans past due ninety days or more on which interest is still accruing 
generally  the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when it is determined that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful  or when a default of interest or principal has existed days or more  unless such loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
nonperforming assets totaled million at december   an increase of million or compared to million for nonperforming assets have trended upward mainly as a result of increasing economic pressures that continue to strain the company and many of its customers 
the increase in nonperforming assets is primarily due to net higher real estate acquired through foreclosure of million or and a million or increase in nonaccrual loans 
the increase in other real estate owned  which was million at year end  is due mainly to the company taking possession of three larger balance real estate developments totaling million previously serving as collateral for two separate extensions of credit 
the acquisition of these real estate developments combined with other smaller balance properties acquired more than offset the liquidation of significantly all other real estate properties previously held at december  the million other real estate owned referred to above was included in nonaccrual loans at the previous year end 
nonaccrual loans were million at december  compared to a year earlier 
the nine largest nonaccrual credits represent million of the total outstanding nonaccrual balances  million of which is secured by commercial real estate  million secured by real estate development properties  and the remaining million secured by other real estate 
three larger balance loans totaling million that were classified as nonaccrual loans at the prior year end were included in other real estate owned at december  the increase in newly classified nonaccrual loans in more than made up for this decline and is attributed to the downturn in the overall economic environment 
the amount of interest income lost was million related to the nine largest nonaccrual credits identified above with outstanding balances of million at year end the lost interest income reduced the yield on earning assets  net interest spread  and net interest margin by six basis points for nonperforming loans represent of loans net of unearned income at year end this represents an increase of basis points compared to at year end and is attributed to the higher nonaccrual loans as discussed above 
information pertaining to nonperforming loans and assets is presented in the table below 
december  in thousands loans accounted for on nonaccrual basis loans past due days or more and still accruing total nonperforming loans other real estate owned other foreclosed assets total nonperforming assets temporary investments temporary investments consist of interest bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
the company uses these funds in the management of liquidity and interest rate sensitivity 
at december   temporary investments were million  an increase of million compared to million at year end temporary investments averaged million during  a decrease of million or from the decrease is a result of the company s overall net funding position 
temporary investments are reallocated to loans or other investments as market conditions and company resources warrant 
investment securities the investment securities portfolio is comprised primarily of debt securities issued by us government sponsored agencies  mortgage backed securities  and tax exempt securities of states and political subdivisions 
during the first half of  the company purchased million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate preferred stocks of fannie and freddie 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded a non cash otti charge of million related to its investments in these gse s as a result of a sharp decline in the value of these investments 
this decline followed the announcement that the gse s were suspending dividend payments and being placed into conservatorship by the federal housing finance agency 
the rating agencies also downgraded the preferred stocks of the gse s to below investment grade 
the company had million market value in gse preferred stock following the impairment charge at september  and subsequently sold its entire holdings during the fourth quarter of for an additional loss of thousand 
the company also holds million amortized cost amounts of single issuer trust preferred capital securities of global and national financial services firms with an estimated fair value of million 
in addition  the company holds million amortized cost amounts of debentures issued by global and national financial services firms with an estimated fair value of million 
the company evaluates these securities under the applicable accounting guidance  sfas no 
 fsp no 
 fsp no 
 and sab no 
each of these securities currently are performing and rated as investment grade by the major rating agencies 
the company has the intent and ability to hold these securities for the foreseeable future and believes these securities are not impaired due to reasons of credit quality  but rather the unrealized losses are primarily attributed to general uncertainties in the financial markets and extraordinary market volatility 
the company currently believes that it will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of these securities and that the fair values of these securities will recover as they approach their maturity dates 
total investment securities were million on december   a decrease of million or compared to year end net amortized cost amounts declined million or  partially offset by a net increase in market values of million related to investments carried in the available for sale portfolio 
the decrease in the amortized cost amounts is attributed to the million otti charge related to the gse investments in the third quarter of combined with matured  sold  or called investments that exceeded new purchased amounts 
the million overall increase in market values of the available for sale investment securities is attributed mainly to the lower interest rate environment 
overall market interest rates decreased sharply throughout  particularly during the fourth quarter as reflected in the yield curves of the comparable periods 
market values of fixed rate investments are inversely related to changes in market interest rates 
unrealized losses within the company s investment securities portfolio at year end have not been included in income since they are identified as temporary 
the securities fair values are expected to recover as they approach their maturity dates and the company has the intent and ability to hold to recovery 
all investment securities in the company s portfolio are currently performing 
funds made available from sold  maturing or called bonds are redirected to fund higher yielding loan growth  reinvested to purchase additional investment securities  or otherwise employed to improve the composition of the balance sheet 
the purchase of nontaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions is one of the primary means of managing the company s tax position 
the impact of the alternative minimum tax related to the company s ability to acquire tax free obligations at an attractive yield is routinely monitored 
the company does not have direct exposure to the subprime mortgage market 
the company does not originate subprime mortgages nor has it invested in bonds that are secured by such mortgages 
the following table summarizes the carrying values of investment securities on december    and the investment securities are divided into available for sale and held to maturity securities

other short term borrowings consist of fhlb borrowings totaling million   and million at year end   and  respectively  and demand notes issued to the us treasury under the treasury tax and loan note option account totaling thousand  thousand  and thousand in   and respectively 
a summary of short term borrowings is as follows 
in thousands amount outstanding at year end maximum outstanding at any month end average outstanding weighted average rate at year end weighted average rate during the year long term borrowings the company s long term borrowings consist mainly of fhlb advances  subordinated notes payable to unconsolidated trusts  and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
fhlb advances to the company s subsidiary banks are secured by restricted holdings of fhlb stock that banks are required to own as well as certain mortgage loans as required by the fhlb 
such advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs  which have their own interest rates and range of maturities 
interest rates on fhlb advances are generally fixed and range between and  with a weighted average rate of  and remaining maturities of up to years 
approximately million of the total long term advances from the fhlb are convertible to a floating interest rate 
these advances may convert to a floating interest rate indexed to three month libor only if libor equals or exceeds 
at year end  the three month libor was 
fhlb advances are generally used to increase the company s lending activities and to aid the efforts of asset and liability management by utilizing various repayment options offered by the fhlb 
long term advances from the fhlb totaled million at december   an increase of million or from year end the company has previously completed three private offerings of trust preferred securities through three separate delaware statutory trusts the trusts sponsored by the company in the aggregate amount of million 
the combined million proceeds from the first two trusts trusts i and ii established in were used to fund the acquisition of citizens bancorp 
proceeds from the third trust trust iii were used primarily to acquire company shares through a tender offer during the company owns all of the common securities of each of the three trusts 
the trusts used the proceeds from the sale of preferred securities  plus capital of million contributed by the company to establish the trusts  to purchase the company s subordinated notes in amounts and bearing terms that parallel the amounts and terms of the respective preferred securities 
the subordinated notes of trusts i and ii mature in and bear a floating interest rate at current three month libor plus basis points on a million portion of the total and at current three month libor plus basis points on a million portion 
the subordinated notes of trust iii in the amount of million mature in and bear a fixed interest rate through of and then convert to floating thereafter at three month libor plus basis points 
interest on each of the notes is payable quarterly 
the subordinated notes of trusts i and ii are redeemable in whole or in part  without penalty  at the company s option on or after september  the subordinated notes of trust iii are redeemable in whole or in part  without penalty  at the company s option on or after november  the subordinated notes are junior in right of payment of all present and future senior indebtedness of the company 
at december   the aggregate balance of the subordinated notes payable to the trusts was million 
the average interest rate in effect as of the last determination date in was  a decrease of basis points compared to a year earlier 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent long term obligations whereby the company borrowed approximately million in multiple fixed rate repurchase agreements with an initial weighted average cost of 
the borrowings mature in various amounts and time periods as follows million in november  million in november  and million in november the borrowings have a weighted average remaining maturity of years 
at december  million of the borrowings are callable quarterly  million is callable quarterly during  and the remaining million is callable quarterly beginning in the company used the proceeds from the borrowing to purchase a like amount of fixed rate gnma bonds 
the gnma bonds have a current weighted average yield of and an estimated weighted average remaining life of years 
contractual obligations the company is contractually obligated to make payments as follows 
payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years time deposits long term fhlb debt subordinated notes payable long term securities sold under agreements to repurchase unfunded postretirement benefit obligations operating leases capital lease obligations total long term fhlb debt represents fhlb advances pursuant to several different credit programs 
long term fhlb debt  subordinated notes payable  and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are more fully described under the caption long term borrowings above and in note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
payments for borrowings in the table above do not include interest 
postretirement benefit obligations are actuarially determined and estimated based on various assumptions with payouts projected over the next years 
estimates can vary significantly each year due to changes in significant assumptions 
capital lease obligations represent amounts relating to the acquisition of data processing hardware and software 
operating leases include standard business equipment used in the company s day to day business as well as the lease of certain branch sites 
operating lease terms generally range from one to five years  with the ability to extend certain branch site leases at the company s option 
payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts 
guarantees during  the parent company entered into a guarantee agreement whereby it agreed to become unconditionally and irrevocably the guarantor of the obligations of its bank subsidiaries in connection with the million balance sheet leverage transaction 
the amount of borrowings outstanding guaranteed by the parent company at december  was million  with various maturity dates ranging from two to nine years 
the million outstanding borrowings are secured by gnma bonds held by the parent company s subsidiary banks valued at of the outstanding borrowings or million 
should any of the subsidiary banks default on its borrowings under the agreement  the gnma bonds securing the borrowings would be liquidated to satisfy amounts due 
if the value of the gnma bonds fall below the obligation under the contract  the parent company is obligated to cover any such shortfall in absence of the subsidiary banks ability to do so 
the parent company believes its subsidiary banks are fully capable of fulfilling their obligations under the borrowing arrangement and that the parent company will not be required to make any payments under the guarantee agreement 
effects of inflation the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the company differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other noninterest expense  which tends to rise during periods of general inflation 
market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk created by its core banking activities of extending loans and receiving deposits 
the company s success is largely dependent upon its ability to manage this risk 
interest rate risk is defined as the exposure of the company s net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
although the company manages other risks  such as credit and liquidity risk  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant risk  which could potentially have the largest and a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates earned on assets and paid on liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
other events that could have an adverse impact on the company s performance include changes in general economic and financial conditions  general movements in market interest rates  and changes in consumer preferences 
the company s primary purpose in managing interest rate risk is to effectively invest the company s capital and to manage and preserve the value created by its core banking business 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations 
the company has a corporate asset and liability management committee alco 
alco monitors the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity 
alco also provides guidance and support to each alco of the company s subsidiary banks and is responsible for monitoring risks on a company wide basis 
alco has established minimum standards in its asset and liability management policy that each subsidiary bank must adopt 
however  the subsidiary banks are permitted to deviate from these standards so long as the deviation is no less stringent than that of the corporate policy 
the company uses a simulation model as a tool to monitor and evaluate interest rate risk exposure 
the model is designed to measure the sensitivity of net interest income and net income to changing interest rates during the next twelve months 
forecasting net interest income and its sensitivity to changes in interest rates requires the company to make assumptions about the volume and characteristics of many attributes  including assumptions relating to the replacement of maturing earning assets and liabilities 
other assumptions include  but are not limited to  projected prepayments  projected new volume  and the predicted relationship between changes in market interest rates and changes in customer account balances 
these effects are combined with the company s estimate of the most likely rate environment to produce a forecast for the next twelve months 
the forecasted results are then compared to the effect of a gradual basis point increase and decrease in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and net income 
because assumptions are inherently uncertain  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or net income or the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net income 
actual results could differ significantly from simulated results 
at december   the model indicated that if rates were to gradually increase by basis points over the next twelve months  then net interest income te and net income would increase and  respectively  compared to forecasted results 
the model indicated that if rates were to gradually decrease by basis points over the next twelve months  then net interest income te and net income would decrease and  respectively  compared to forecasted results 
in the current relatively low interest rate environment  it is not practical or possible to reduce certain deposit rates by the same magnitude as rates on earning assets 
the average rate paid on some of the company s deposits is below 
this situation magnifies the model s predicted results when modeling a decrease in interest rates  as earning assets with higher yields have more of an opportunity to reprice at lower rates than lower rate deposits 
liquidity liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
for financial institutions  liquidity reflects the ability to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits  and to capitalize on interest rate market opportunities 
a financial institution s ability to meet its current financial obligations is dependent upon the structure of its balance sheet  its ability to liquidate assets  and its access to alternative sources of funds 
the company s goal is to meet its funding needs by maintaining a level of liquid funds through its asset liability management 
the company uses a liquidity ratio to help measure its ability to meet its cash flow needs 
this ratio is monitored by alco at both the bank level and on a consolidated basis 
the liquidity ratio is based on current and projected levels of sources and uses of funds 
this measure is useful in analyzing cash needs and formulating strategies to achieve desired results 
for example  a low liquidity ratio could indicate that the company s ability to fund loans might become more difficult 
a high liquidity ratio could indicate that the company may have a disproportionate amount of funds in low yielding assets  which is more likely to occur during periods of sluggish loan demand 
the company s liquidity position was slightly higher at year end compared to year end and remains within alco guidelines and considered by management to be at an adequate level 
at the parent company level  liquidity is primarily affected by the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary banks see 
note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements  cash balances maintained  and borrowings from nonaffiliated sources 
the parent company s primary uses of cash include the payment of dividends to its common shareholders  repurchasing its common stock  business acquisitions  interest expense on borrowings  and paying for general operating expenses 
the primary source of funds for the parent company is the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary banks 
as of december   combined retained earnings of the subsidiary banks were million  of which million was available for the payment of dividends to the parent company without obtaining prior approval from bank regulatory agencies 
as a practical matter  payment of future dividends is also subject to the maintenance of other capital ratio requirements 
management expects that in the aggregate  its subsidiary banks will continue to have the ability to dividend adequate funds to the parent company to meet its near term liquidity needs 
in addition  the parent company has a million unsecured line of credit with an unrelated financial institution available for general corporate purposes 
this line of credit matures in june and bears interest at the three month libor rate plus basis points 
the parent company had cash balances of million at year end  a decrease of million or from the prior year end 
significant cash receipts of the parent company during include million in dividends from its subsidiaries 
significant cash payments by the parent company during include million to purchase company common stock  million for the payment of dividends to shareholders  and million additional capital investments in subsidiaries 
each of the company s subsidiary banks continued to maintain well capitalized status as defined by the fdic subsequent to their dividend payments to the parent company 
the company s objective as it relates to liquidity is to ensure that its subsidiary banks have funds available to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability 
in order to maintain a proper level of liquidity  the subsidiary banks have several sources of funds available on a daily basis that can be used for liquidity purposes 
those sources of funds include the subsidiary banks core deposits  consisting of both business and nonbusiness deposits  cash flow generated by repayment of principal and interest on loans and investment securities  fhlb and other borrowings  and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are generally a predictable source of funds  deposit outflows and mortgage prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition in our local markets 
as of december   the company had million in additional borrowing capacity under various fhlb  federal funds  and other borrowing agreements 
however  there is no guarantee that these sources of funds will continue to be available to the company  or that current borrowings can be refinanced upon maturity  although the company is not aware of any events or uncertainties that are likely to cause a decrease in the company s liquidity from these sources 
for the longer term  the liquidity position is managed by balancing the maturity structure of the balance sheet 
this process allows for an orderly flow of funds over an extended period of time 
the company s alcos  both at the bank subsidiary level and on a consolidated basis  meets regularly and monitors the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity 
liquid assets consist of cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale investment securities 
at december   consolidated liquid assets were million  an increase of million or from year end the increase in liquid assets is mainly attributed to million higher cash and equivalents  partially offset by lower available for sale investment securities of million 
the increase in cash and equivalents is due mainly to higher deposit activity of the commonwealth and the overall funding position of the company  which changes as loan demand  deposit levels  and other sources and uses of funds fluctuate 
the decrease in available for sale investments securities was led by the million otti charge related to the gse investments during the third quarter coupled with matured  sold  or called investments that exceeded new purchased amounts 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  a decrease of million or compared to net cash used in investing activities was million for compared to million a year earlier 
the million improvement in cash flows is mainly due to investment securities transactions and loan activity 
net cash provided by securities transactions was million in the current year compared to net cash used of million primarily as a result of the million balance sheet leverage transaction in net loans originated for investment  a cash outflow  was million in compared to million a year earlier 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for  a decrease of million or compared to million for the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities is attributed to a million net decrease related to long term borrowings and a million reduction in company common stock purchases  partially offset by higher net additional funding from deposits of million 
the million lower net proceeds from long term borrowings in were mainly attributed to the million balance sheet leverage transaction that significantly increased borrowings in repurchases of company common stock were unusually high for as a result of share buy backs under the company s tender offer 
deposit growth for was attributed mainly to noninterest bearing deposits of the commonwealth 
deposits of the commonwealth grew million during compared to an overall decrease of million during during the fourth quarter  the company announced that it would participate in the treasury s voluntary cpp that was designed to inject billion directly into us financial institutions to build additional capital and encourage the flow of financing to us businesses and consumers in response to a weakening economy 
during january  the company completed its transaction and received a million cash equity investment from the treasury 
proceeds received by the company will be used to boost already strong capital levels and position it to seize upon organic growth opportunities by lending to well qualified individuals and businesses in our communities consistent with the intent of the treasury 
increased capital levels will also allow the company to better respond to the challenges and uncertainties of the harsh economic environment 
capital received under the cpp is viewed by the company to be a temporary bridge until the capital markets become more favorable to make a follow up public offering of its common or preferred stock 
information relating to off balance sheet arrangements is disclosed in note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
these transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of providing traditional banking services and are considered in managing the company s liquidity position 
the company does not expect these commitments to significantly affect the liquidity position in future periods 
the company has not entered into any contracts for financial derivative instruments such as futures  swaps  options  or similar instruments 
capital resources shareholders equity was million at december   virtually unchanged from december  retained earnings decreased million during and was driven by the non cash otti charge of million related to the company s gse investments in the third quarter 
an increase in other comprehensive income of million nearly offset the decline in retained earnings for accumulated other comprehensive income was up million due mainly to a higher net after tax market value of the company s available for sale investment portfolio due in large part to an overall general decline in market interest rates 
an additional million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income is mainly attributed to the change in funded status of the company s defined benefit postretirement health insurance plans 
under current regulatory requirements  accumulated other comprehensive amounts related to the net unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale and the funded status of the company s defined benefit postretirement benefit plans do not impact regulatory capital  therefore  they are not included in the risk based capital or leverage ratios that follow 
as previously discussed  the company elected to participate in the treasury s cpp and during early issued thousand shares of preferred stock in return for a million equity investment 
in connection with its participation in the cpp  the company also issued warrants to the treasury to purchase thousand shares of the company s stock at an exercise price of 
the non voting preferred shares issued to the treasury will pay a annual cumulative dividend during the first five years the preferred shares are outstanding  resetting to thereafter if not redeemed  and includes certain restrictions on dividend payments of lower ranking equity 
the company is not restricted in its ability to continue paying quarterly dividends to its common stockholders consistent with historical practice 
under the original terms of the agreement  the company could not redeem the preferred shares during the first three years after issuance except with the proceeds from a qualified equity offering as defined in the treasury s term sheet 
subsequent regulations from the treasury allow cpp participants to now redeem the preferred shares at any time after receiving approval by the treasury and the participant s primary regulator 
the term sheet and additional information about the program are available on the treasury s website at http www

consistent with the objective of operating a sound financial organization  the company s goal is to maintain capital ratios well above the regulatory minimum requirements 
the company s capital ratios as of december  and the regulatory minimums are as follows 
farmers capital bank corporation regulatory minimum tier risk based total risk based leverage the capital ratios of each subsidiary bank were in excess of the applicable minimum regulatory capital ratio requirements at december  the company is not aware of any recommendations by its regulatory authorities which  if implemented  would have a material effect on its capital resources  liquidity  or operations 
the table below is an analysis of dividend payout ratios and equity to asset ratios for the previous five years 
years ended december  percentage of dividends declared to income from continuing operations percentage of average shareholders equity to average total assets excludes assets of discontinued operations 
share buy back program at various times  the company s board of directors has authorized the purchase shares of the company s outstanding common stock 
no stated expiration dates have been established under any of the previous authorizations 
there are  shares that may still be purchased under the various authorizations 
the company s participation in the treasury s cpp in early restricts the company s ability to purchase its outstanding common stock 
until january  the company generally must have the treasury s approval before it can purchase its outstanding common stock  unless all of the series a preferred stock issued under the cpp has been redeemed by the company or transferred by the treasury 
shareholder information as of february   the company had  shareholders of record

for  the company reported a million or increase in net interest income and a higher provision for loan losses of million 
the increase in net interest income is primarily due to higher interest on loans of million or  partially offset by million or higher interest expense on deposits 
the increase in net interest income in was boosted by an additional million related to the citizens jessamine acquisition that occurred during the fourth quarter of net noninterest expense noninterest expense in excess of noninterest income increased million and the provision for income taxes increased thousand 
during  the general trend of the interest rate environment was sharply lower  particularly with short term rates 
in the final half of  the fed lowered the short term federal funds rate by a total of basis points and at year end the rate was 
the prime interest rate declined in a similar manner 
yields on treasury obligations  which impact the value of bond investments and certain funding sources  declined throughout all maturity periods in comparison to a year earlier 
the effect of lower market rates did have a negative impact on the company s net interest spread and margin during  however  at year end the company had yet to absorb the full impact due to the timing of market interest rate changes and the repricing characteristics of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
action by the fed to lower rates during coincided with a decline in many economic data  particularly as it related to the housing market  and the resulting general tightening of credit conditions in the broader economy 
in january  the fed took further action by lowering the federal funds rate by an additional basis points 
this action was taken a result of the heightened concerns over a weakening economic outlook and increasing downside risk to growth  as broader financial market conditions deteriorated and credit had tightened for many businesses and households 
in addition  market data at that time indicated a deepening of the housing contraction as well as softening labor markets
