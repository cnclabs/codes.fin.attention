overview sdi is a biotechnology company with a core mission of developing  commercializing and marketing innovative and proprietary products  services and solutions that preserve and enhance the quality of human health and wellness 
the company believes that its competitive position has been enhanced through the combination of talent  technology and resources resulting from the business development activities it has pursued since its inception 
the company has achieved meaningful economies of scale for the products it offers through the utilization of its consolidated facilities in newark  delaware for the manufacture of test kits and antibodies  and its facilities located in windham  maine and dallas  texas for the manufacture of antibodies 
the company believes that by applying its core competency of creating custom antibodies to assay development  it produces sophisticated diagnostic testing and reagent systems that are responsive to customer diagnostic and information needs 
customers benefit from a quantifiable return on investment by reducing time  labor and or material costs associated with applications for which the company s products are used 
in addition  the company believes its tests provide high levels of accuracy  reliability and actionability of essential test results as compared to alternative products 
the company is focused on sustaining this competitive advantage by leveraging its expertise in immunology  proteomics  bio luminescence and other bio reactive technologies to continue its successful customer focused research and development efforts 
the company believes that an established product base  quality manufacturing expertise  experienced sales and marketing organization  established network of distributors  corporate partner relationships and proven research and development expertise will be critical elements of its potential future success 
in  the company continued the transition from a fragmented product offering and marketing strategy to becoming a focused organization  with proven  proprietary technologies tied directly to its customers needs 
the transition is most evident in the genomic antibody technology gat initiative and food pathogen detection products  where the company believes significant progress is being made 
the company continues to develop and introduce new methods for the detection of food pathogens that deliver a strong competitive advantage to its customers 
in  the company filed a patent for new technology to be used in proprietary enrichments of its food pathogen testing methods 
the patent covers technology for increasing the specificity and sensitivity of the company s immunoassay test methods 
the patent also makes claims for the application of the technology in large scale bio production bio fermentation processes  such as those used in the production of amino acids  ethanol  enzymes and other processes using microbiological production methods 
the company continued to develop multiple channels to market worldwide through an approach that includes direct sales  inside sales  distributors and agents 
the company increased distribution for its food pathogen products in europe and asia where there is growing demand for the company s product line 
the company believes it is making progress in most of its business efforts 
as the deployment of new initiatives is accelerated  building on the company s leadership position in food pathogens and expanding its strong positioning in the emerging area of genomic antibodies  the company anticipates that the revenue lost to market changes in its legacy businesses will be replaced and the company will develop a stronger  more predictable revenue base 
the company expects the gat and food pathogen products to be its primary growth drivers in the future  and that the company s competencies and competitive positions in these two areas are strong

net cash used in investing activities for was  compared to million for these cash outflows were primarily the result of capital purchases which totaled  in versus million in the capital expenditures in were primarily related to the purchase of lab and manufacturing equipment 
the capital expenditures in were primarily related to the company s expansion in maine 
net cash used in financing activities was million for  primarily related to  in debt repayments and  for the purchase of treasury stock 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was million  primarily the result of a million term loan and  from the exercise of stock options 
the company s working capital current assets less current liabilities decreased million to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to the million decrease in cash and cash equivalents in and the reclassification of outstanding debt balances to current liabilities 
outstanding debt decreased to million at december  from million at december  due to scheduled debt payments 
on may   the company entered into a financing agreement with a commercial bank which was amended on october  the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for up to a million revolving line of credit  none of which was outstanding and all of which was available at december  the revolving line of credit bears a variable interest rate of between basis points and basis points over the one month london interbank offered rate libor rate depending upon the ratio of the company s funded debt to ebitda 
the company s effective rate of interest on this line of credit  taking into account the variable interest rate and libor  was at december  on december   the company received a term loan under the credit agreement to finance the construction of new facilities at its windham  maine location 
this agreement provided for up to million in financing   of which was outstanding at december   and is repayable over seven years  with principal payments that began on october  the loan bears a variable interest rate of basis points less than the current prime interest rate 
payments are due monthly  with equal amortization of principal payments plus interest 
the company s effective rate of interest on this loan at december  was 
on august   the company received a term loan under the credit agreement to finance the construction of new facilities at its windham  maine location 
this agreement provided for up to million in financing  million of which was outstanding at december   and is repayable over five years  with principal payments that began on october  the loan bears a fixed interest rate of with equal amortization of principal payments plus interest 
under the credit agreement  the company is required to meet certain quarterly financial covenants that include a ratio of ebitda to current maturities of debt plus interest and cash paid for taxes greater than  a ratio of funded debt to ebitda not to exceed and a requirement of liquid assets cash and cash equivalents to be greater than or equal to million at all times 
the company did not meet its financial covenants with respect to its indebtedness at december  and does not expect that it will be able to meet all of its financial covenants under the credit agreement for the next months 
the company received a waiver of the financial covenants relating to the above financing from its commercial bank as of december  and expects it will continue to receive waivers of the financial covenants until such covenants are amended 
as of december   the company has classified the balance of its long term obligations under the credit agreement of million as current debt in the consolidated balance sheet as the company believes it is probable that there will be a violation of the same covenants within the next months if the covenant terms are not amended 
if the company is unable to obtain a waiver of future debt covenant violations  the company will be unable to draw upon its line of credit until such violations are cured 
as of december   the company is not required to repay these long term debt obligations within months and expects to amend the credit agreement before december  to allow the company to meet its financial covenants and reclassify these long term obligations from current to non current in the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   the outstanding balance on all of the company s commercial bank debt was million 
this indebtedness is secured by substantially all of the company s assets

non gaap financial measures the company presents an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda measure as the company believes this provides investors and the company s management with additional information to measure the company s liquidity 
ebitda measures are not a measure of performance under gaap  and therefore  should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or cash flows from operations 
additionally  the company s ebitda calculations may differ from the ebitda calculations for other companies 
the calculation of the company s ebitda measure as discussed above  and the reconciliation of the company s ebitda measure to net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december  and  respectively  is as follows amounts in thousands year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities changes in assets and liabilities receivables inventories other current assets other assets accounts payable accrued expenses deferred revenue other non current liabilities net change in deferred income tax income tax provision gain loss on disposal of fixed assets stock compensation expense interest income  net ebitda off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k

see discussion of operating leases in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  deferred taxes  long lived assets and stock based compensation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the consolidated results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
valuation of accounts receivable accounts receivable as of december  and december   were net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
the recorded allowance is continually evaluated based on current market conditions  an analysis of customer specific facts and circumstances  and the size and composition of the overall portfolio 
the current state of the economy could cause longer sales cycles resulting in increased risk that outstanding balances could become uncollectible 
if receivables are in dispute with the customer or otherwise deemed uncollectible  the corresponding amounts are written off and are charged against the allowance 
valuation of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
for inventories that consist primarily of test kit components  bulk antibody serum and antibody products  cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
realization of inventories is dependent upon the successful marketing of our products 
judgments are made regarding the carrying value of inventory based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions and customer demand 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by the company impacts the market for previously released products  the company may be required to write down the cost of its inventory 
for inventories that consist of costs associated with the production of custom antibodies  cost is determined using the specific identification method 
realization of such inventories is dependent upon the successful completion of a project in accordance with customer specifications 
losses on projects in progress are recorded in the period such losses become likely and estimable 
deferred taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making their assessment  management considers positive evidence  negative evidence  and possible tax planning strategies that could be implemented 
management also considers the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  recent earnings history  history of or potential for tax attributes such as net operating losses to expire and the ability to project future taxable income 
the company s history of cumulative pre tax losses over the most recent three year period  including  is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome 
in light of this negative evidence  coupled with the current economic conditions  management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the company will not realize the benefits of these tax deductible differences and has established a full valuation allowance offsetting its us federal and state net deferred tax assets at december  at december   the company had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes  which have no expiration and which correspond to a million deferred tax asset  related to operations in the united kingdom uk 
management considered positive and negative indicators in concluding that a substantial valuation allowance of approximately million was necessary for the foreign deferred tax assets of million 
the positive indicators include the contribution to income before taxes by the foreign operations in the uk for  and  and the expected income before taxes in the uk for and the negative indicators include a history of substantial net operating losses in the uk  the lack of income before taxes until and limitations with regard to estimating income in the uk beyond resulting from a year to year evaluation of the future need for a uk subsidiary 
as of december   the company had us federal net operating loss carryforwards  of million  including those of acquired companies  which begin to expire as follows nol in year thousands total revenue recognition revenues composed of sales of immunoassay based test kits and certain antibodies and immunochemical reagents are recognized upon the shipment of the product and transfer of title or when related services are provided 
revenues associated with such products or services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an order exists  shipment of product has occurred or services have been provided  the price is fixed or determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured 
management is required to make judgments based on actual experience about whether or not collectability is reasonably assured 
the company enters into contracts related to the production of custom antibodies  which provide for the performance of defined tasks for a fixed price  with delivery of the product upon completion of production 
the standard time to complete a project is typically longer than days but less than months and effort is expended over the life of the project 
revenues related to sales of custom antibody projects are recognized when a project s specifications have been met and or the related materials have been shipped 
fees associated with products and services added on to a custom antibody project subsequent to delivery of the initial project are billed monthly and recognized as revenue as the services and other deliverables are provided 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds an asset s fair value 
the company reported goodwill of million at december  the company tests goodwill annually in a two step approach 
the first step is the comparison of the carrying value of the company  including goodwill  to the fair value of the company at the testing date 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the company  a second test is performed to measure the amount of an impairment charge  if any 
to measure the amount of any impairment charge  the company determines the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the company were being acquired in a business combination 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to write off goodwill and other intangible assets

sfas r requires the company to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and recognize such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  sfas r requires additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from stock based payment arrangements 
the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the awards and is included in sg a expenses 
sfas r requires management to make estimates and assumptions to determine the grant date fair value of stock options  including the expected term of stock options and the volatility of our stock price in the future 
in addition  assumptions related to expected future forfeitures and performance based vesting features all impact expense recognition 
these assumptions have an impact on the valuation assigned to equity awards and the associated recognition of expense
