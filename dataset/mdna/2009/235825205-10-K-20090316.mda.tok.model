business strategy dana currently has seven operating segments that supply driveshafts  axles  transmissions  structures and engine components to customers in the automotive  commercial vehicle and off highway markets 
we continue to evaluate the strategy for each of these operating segments 
these evaluations include a close analysis of both strategic options and growth opportunities 
while the strategy is still evolving  we currently anticipate a focus primarily on axles and driveshafts driveline products in these markets 
material advancements are playing a key role in this endeavor  with an emphasis on research and development of efficient technologies such as lightweight  high strength aluminum applications  currently in demand 
in  we faced challenges related to declining production levels and increased steel prices 
to address these challenges  we have a comprehensive strategy in place that includes developing and implementing common metrics and operational standards that is being rolled out to all dana operations globally 
through our operational excellence program  we are evaluating all operations  seeking opportunities to reduce costs while improving quality and productivity 
driving our cost structure down and improving our manufacturing efficiency will be critical to our success in as lower production levels will continue to be a 
table of contents major challenge affecting our business 
during  we also worked closely with our major customers to implement pricing arrangements that provide adjustment mechanisms based on steel price movements  thereby positioning us to better mitigate the effects of increased steel prices in the future 
while our north american automotive driveline operations continue to improve  becoming more competitive through consolidation or internal restructuring  we see significant growth opportunities in our non automotive driveline businesses  particularly outside north america 
in the third quarter of  we indicated that we were evaluating a number of strategic options for our non driveline automotive businesses 
we are continuing to evaluate strategic options in the structures segment 
business units we manage our operations globally through seven operating segments 
our products in the automotive market primarily support light vehicle original equipment manufacturers with products for light trucks  sport utility vehicles  crossover utility vehicles  vans and passenger cars 
the operating segments in the automotive markets are light axle  driveshaft  structures  sealing and thermal 
while being primarily focused on the light vehicle automotive market  certain segments also support the commercial vehicle and off highway markets 
two operating segments support the oems of medium duty classes and heavy duty class commercial vehicles primarily trucks and buses and off highway vehicles primarily wheeled vehicles used in construction and agricultural applications commercial vehicle and off highway 
trends in our markets light vehicle markets rest of the world outside of north america  light vehicle production was relatively strong through the first half of however  during the third quarter of  softening market conditions began to surface in europe 
whereas the mid year forecast for western european production levels was comparable to levels  with the significant weakening in demand during the second half of the year  full year production was down about 
production levels in south america and asia pacific during the last six months of also declined from earlier forecasts  with full year production in south america being about stronger than and asia being comparable to the global light vehicle production  excluding north america  was about million units which is down from a mid year forecast that approximated million units and relatively comparable to for  light vehicle production outside of north america is expected to decline to around million units source global insight 
north america north american light vehicle production levels were about lower in the fourth quarter of than in the fourth quarter of and lower for the full year when compared to in the light truck market  fourth quarter production levels were down about versus while the full year production was down 
several vehicles with significant dana content are full size pickups  vans and suvs 
within these categories of the light truck segment  production was more than lower when compared to last year s fourth quarter and lower by about for the full year 
the comparatively lower light truck production levels are consistent with the decline in north american light truck sales which was about from sales 
as with production  the sales decline in full size pickups  vans and suvs during these periods have been even greater at around source ward s automotive 
the weakness in light truck sales has been influenced  in part  by consumer concerns over high fuel prices  declining home values  increased unemployment and other economic factors including access to credit 
while fuel prices have dropped since mid  the uncertainty as to where gasoline prices will stabilize may result in a longer term shift in consumer interest away from trucks and suvs to more fuel efficient passenger cars and cuvs 
while a number of our newer programs involve cuvs  pickup and suv platforms continue to be a key segment for us  particularly with a number of high sales pickup truck platforms 
despite lower production of light trucks during the fourth quarter of  lower sales led to higher inventory levels with days supply at september  increasing to days at december  at this level  the days supply of light trucks in inventory is considerably higher than the days at december  
table of contents while inventory levels for full size pickups and suvs are slightly lower  they increased as well during the fourth quarter of from days at the end of the third quarter to days at december  with the steeper cutbacks in production this past year in this particular segment  days supply in inventory is down from days at the end of given the current level of inventory and the negative economic environment  we expect the weakness in light truck sales and production in north america to continue well into source ward s automotive 
adding to the already difficult market conditions that have existed through most of is the more recent turmoil in the financial markets that has further eroded consumer confidence and tightened availability of credit 
most projections for overall north american light vehicle production for are around to million units down from about million units in source global insight and ward s 
automaker viability globally  oems are moving quickly to cut production  reduce manufacturing costs  lower vehicle prices and clear inventory 
all domestic and even a few of the asian automakers are offering generous consumer incentive and rebate programs 
these programs ultimately put pressure on suppliers to identify additional cost savings in their own manufacturing operations and supply chains 
gm and chrysler presented their viability plans to the us government in february these plans  which outlined how these companies plan to achieve long term sustainability  will require net cost reductions from suppliers 
the impact is already being felt by suppliers 
in january  chrysler issued a letter to its suppliers  demanding a cost reduction from all suppliers effective april  and stated that increased raw material costs must be absorbed by suppliers 
we are continuing to monitor these market conditions 
in january  the original equipment suppliers association oesa conducted its bi monthly supplier barometer survey 
the outcome revealed several key risks that suppliers will face throughout the top three  as identified by oesa members  include decreased production volumes absolute levels and predictability  customer bankruptcy risk especially of an oem  and cash flow as a result of the low production levels and delayed payments 
other significant risks identified include credit availability and multiple supplier bankruptcies 
oem mix the declining sales of light vehicles especially light trucks  which generally have a higher profit margin than passenger cars in north america  as well as losses of market share to competitors such as toyota and nissan  continue to put pressure on three of our largest light vehicle customers ford  gm and chrysler 
these three customers accounted for approximately of light truck production in north america in  as compared to about of light truck production in source global insight 
we expect that any continuing loss of market share by these customers could result in their applying renewed pricing pressure on us relative to our existing business and could make our efforts to generate new business more difficult 
rapid technology changes under the new democratic administration in the us  it is likely that new cafe standards will be implemented quickly 
the revised standard may require vehicles for each manufacturer to achieve an average of miles per gallon by the model year  up from miles per gallon in effect today 
this change will require rapid response by automakers  and represents opportunity for suppliers that are able to supply highly engineered products that will help oems quickly meet these stricter carbon emissions and fuel economy requirements 
the national academy of sciences estimates that fuel economy could be increased by percent while maintaining vehicle size and performance without reducing safety and that midsize cars could average miles per gallon and large pickups nearly miles per gallon  all using existing technology to develop new components and applications 
suppliers  like dana  who are able to provide these new components and applications will fair best in this new environment 
the proposed new cafe standards present a significant opportunity for us  as oems will need to improve the fuel economy and reduce carbon emissions of their vehicles 
our materials and process competencies  and product enhancements can provide oems with needed vehicle weight reduction  assisting them in their efforts to meet the more stringent requirements 

table of contents commercial vehicle markets rest of the world outside of north america  commercial vehicle medium and heavy duty production grew in  particularly in emerging eastern european and asian markets 
global commercial vehicle production  excluding north america  approximated million units in  an increase of about over however  in  our current expectation is that commercial vehicle production outside north america will decline to around million units source global insight and act 
north america developments in this region have a significant impact on our results as north america accounts for more than of our sales in the commercial vehicle market 
production of heavy duty class vehicles during the fourth quarter of of  units was comparable to the same period in for the full year  class production of around  units was down about from the class production comparisons are influenced by the engine emission regulation change which became effective at the beginning of in north america 
first quarter sales benefited from vehicle owners purchasing  from dealer inventory  the lower cost engines built prior to the new emission standards 
production levels for the remainder of were at comparatively lower levels as many customers with new vehicle needs accelerated their purchases into or the first quarter of in advance of the higher costing vehicles meeting new emission requirements 
production levels in the class market have not rebounded as quickly in as previously expected  in part due to higher fuel costs causing customers to postpone purchases of the newer vehicles as a means of minimizing increased overall operating costs 
the commercial vehicle market also is being impacted by the overall financial market turmoil and consequent economic difficulties  leading customers in these markets to be cautious about new vehicle purchases 
the economic factors contributing to lower customer demand and production during the second half of are expected to continue into resulting in forecast class production of about  units  a decline of from source global insight and act 
in the medium duty class market  fourth quarter production of  units was down from last year s fourth quarter 
for the year  medium duty production in was lower than in medium duty production levels have been adversely impacted by high fuel costs and the same economic factors discussed in the light vehicle markets north america market trends section 
production levels in are expected to be similarly impacted  with the unit build forecast at around  lower than source global insight and act 
off highway markets our off highway business  which has become an increasingly more significant component of our total operations over the past three years  accounted for of our sales 
unlike our on highway businesses  our off highway business is larger outside of north america  with more than of its sales coming from outside north america 
we serve several segments of the diverse off highway market  including construction  agriculture  mining and material handling 
our largest markets are the european and north american construction and agriculture equipment segments 
these markets were relatively strong through the first half of  with demand softening during the last six months of the year resulting in full year sales volumes that were comparable to as with our other markets  we are forecasting reductions in demand in the north american and european construction markets of about and reductions in agriculture market demand in of around 
steel costs during  we were challenged with unprecedented levels of steel costs that significantly impacted our results of operations 
higher steel cost is reflected directly in our purchases of various grades of raw steel as well as indirectly through purchases of products such as castings  forgings and bearings 
at present  we annually purchase over one million tons of steel and products with significant steel content 
two commonly used market based indicators of steel prices the tri cities scrap index for bundled scrap steel which represents the monthly average costs in the chicago  cleveland and pittsburgh ferrous scrap markets  as posted by american metal market  and is used by our domestic steel suppliers to 
table of contents determine our monthly surcharge and the spot market price for hot rolled sheet steel illustrate the impact 
scrap prices were relatively stable in and  averaging about per ton in and per ton in during  however  the per ton prices increased significantly  reaching a high of more than per ton before declining to prices of around per ton at the end of the average scrap price of about per ton for the year was higher than in spot prices per ton for hot rolled steel followed a similar pattern  averaging about in and in  increasing in to an average of about per ton  higher than in although steel prices declined significantly during the fourth quarter of  our results did not benefit significantly from the lower cost 
there is a lag time for scrap prices to impact the cost of other steel based products  and with the lower fourth quarter production volumes  we were still working down inventory acquired at higher prices 
agreements with certain customers eliminate or mitigate our exposure to steel cost increases  allowing us to effectively pass all or a portion of the cost on to our customers 
in certain cases  principally in our structures business  we have resale arrangements whereby we purchase the steel at the cost negotiated by our customers and include that cost in the pricing of our products 
in other arrangements  we have material price escalation provisions in customer contracts providing for adjustments to unit prices based on commodity cost increases or decreases over agreed reference periods 
adjustments under these arrangements typically occur at quarterly  semi annual and annual intervals with the adjustment coming in the form of prospective price increases or decreases 
historically  although not always required by existing agreements  we also have been successful in obtaining price increases or surcharges from certain customers as a result of escalating steel costs 
we aggressively pursued steel cost recovery agreements with customers in where not already in place  while also pursuing enhanced recovery terms on existing agreements 
we also took actions to mitigate the impact of steel and other commodity increases by consolidating purchases  contracting with new global steel sources  identifying alternative materials and redesigning our products to be less dependent on higher cost steel grades 
as a result of these efforts  we currently have arrangements in place that we estimate will provide recovery on approximately of prospective steel related cost increases 
these agreements are generally indexed to a base price such that decreased steel costs result in price reductions 
we estimate that higher steel costs adversely impacted our cost of sales in by approximately our recovery efforts partially offset the increased cost  thereby resulting in a net adverse impact on our gross margin for the full year of of approximately with the lag effect associated with certain customer recovery arrangements  a portion of the recovery of cost will be received in as higher prices take effect as part of indexed pricing arrangements with our customers 
sales and earnings outlook we expect the economic factors currently having a negative impact on our markets to persist into and beyond 
by almost any measure  will be a challenging year with production levels in most of our markets forecast to be significantly lower 
to mitigate the effects of lower sales volume  we are aggressively right sizing our cost structure and continuing to pursue increased pricing from customers where programs warrant 
on the cost front  we have reduced the work force during by about  people 
with reductions in the first two months of this year  our employment level has been reduced to about  additional reductions in march are expected to reduce the number of people to around  and we expect to make further reductions during see note of the notes to our financial statements in item for additional discussion relating to our realignment initiatives 
we completed several pricing and material recovery initiatives during the latter part of that will benefit  albeit on lower sales volume 
at our current forecast level for sales  we estimate that material recovery and other pricing actions already finalized in will add more than to gross margin in the combined gross margin improvement from pricing and cost reductions is expected to more than offset the margin impact of lower sales volume 

table of contents growing our sales through new business continues to be an important focus for us 
our current backlog of awarded new business which comes on stream over the next two years more than offsets any programs that are expiring or being co sourced 
while we continue to pursue vigorously new business opportunities  we are doing so with measured discipline to ensure that such opportunities provide acceptable investment returns

additionally  certain agreements such as the labor agreements negotiated with our major unions became effective upon emergence from bankruptcy 
consequently  certain benefits associated with the effectiveness of these agreements  including the elimination of postretirement medical costs in the us  commenced at emergence  thereby benefiting the eleven month results of dana 
results of operations versus geographic sales  segment sales and margin analysis the tables below show our sales by geographic region and by segment for the eleven months ended december   one month ended january  and the year ended december  certain reclassifications were made to conform to the presentation 
although the eleven months ended december  and one month ended january  are distinct reporting periods as a consequence of our emergence from bankruptcy on january   the 
table of contents emergence and fresh start accounting effects had negligible impact on the comparability of sales between the periods 
accordingly  references in our analysis to annual sales information combine the two periods in order to enhance the comparability of such information for the two annual periods 
geographical sales analysis dana prior dana eleven months one month year ended ended ended december  january  december  north america europe south america asia pacific total sales for the combined periods of were lower than sales in currency movements generated of increased sales as a number of the major currencies in international markets where we conduct business strengthened against the us dollar 
exclusive of currency  sales decreased  or  primarily due to lower production levels in each of our markets 
partially offsetting the effects of lower production was improved pricing  largely for recovery of higher material cost 
sales for in north america  adjusted for currency  declined approximately due to the lower production levels in both the light duty and commercial vehicle markets 
light and medium duty truck production was down in compared to and the production of class commercial vehicle trucks was down 
the impact of lower vehicle production levels was partially offset by the impact of higher pricing  principally to recover higher material costs 
sales in europe  south america and asia pacific all benefited from the effects of stronger local currencies against the us dollar 
stronger currencies increased sales by in europe  in south america and in asia pacific 
exclusive of this currency effect  european sales were down against  principally due to the lower production levels in the second half of in south america  year over year production levels were stronger  leading to increased sales of after excluding currency effect 
segment sales analysis dana prior dana eleven months one month year ended ended ended december  january  december  light axle driveshaft sealing thermal structures commercial vehicle off highway other operations total light axle sales declined due principally to lower light truck production levels in north america and europe 
our driveshaft segment serves both the light duty automotive and commercial vehicle markets 
since commercial vehicle production levels did not decline as significantly as those on the light duty side  
table of contents sales in this segment were down only 
increased pricing and favorable currency effects provided a partial offset to the effect of lower production levels in both the light axle and driveshaft segments 
sales in the sealing segment declined 
like the driveshaft segment  the sealing business also supports the commercial vehicle market and has a proportionately larger share of business in europe where the production declines were lower than in north america and a stronger euro provided favorable currency effect 
thermal sales declined  primarily due to lower north american production levels partially offset by favorable currency effect 
lower north american production was also the primary factor leading to an reduction in sales in the structures business 
our commercial vehicle segment is heavily concentrated in the north american market and the overall sales decline of in this segment was primarily due to the drop in north american production levels discussed in the regional review above 
stronger markets outside north america and some pricing improvement partially offset the weaker north american production 
with its significant european presence  our off highway segment benefited from the stronger euro 
exclusive of favorable currency effects of  off highway sales increased due to stronger production levels during the first half of  sales from new programs and increased pricing 
margin analysis the chart below shows our segment margin analysis for the eleven months ended december   one month ended january  and the year ended december  as a percentage of sales dana prior dana eleven months one month year ended ended ended december  january  december  gross margin light axle driveshaft sealing thermal structures commercial vehicle off highway consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses light axle driveshaft sealing thermal structures commercial vehicle off highway consolidated consolidated gross margin margins during the eleven month period ended december  were adversely impacted by two significant factors reduced sales levels and higher steel costs 
adjusted for currency effects  sales in were down from the comparable period  with most of the reduction occurring in the second half of as a result  there has been a lower sales base relative to our fixed costs  negatively affecting margins in the eleven month period ended december  as compared to the first month of and the full previous year 
for the combined periods in  lower sales volumes reduced 
table of contents margin by approximately of sales 
higher steel costs reduced margin by approximately of sales 
gross margins during the eleven month period ended december  were also reduced by about resulting from the fresh start accounting effects discussed below 
partially offsetting these adverse developments were benefits from the reorganization actions undertaken in connection with the bankruptcy process customer pricing improvement  labor cost savings  overhead cost reduction and manufacturing footprint optimization 
those customer pricing actions began contributing to gross margins in the first quarter of  with additional pricing improvements being achieved over the course of and into the results reflect a full year of customer pricing improvements while includes only a portion thereof 
pricing improvements unrelated to the reorganization process  primarily associated with recovery of higher steel cost  were also achieved  which when combined with the reorganization related pricing actions increased margin by approximately during the eleven months ended december  and the month of january we did not begin benefiting significantly from non union employee benefit plan reductions and other labor savings until the first quarter of with much of the savings associated with the agreements negotiated with the unions only becoming effective upon our emergence on january  labor cost savings associated with the reorganization initiatives and other actions added approximately to margin in the eleven months ended december   while overhead reduction  manufacturing footprint and increased pricing actions provided additional margin improvement 
in connection with the application of fresh start accounting  margins were negatively impacted by two factors 
at emergence  inventory values were increased in accordance with fresh start accounting requirements 
with respect to our us inventories which are carried on a lifo basis  the stepped up value of the inventory became part of the base lifo layer and will not be recognized in cost of sales under lifo costing until there is a decrement of the base layer 
in the case of inventories outside the us which are carried on a fifo or average cost basis  the fresh start adjustment of was recorded as cost of sales in the first and second quarters of as the inventory was sold 
the other factor negatively impacting margins as a result of fresh start accounting was higher depreciation expense on the stepped up value of fixed assets and amortization expense associated with technology related intangibles recognized at emergence 
this higher depreciation and amortization reduced margin for the eleven months ended december  by approximately in the light axle segment  reduced sales volume led to margin reduction of approximately of sales  while higher steel costs resulted in lower margin of about of sales 
partially offsetting these effects were customer pricing improvement and labor cost reductions which contributed approximately of sales to margin and other cost reductions and operational improvements 
driveshaft  like the light axle segment  experienced margin reduction from lower sales volume 
the reduction attributed to lower sales approximated of sales  and higher steel resulted in lower margin of of sales 
also reducing margin in the driveshaft segment was higher depreciation and amortization expense of of sales attributed primarily to the application of fresh start accounting 
partially offsetting these reductions were improvements to driveshaft margin of approximately of sales from increased customer pricing and labor cost savings 
in the sealing segment  the gross margin decline was primarily due to lower sales volume and higher depreciation and amortization resulting from application of fresh start accounting 
these effects were partially offset by lower material cost  currency effect and cost reductions 
gross margin in our thermal segment declined due to lower sales volume  additional warranty cost and higher depreciation and amortization 
our structures business was significantly impacted by lower sales levels which reduced margin by approximately of sales 
mitigating the effects of lower sales were improved pricing and labor savings which improved margin by about of sales and lower depreciation and amortization expense related to fresh start accounting which increased margin by of sales 
gross margin in the commercial vehicle segment in was negatively affected by lower sales volume and higher steel costs which reduced margin by about of sales and of sales 
offsetting some of the reduction due to these factors was additional pricing of approximately of sales and 
table of contents lower depreciation and amortization expense 
in the off highway segment  the gross margin decline was primarily due to higher material costs of about of sales in  increased warranty expense of and increased depreciation and amortization expense of of sales 
the margin reduction from these and other factors was partially offset by improved pricing of of sales 
corporate and other gross margin consolidated gross margin is impacted by cost of sales activity in corporate and other related to applying lifo costing to inventory in the us and full absorption costing globally 
our operating segments report inventory and cost of sales on a fifo basis 
during the eleven months ended december   increases in steel and other commodity costs resulted in the fifo based value of our us inventory  as reported by the operating segments  increasing by accordingly  adjusting this inventory to a lifo basis in consolidation required a charge to cost of sales in corporate and other in a credit to cost of sales of was recognized in the month of january during  lifo based charges to cost of sales amounted to the application of full absorption costing consists principally of reclassifying certain expenses to cost of sales that are reported by the operating segments as sg a 
these costs are reviewed and adjusted annually 
cost of sales increased and sg a decreased by for the one month ended january   for the eleven months ended december  and by for the year ended december  due to the application of fresh start accounting  corporate and other in the eleven months ended december  also includes a charge of to amortize  under the fifo costing method used by our operations  the fresh start step up of our global inventories 
this charge is partially offset by the adjustment required to retain the fresh start step up under the lifo costing method used in the us for financial reporting and tax purposes 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the combined periods in  sg a of is lower by from the expense 
both the combined periods and sg a expense were of sales 
the period expense benefited from certain labor and overhead cost reduction initiatives implemented in connection with the bankruptcy reorganization process as well as additional reductions implemented post emergence 
additionally  the expense included a provision for short term incentive compensation  whereas nothing was provided in based on that year s results 
partially offsetting the factors reducing year over year sg a expense was additional costs incurred during in connection with personnel changes and restoring long term incentive plans 
also adversely impacting the year over year margin comparison was a reduction in long term disability accruals in amortization of intangibles amortization of customer relationship intangibles recorded in connection with applying fresh start accounting at the date of emergence resulted in expense of for the eleven months ended december  realignment charges and impairments realignment charges are primarily costs associated with the workforce reduction actions and facility closures  certain of which were part of the manufacturing footprint optimization actions that commenced in connection with our bankruptcy plan of reorganization 
these actions are more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item realignment charges in include of cost relating to the settlement of our pension obligations in the united kingdom  which was completed in april we recorded for impairment of goodwill and for impairment of indefinite lived intangibles during the eleven months ended december  we recorded for impairment of goodwill during as discussed more fully in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item other income  net net currency transaction losses reduced other income by in the eleven months ended december  while net gains of were recognized in the month of january this compares to of net currency transaction gains in dcc asset sales and divestitures provided other income of in  but only minimal income in other income in also benefited from interest income of in the eleven months ended december  and in the month of january as compared to in other income in the eleven month period ended december  includes a charge of to recognize the loss incurred in connection with repayment of our term debt in 
table of contents november costs of approximately have been incurred in in connection with the evaluation of strategic alternatives relating to certain businesses 
other income in also included a one time claim settlement charge of representing the cost to settle a contractual matter with an investor in one of our equity investments 
interest expense interest expense includes the costs associated with the exit financing facility and other debt agreements which are described in detail in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item interest expense in the eleven months ended december  includes of amortized oid recorded in connection with the exit financing facility and of amortized debt issuance costs 
also included is associated with the accretion of certain liabilities that were recorded at discounted values in connection with the adoption of fresh start accounting upon emergence from bankruptcy 
during and the month of january  as a result of the bankruptcy reorganization process  a substantial portion of our debt obligations were reported as liabilities subject to compromise in our consolidated financial statements with no interest expense being accrued on these obligations 
the interest expense not recognized on these obligations amounted to in and during the month of january reorganization items reorganization items are expenses directly attributed to our chapter reorganization process 
see note of the notes to our financial statements in item for a summary of these costs 
during the bankruptcy process  there were ongoing advisory fees of professionals representing dana and the other bankruptcy constituencies 
certain of these costs continued subsequent to emergence as there are disputed claims which require resolution  claims which require payment and other post emergence activities incident to emergence from bankruptcy 
among these ongoing costs are expenses associated with additional facility unionization under the framework of the global agreements negotiated with the unions as part of our reorganization activities 
reorganization items in the month of january include a gain on the settlement of liabilities subject to compromise and several one time emergence costs  including the cost of employee stock bonuses  transfer taxes  and success fees and other fees earned by certain professionals upon emergence 
income tax expense in the us and certain other countries  our recent history of operating losses does not allow us to satisfy the more likely than not criterion for realization of deferred tax assets 
consequently  there is no income tax benefit against the pre tax losses of these jurisdictions as valuation allowances are established offsetting the associated tax benefit or expense 
in the us  the other comprehensive income oci reported for caused us to record tax expense in oci and recognize a us tax benefit of in continuing operations 
for  the valuation allowance impacts in the above mentioned countries  the fresh start adjustments and the impairment of goodwill in and are the primary factors which cause the tax expense of for the eleven months ended december   for the month of january  and for to differ from an expected tax benefit of  tax expense of and tax benefit of for those periods at the us federal statutory rate of discontinued operations our engine hard parts  fluid products and pump products operations had been reported as discontinued operations 
the sales of these businesses were substantially completed in  except for a portion of the pump products business that was sold in january the results for reflect the operating results of these businesses as well as adjustments to the net assets of these businesses necessary to reflect their fair value less cost to sell based on expected sales proceeds

results of operations versus geographic sales  segment sales and margin analysis versus the tables below show our sales by geographic region and segment for the years ended december  and certain reclassifications were made to conform and to the presentation 

table of contents geographic sales analysis amount of change due to prior dana increase currency acquisitions organic decrease effects divestitures change north america europe south america asia pacific total sales increased from to stronger currencies in our major foreign markets as compared to an overall weaker us dollar resulted in positive currency movements on sales 
sales in were reduced by net divestiture impacts  principally due to a reduction resulting from the sale of our trailer axle business in january partially offsetting this loss of sales was an increase resulting from the july purchase of the axle and driveshaft businesses previously owned by spicer sa  our equity affiliate in mexico 
excluding currency and net divestiture effects  organic sales in were relatively flat compared to organic change is the period on period measure of the change in sales that excludes the effects of currency movements  acquisitions and divestitures 
regionally  north american sales were down 
a stronger canadian dollar increased sales slightly 
the divestiture of the trailer axle business partially offset by additional axle and driveshaft business acquired from our previous equity affiliate in mexico combined to decrease sales by excluding these effects  organic sales were down 
lower production levels in the north american commercial vehicle market were the primary contributor to lower organic sales 
class vehicle production was down more than while medium duty production of class vehicles was down more than 
new engine emission requirements effective at the beginning of increased costs and led many vehicle owners to accelerate their purchases in consequently  production levels in benefited from this pull forward of customer demand  while levels were lower 
in north america  our organic sales to the commercial vehicle market were down more than compared to partially offsetting the impact of lower commercial vehicle build was higher production levels in the north american light truck market 
year over year light truck production increased  with the vehicle platforms on which we have our highest content up even more 
sales to the off highway market also increased in  principally from new customer programs 
additionally  north american sales in benefited from pricing improvements of approximately sales in europe increased 
stronger european currencies relative to the us dollar accounted for approximately half of the increase 
the organic sales increase was due in part to net new business in of approximately additionally  production levels in two of our key markets the european light vehicle and the off highway markets were somewhat stronger in than in in south america  the sales increase resulted from somewhat stronger year over year production levels in our major vehicular markets  and also from stronger currencies in this region 
sales in asia pacific similarly increased due to currencies in that region also strengthening against the us dollar 

table of contents segment sales analysis amount of change due to prior dana increase currency acquisitions organic decrease effects divestitures change light axle driveshaft sealing thermal structures commercial vehicle off highway other operations total customer related pricing improvements contributed approximately to organic sales growth in our automotive segments in  while the net effects of significantly lower commercial vehicle production  somewhat higher light vehicle production and sales mix reduced organic sales 
in our light axle segment  pricing improvements  new customer programs and higher production levels contributed to the higher sales 
our driveshaft segment sells to the commercial vehicle market as well as the light vehicle market 
the significant decline in commercial vehicle production levels more than offset stronger light duty production levels and pricing improvements  leading to a slight decline in this unit s organic sales 
neither the thermal nor sealing segment benefited significantly from pricing improvement or new business  consequently  the organic sales change in these operations was primarily due to production level changes and business mix 
in structures  higher sales due to stronger production levels and improved pricing were more than offset by discontinued programs  including the expiration of a frame program with ford in our commercial vehicle segment is heavily concentrated in the north american market and the organic decline in sales of in this segment was primarily due to the drop in north american production levels discussed in the regional review 
organic growth in sales of the off highway segment resulted from stronger production levels and new programs 
with its significant european presence  this segment s sales also benefited from the stronger euro

the customer pricing actions began contributing to gross margins in the first quarter of also contributing to this margin improvement were the benefit plan reductions effectuated in which discontinued future service accruals under non union employee pension plans and eliminated retiree postretirement benefits other than pension opeb for non union active employees and retirees 
we did not begin benefiting from savings associated with the amended union agreements for similar plans until after emergence 
additionally  currency effects due to an overall weaker us dollar as compared to major currencies in other global markets positively impact margins 
segments gross margin customer pricing improvements of approximately were the principal factor increasing margins 
reductions to non union benefit plans also contributed some additional margin 
partially offsetting these improvements were negative impacts from sales mix and expiration of higher margin programs 
in the light axle segment  customer pricing actions increased margins by approximately  or of sales 
non union employee benefit plan reductions and lower material costs also contributed to margin improvement 
although light axle sales were up significantly in  the sales mix was unfavorable with a significant portion of the higher sales coming from vehicle platforms with lower margins 
the driveshaft segment experienced a margin decline despite a year over year sales increase 
adverse sales mix was a major factor as the driveshaft segment sells to customers in both the light duty automotive market and the commercial vehicle market 
lower production levels in the north american commercial vehicle market reduced driveshaft sales by about margins on the commercial vehicle business are higher than the light duty automotive programs  so the sales decline negatively impacted overall margins 
premium freight cost associated with operational 
table of contents inefficiencies reduced margins by about partially offsetting the negative margin effects of the adverse sales mix and some operational inefficiencies was margin improvement of approximately of sales due to customer pricing and lower material costs 
margins in the sealing segment were down primarily due to higher material costs of approximately  or of sales 
stainless steel is a major material component for this business  and the average cost of stainless steel in was about higher than in the higher raw material cost was partially offset by margin improvements from non union benefit plan reductions and operational cost reduction actions 
our thermal segment experienced a margin decline in operational inefficiencies and warranty cost associated with our european operation reduced margins by about  and higher start up costs associated with our hungary and china operations negatively impacted margins by additionally  the strengthening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar also negatively impacted our margin in this business as certain product manufactured in canada is sold in us dollars 
in our structures segment  margins increased with customer pricing actions contributing approximately  or of sales 
this margin improvement was partially offset by unfavorable margin effects associated with the lower sales in this unit  principally due to expiration of two significant customer programs 
commercial vehicle segment margins improved despite significantly lower sales on reduced production levels in the north american market 
more than offsetting the unfavorable margin impact of the lower production levels was increased pricing which improved margins by about  or of sales 
in the off highway segment  margins were flat 
higher sales relative to fixed costs and reduced material costs benefited margins 
however  margins were negatively impacted by a stronger euro as we manufacture some product in europe for sale in dollars to the us higher warranty costs of also reduced our margins in this business 
corporate and other gross margin certain corporate expenses and other costs are not allocated to the business units 
this activity is largely related to recognizing full absorption inventory costing adjustments at the consolidated level 
inventoriable costs are reclassified to cost of sales from sg a 
additionally  the operating segments report inventory and cost of sales on a fifo basis  with adjustments made in consolidation to reflect the inventory and cost of sales of the us operations on a lifo basis 
segments selling  general and administrative expenses the light axle  driveshaft and structures improvements reflect the labor and overhead cost reduction initiatives implemented in connection with the bankruptcy reorganization process 
the sealing and thermal segments were not impacted as significantly by these initiatives 
the commercial vehicle and off highway segments also benefited from the bankruptcy related cost reduction actions 
however  additional costs in the commercial vehicle segment resulted in an overall deterioration of in the sg a ratio 
corporate and other selling  general and administrative expenses reduced costs reflect our overall efforts to reduce overhead through headcount reduction  limited wage increases and cutbacks in discretionary spending 
realignment charges and impairments realignment charges during included of cost relating to settlement of pension obligations in the united kingdom as described more fully in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 
other realignment charges in and the charges in are primarily costs associated with our manufacturing footprint optimization actions 
in connection with our annual assessment of goodwill  we recorded for impairment of goodwill related to our thermal business during this business experienced significant margin erosion in recent years resulting from the higher cost of commodities  especially aluminum 
the impairment charges in include charges of to reduce lease and other assets in dcc to their fair value less cost to sell  a charge of to adjust our equity investment in getrag to fair value based on the march sale of this investment and a charge to write off the goodwill in our light axle business 
each of these charges is described further in notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 
table of contents other income  net foreign exchange gains increased other income  net by over certain cross currency intercompany loan balances that were previously designated as invested indefinitely were identified for repayment through near term repatriation actions 
foreign exchange gains and losses on loans that are not considered permanently invested are included in the income statement whereas movements on loans that are permanently invested are reported in oci 
as a consequence  exchange rate movements on these loans and others not permanently invested generated currency gains of during other currency losses netted to reduce other income in by dcc income was lower by in as we continued to sell the remaining portfolio assets in this operation

interest expense as a result of our chapter reorganization process  a substantial portion of our debt obligations were recorded as subject to compromise in our consolidated financial statements 
during the bankruptcy reorganization process  interest expense was no longer accrued on these obligations 
the post filing interest expense not recognized on these obligations amounted to in and in reorganization items reorganization items are expenses directly attributed to our chapter reorganization process 
higher professional advisory fees in were due to a full year of reorganization activity  including the completion of the settlement agreements with the unions and the confirmation of our plan 
higher contract rejection and claim settlement costs in resulted from specific actions related to contract settlements made to facilitate the reorganization process 
these higher settlement costs were partially offset by a credit to reorganization items to reduce liabilities for long term disability to amounts allowed by the bankruptcy court for filed claims 
additional information relating to reorganization items is provided in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item income tax benefit expense our reported income tax expense for was as compared to an expected benefit of derived by applying the us federal income tax rate of to the reported loss before tax for continuing operations 
among the factors contributing to the higher tax expense are losses generated in countries such as the us and us where we determined that future taxable income was not likely to be sufficient to realize existing net deferred tax assets 
as a consequence  until such time that it is determined that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize deferred tax assets  the tax benefits from losses in these countries are generally offset with a valuation allowance 
during  we incurred of charges relating to the settlement of pension obligations in the uk  and the tax benefit associated with these charges was offset with valuation allowances 
although we have a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in the us  as discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item  the level of other comprehensive income generated during in the us enabled us to recognize of tax benefits on us losses before income taxes 
the net effect on income tax expense of recording valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the us  us and other countries was other factors resulting in the reported income tax expense being higher than the benefit expected at the us rate of were non deductible expenses and recognition of costs associated with repatriation of undistributed earnings of operations outside the us income before taxes included goodwill impairment charges  certain reorganization costs and other items which are not deductible for income tax purposes 
these items resulted in approximately of the of higher reported income tax than the of benefit expected using the us rate of 
the recognition of taxes associated with the planned repatriation of non us earnings also described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item resulted in a charge of the primary factor resulting in income tax expense of during  as compared to a tax benefit of that would be expected based on the us federal income tax rate  was the inability to recognize tax benefits on us losses following the determination in that future taxable income was not likely to ensure realization of net deferred tax assets 
also impacting the rate differential was of goodwill impairment charges which are not deductible for income tax purposes 

table of contents discontinued operations losses from discontinued operations were and  net of tax  in and discontinued operations in both years included the engine hard parts  fluid routing and pump products businesses held for sale at the end of and the results included net losses of recognized upon completion of the sale  while the results included pre tax impairment charges of that were required to reduce the net book value of these businesses to expected fair value less cost to sell 
the discontinued operations results in also include charges of in connection with a bankruptcy claim settlement with the purchaser of a previously sold discontinued business and charges of for settlement of pension obligations relating to discontinued businesses 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item for additional information relating to the discontinued operations 
liquidity as discussed in part  item a risk factors  there are several risks and uncertainties relating to the global economy and our industry that could materially affect our future financial performance and liquidity 
among the potential outcomes  these risks and uncertainties could result in decreased sales  limited access to credit  rising costs  increased global competition  customer or supplier bankruptcies  delays in customer payment terms and acceleration of supplier payments  growing inventories and failure to meet debt covenants 
during the second half of  our production volumes decreased significantly 
whereas year over year sales for the first half of were higher  year over year sales in the third quarter and fourth quarter were down and 
our cash position declined from  at june  to at the end of the repayment of principal and fees in connection with the amendment of the financial covenants and other provisions of our exit facility reduced cash by the remaining was used primarily for operating needs and capital expenditures 
our current revenue forecast for is determined from specific platform volume projections consistent with a north american light vehicle production estimate of million units  class commercial vehicle build of  units and class truck build of  units 
changes to the total north american light vehicle production levels may not materially affect our revenue assumptions because our primary exposure to this market is concentrated on specific vehicle platforms which do not necessarily move in the same manner as other platforms 
elsewhere in the world  we expect full year light vehicle production volumes to be down about against in our off highway business  our forecast contemplates that customer demand in our key agriculture and construction markets will be down and from in light of these volume estimates  we ve accelerated additional cost reduction and cash preservation initiatives 
we have taken significant actions in the last quarter of and early to reduce our cost base and improve profitability  including workforce reductions  reduced capital spending and pricing adjustments with our customers 
based on our current forecast for  we expect to be able to meet the financial covenants of our existing debt agreements and have sufficient liquidity to finance our operations 
while we believe that the above market demand assumptions underlying our current forecast are reasonable  we ve also considered the possibility of even weaker demand based generally on more pessimistic production level forecasts eg north american light vehicle production of about million units 
in addition to the above external factors potentially impacting our sales  achieving our current forecast is dependent upon a number of internal factors such as our ability to execute our remaining cost reduction plans  to operate effectively within the reduced cost structure and to realize the projected pricing improvements 
we ve also considered the potential consequences of a bankruptcy filing by two of our major customers  general motors gm and chrysler 
sales to gm in were of our consolidated sales  while chrysler represented approximately 
in the event of a bankruptcy filing on the part of either of these customers  we believe it is likely that most of our programs would be continued following a bankruptcy filing 
as such  we expect the adverse effects of these bankruptcies would be limited principally to recovering less than the full amount of the outstanding receivable from these customers at the time of any such filing 
we would expect our exposure under this scenario to be in the range of to depending on a number of factors  including the age and level of receivables at the time of a bankruptcy filing and whether we are treated as a critical supplier 

table of contents if the more pessimistic sales scenario described above and a gm and chrysler bankruptcy filing occur or if our success in achieving price increases from our customers is less than anticipated we believe we could still satisfy our debt covenants and the liquidity needs of the business during through incremental cost reductions  including headcount actions  compensation and employee benefit modifications  and further reductions in plant and administrative overhead cost 
notwithstanding this assessment  there is a high degree of uncertainty in the current environment  and it is possible that certain scenarios would result in our not being able to comply with the financial covenants in our debt agreements or maintain sufficient liquidity 
while we are confident of our ability to achieve the plan  there can be no assurance we will be successful 
there are a number of factors that could potentially arise that could result in our not attaining the plan or otherwise creating liquidity issues 
these factors include but are not limited to the following failure to achieve the price increases and cost reduction goals  sustained weakness and or combined deterioration in global conditions failure of gm and chrysler to meet the terms and conditions of us government loans bankruptcy of any significant customer resulting in delayed payments and or non payment of trade accounts receivable and customer tooling receivables 
bankruptcy of any significant supplier resulting in delayed shipment of production materials or actions to accelerate payments for goods or services 
loan covenant violations non compliance with the covenants would provide our lenders with the ability to demand immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the term facility and the revolving facility 
we would not have sufficient cash on hand to satisfy this demand 
accordingly  the inability to comply with covenants  obtain waivers for non compliance  or obtain alternative financing would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in the event we were unable to meet our debt covenant requirements  however  we believe we would be able to obtain a waiver or amend the covenants 
obtaining such waivers or amendments would likely result in a significant incremental cost 
although we cannot provide assurance that we would be successful in obtaining the necessary waivers or in amending the covenants  we were able to do so in and are confident that we would be able to do so in  if necessary 
based on our current forecast and our assessment of reasonably possible scenarios  including the more pessimistic scenario described above  we do not believe that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in our global liquidity at december  was as follows cash less deposits supporting obligations cash in less than wholly owned subsidiaries available cash additional cash availability from lines of credit in the us and europe additional lines of credit supported by letters of credit from the revolving facility total global liquidity as of december  consolidated cash balances totaled  approximately of which is located in the united states 
approximately of our cash balances relate to deposits that support other obligations  primarily guarantees for workers compensation 
an additional is held by less than wholly owned subsidiaries where our access may be restricted 
our ability to efficiently access cash balances in 
table of contents certain foreign jurisdictions is subject to local regulatory and statutory requirements 
our current credit ratings b and caa by standard and poor s and moody s  respectively and the current state of the global financial markets would make it very difficult for us to raise capital in the debt markets 
the principal sources of liquidity for our future cash requirements are expected to be i cash flows from operations  ii cash and cash equivalents on hand  iii proceeds related to our trade receivable securitization and financing programs and iv borrowings from the revolving facility 
at december   there were borrowings under our european trade receivable securitization program equivalent to recorded as notes payable and of remaining availability based on the borrowing base 
at december   we had no borrowings under the revolving facility but we had utilized for letters of credit 
based on our borrowing base collateral  we had availability at that date under the revolving facility of after deducting the outstanding letters of credit 
during the fourth quarter of  one of our lenders failed to honor its share of the funding obligation under the terms of our revolving facility and was a defaulting lender 
if this lender does not honor its obligation in the future  our availability could be reduced by up to 
additionally  our ability to borrow the full amount of availability under our revolving credit facility is effectively limited by the financial covenants 
based on the covenant requirements at december   our additional borrowings are limited to based on our current forecast we believe that our overall liquidity and operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for capital expenditures  working capital  debt obligations and other commitments throughout these projections do not include the additional liquidity that could be generated by sales of assets and divestitures of businesses 
a bankruptcy filing by gm and chrysler could impact our availability under the revolving facility 
removal of gm and chrysler receivables from the borrowing base at december  would reduce availability by however  since our availability is already limited by the debt covenants  removal of the gm and chrysler receivables at december  would not limit our availability further 
at december  we were in compliance with the debt covenants under the amended term facility with a leverage ratio of compared to a maximum of and an interest coverage ratio of compared to a minimum of and  as indicated above  we expect to be able to maintain compliance during refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to the covenants and other relevant provisions in our credit facilities 
the amended exit facility and european receivables loan facility include material adverse change provisions that  if exercised by our lenders  could adversely affect our financial condition by restricting future borrowing 
we are not aware of any existing conditions that would limit our ability to obtain funding as a result of the material adverse change provisions 
these credit facilities also include customary events of default for facilities of this type which could give our lenders the right  among other things  to restrict future borrowings  terminate their commitments  accelerate the repayment of obligations and foreclose on the collateral granted to them

dcc cash that was restricted during bankruptcy by a forbearance agreement with dcc noteholders was released in january as payments were made to the noteholders 
financing activities at our emergence from bankruptcy  we obtained proceeds of  under a new term facility and obtained a line of credit under a revolving facility

all of these proceeds were used in part to repay the outstanding under the dip credit agreement  pay exit facility oid costs and fees of  and retire the remaining amount owed to dcc noteholders through settlement of dcc s bankruptcy claim against prior dana 
in october  we borrowed under the revolving facility 
as discussed above  one of our lenders failed to honor its obligation of the amounts outstanding under the revolving facility were repaid in december 
in november  we amended the term facility 
we incurred additional fees to the creditors of which are being amortized over the remaining life of the debt 
in connection with the amendment  we repaid of the term facility 
our financial covenants were adjusted and the interest rate on this facility was increased by basis points

these amounts represent future interest payments based on the debt balances at december payments related to variable rate debt are based on march  interest rates 
capital and operating leases related to real estate  vehicles and other assets 
the unconditional purchase obligations presented are comprised principally of commitments for procurement of fixed assets and the purchase of raw materials 
also included are payments under our long term agreement with ibm for the outsourcing of certain human resource services 
these amounts represent estimated contributions to our global defined benefit pension plans 
we have not estimated pension contributions beyond due to the significant impact that return on plan assets and changes in discount rates might have on such amounts 
these amounts represent estimated obligations under our non us retiree healthcare programs 
obligations under the retiree healthcare programs are not fixed commitments and will vary depending on various factors  including the level of participant utilization and inflation 
our estimates of the payments to be made in the future consider recent payment trends and certain of our actuarial assumptions 
these amounts represent expected payments  with interest  for uncertain tax positions as of december  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the fin liability in individual years beyond due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 
pursuant to the plan  we also issued million shares of series a preferred and million shares of series b preferred 
dividend obligations of approximately per quarter will be incurred while all shares of preferred stock are outstanding 
the payment of preferred dividends was suspended in november under the terms of our amended term facility and may resume when our total leverage ratio as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter is less than or equal to 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item at december   we maintained cash balances of on deposit with financial institutions to support surety bonds  letters of credit and bank guarantees and to provide credit enhancements for certain lease agreements 
these surety bonds enable us to self insure our workers compensation obligations 
we accrue the estimated liability for workers compensation claims  including incurred but not reported claims 
accordingly  no significant impact on our financial condition would result if the surety bonds were called 
contingencies for a summary of litigation and other contingencies  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item we do not believe that any liabilities that may result from these contingencies are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or financial condition 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
considerable judgment is often involved in making these determinations 
critical estimates are those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we evaluate these estimates and judgments on a regular basis 
we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
however  the use of different assumptions could result in significantly different results and actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following discussion of accounting estimates is intended to supplement the summary of significant accounting policies presented as note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item income taxes accounting for income taxes is complex  in part  because we conduct business globally and therefore file income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the income tax provision  uncertain tax positions  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance is provided when  in our judgment  based upon available information  it is more likely than not that a portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to make this assessment  we consider the historical and projected future taxable income or loss in different tax jurisdictions and we review our tax planning strategies 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets and us and foreign operating and other loss carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain 
since future financial results may differ from previous estimates  periodic adjustments to our valuation allowance may be necessary 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain 
we are regularly under audit by the various applicable tax authorities 
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain  we believe that we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns and that our annual tax provisions include amounts sufficient to pay assessments  if any  which may be proposed by the taxing authorities 
nonetheless  the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 
see additional discussion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item retiree benefits accounting for pensions and opeb involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
these plan expenses and obligations are dependent on assumptions developed by us in consultation with our outside advisors such as actuaries and other consultants and are generally calculated independently of funding requirements 
the assumptions used  including inflation  discount rates  investment returns  life expectancies  turnover rates  retirement rates  future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates  have a significant impact on plan expenses and obligations 
these assumptions are regularly reviewed and modified when appropriate based on historical experience  current trends and the future outlook 
changes in one or more of the underlying assumptions could result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in any given period 
if actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position and results of operations in future periods could be affected 
the inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
retirement  turnover and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
health care cost trend rates are developed based on our actual historical claims experience  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
for our largest plans  discount rates are based upon the construction of a theoretical bond portfolio  adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for the future obligations 
a yield curve was developed based on a subset of these high quality fixed income investments those with yields between the th and th percentiles 
the projected cash flows were matched to this yield curve and a present value 
table of contents developed which was then calibrated to develop a single equivalent discount rate 
pension benefits are funded through deposits with trustees that satisfy  at a minimum  the applicable funding regulations 
for our largest defined benefit pension plans  expected investment rates of return are based upon input from the plan s investment advisors and actuary regarding our expected investment portfolio mix  historical rates of return on those assets  projected future asset class returns  the impact of active management and long term market conditions and inflation expectations 
we believe that the long term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation and we regularly review the actual asset allocation to periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate 
opeb benefits are funded as they become due 
actuarial gains or losses may result from changes in assumptions or when actual experience is different from that expected 
under the applicable standards  those gains and losses are not required to be immediately recognized as expense  but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over future periods 
a change in the pension discount rate of basis points would result in a change in our pension obligations of approximately and a change in pension expense of approximately a basis point change in the rate of return would change pension expense by approximately restructuring actions involving facility closures and employee downsizing and divestitures frequently give rise to adjustments to employee benefit plan obligations  including the recognition of curtailment or settlement gains and losses 
upon the occurrence of these events  the obligations of the employee benefit plans affected by the action are also re measured based on updated assumptions as of the re measurement date 
see additional discussion of our pension and opeb obligations in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item long lived asset impairment we perform periodic impairment analyses on our long lived amortizable assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
when indications are present  we compare the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate to their carrying amount 
if the operations are determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of their assets  the long lived assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  third party appraisals or other methods that provide appropriate estimates of value 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests  principally in determining whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review and the fair value of the operations 
in addition  in all of our segments except structures and thermal  a reduction in the projected cash flows or the peer multiples would not result in impairment of long lived assets including the definite lived intangible assets 
in structures and thermal  a reduction in the projected cash flows or the peer multiples would result in impairment 
while we believe our judgments and assumptions were reasonable  changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in any given period 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment as of october of each year for all of our reporting units  or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would warrant such a review 
we make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time  which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
we also utilize market valuation models which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and businesses 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units were reasonable 
in addition  a reduction in the projected cash flows and the peer multiples in the off highway segment would not result in additional impairment in this segment 
however  different assumptions could materially affect the results 
as described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item  we recorded goodwill impairment of in related to our driveshaft business segment 

table of contents indefinite life intangible valuations are generally based on revenue streams 
we impaired indefinite life intangibles by in the eleven months ended december  additional reductions in forecasted revenue could result in additional impairment 
warranty costs related to product warranty obligations are estimated and accrued at the time of sale with a charge against cost of sales 
warranty accruals are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate based on occurrences giving rise to potential warranty exposure and associated experience 
warranty accruals and adjustments require significant judgment  including a determination of our involvement in the matter giving rise to the potential warranty issue or claim  our contractual requirements  estimates of units requiring repair and estimates of repair costs 
if actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position and results of operations in future periods could be affected 
contingency reserves we have numerous other loss exposures  such as environmental claims  product liability and litigation 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded liabilities for loss 
fresh start accounting as required by gaap  in connection with emergence from chapter  we adopted the fresh start accounting provisions of sop effective february  under sop  the reorganization value represents the fair value of the entity before considering liabilities and approximates the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of dana immediately after restructuring 
the reorganization value is allocated to the respective fair value of assets 
the excess reorganization value over the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets is recorded as goodwill 
liabilities  other than deferred taxes  are stated at present values of amounts expected to be paid 
fair values of assets and liabilities represent our best estimates based on our appraisals and valuations 
where the foregoing were not available  industry data and trends or references to relevant market rates and transactions were used 
these estimates and assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies beyond our reasonable control 
moreover  the market value of our common stock may differ materially from the fresh start equity valuation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risks including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  adverse movements in commodity prices for products we use in our manufacturing and adverse changes in interest rates 
to reduce our exposure to these risks  we maintain risk management controls to monitor these risks and take appropriate actions to attempt to mitigate such forms of market risks 
foreign currency exchange rate risks we have global operations and thus make investments and enter into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies 
our operating results are impacted by buying  selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating companies 
wherever possible  we mitigate the impact by focusing on natural hedging techniques which include the following i structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flow subject to conversion risk  ii avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency and iii managing cash flows on a net basis both in timing and currency to minimize the exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
after considering natural hedging techniques  some portions of remaining exposure  especially for anticipated inter company and third party commercial transaction exposure in the short term  may be hedged using financial derivatives  such as foreign currency exchange rate forwards 
some of our foreign entities were party to foreign currency contracts for anticipated transactions in us dollars  british pounds  swedish krona  euros  south african rand  indian rupees and australian dollars at the end of in addition to the transactional exposure discussed above  our operating results are impacted by the translation of our foreign operating income into us dollars translation exposure 
we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate translation exposure 

table of contents risk from adverse movements in commodity prices we purchase certain raw materials  including steel and other metals  which are subject to price volatility caused by fluctuations in supply and demand as well as other factors 
to mitigate the impact of higher commodity prices we have consolidated our supply base and negotiated fixed price supply contracts with many of our commodity suppliers 
in addition  we continue to negotiate with our customers to provide for the sharing of increased raw material costs 
no assurances can be given that the magnitude and duration of increased commodity costs will not have a material impact on our future operating results 
we had no derivatives in place at december  to hedge commodity price movements 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk relates primarily to our floating rate exposure on borrowing under the amended exit facility 
under the terms of the exit facility we were required to enter into interest rate hedge agreements and to maintain agreements covering a notional amount of not less than of the aggregate loans outstanding under the term facility until january we have hedged interest on of the  outstanding at december  with an interest rate cap on the london interbank borrowing rate libor portion of the interest rate
