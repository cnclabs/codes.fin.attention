item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with our consolidated financial statements  the related notes to these financial statements  and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates  and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures  and markets medical devices and implants for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease 
our principal product offerings are sold throughout the world  primarily in the united states  the european union and  to a lesser extent  japan 
we estimate that the annual worldwide market addressed by our current product lines approaches billion and that the annual worldwide market for all peripheral vascular devices approximates billion  which we estimate had been growing at per year prior to the recent economic downturn 
we have used acquisitions as a primary means of further accessing the larger peripheral vascular device market  and we expect to continue to pursue this strategy in the future 
we currently manufacture most of our product lines in our burlington  massachusetts  headquarters  with the exceptions of the albograft vascular graft  which is manufactured at our facility in brindisi  italy  and the leveredge contrast injector and the remote endarterectomy suite of devices  for which manufacturing is outsourced 
our products are used by vascular surgeons who treat peripheral vascular disease through both open surgical methods and more recently adopted endovascular techniques 
in contrast to interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists  neither of whom are certified to perform open surgical procedures  vascular surgeons can perform both open surgical and minimally invasive endovascular procedures  and are therefore uniquely positioned to provide patients with a wider range of treatment options 
we believe that the purchasing volume of the vascular surgeon will increase and that the changing product needs of the vascular surgeon present us with attractive opportunities to sell new devices 
as a result  we have sought out and acquired new products and businesses that address these needs  and have pursued a strategy of selling directly to hospitals in our major markets 
in january we commenced distribution of the endologix powerlink system  an abdominal stent graft  in several european countries  including germany  france and the united kingdom 
we believe that this product complements our taarget thoracic stent graft and unifit abdominal stent graft product lines  allowing our european sales force to offer a complete range of stent grafts for the entire aorta 
in we extended this distribution agreement through december  
table of contents in april we acquired the business  operations  and substantially all of the assets of cardiovascular innovations  llc  which marketed a hand powered contrast injector  called the leveredge contrast injector  for use in a variety of endovascular procedures 
in september we acquired the business  operations and substantially all the of the assets of vascular architects  which marketed and sold devices used in remote endarterectomy  a hybrid open endovascular procedure for the minimally invasive removal of plaque  typically in the superficial femoral artery in the thigh 
in october we reached an agreement to launch a direct sales force in italy effective january prior to january  we had sold our products in italy through an exclusive distribution agreement with serom medical technologies  srl we and serom agreed in september to terminate serom s exclusive rights as of january   in exchange for a termination fee of approximately million 
serom had previously held exclusive distribution rights in italy from through the fourth quarter of in december we purchased certain patents and in process research and development from arizona heart innovative technologies  llc related to a pre commercial endovascular device 
in december we also acquired biomateriali  srl  a privately held italian company that manufactured the albograft vascular graft graft for vessel replacement in the peripherals  abdomen  and thorax 
biomateriali s manufacturing operations are located in brindisi  italy  and through its products were sold in europe under an exclusive distribution agreement with edwards lifesciences ag and an original equipment manufacturing arrangement with sorin biomedica spa 
in december we entered into an agreement with neovasc inc to distribute its biological patches for use in vascular surgery  including carotid endarterectomy  in the united states  the european union  and select other european markets 
this seven year agreement became effective january  we were also granted an option to acquire this product commencing in in march  we entered into a definitive agreement with edwards lifesciences to terminate its distribution of our albograft polyester prosthetic graft for vessel replacement in the peripherals  abdomen  and thorax 
we paid million to edward lifesciences in exchange for this early termination  the purchase of their albograft customer list  certain customer contracts and remaining albograft inventory  and their provision of sales and marketing services 
below is a listing of our product lines and product categories our endovascular product category includes our taarget thoracic stent graft  unifit abdominal stent graft  vascutape radiopaque tape  anastoclip vessel closure system  leveredge contrast injector  and aspire covered stent 
we also report the results of our distribution of the endologix powerlink system within this category 
our vascular product category includes our expandable lemaitre valvulotome  pruitt inahara and pruitt f carotid shunts  invisigrip vein stripper  lemaitre balloon catheters  and the five remote endarterectomy products which include our martin dissector  periscope dissector  endohelix retrieval device  mollring cutter transection device  and ring dissector  and the albograft vascular graft 
we also report the results of our distribution of the peripatch biologic vascular patch within this category 
our general surgery product category includes our reddick cholangiogram catheter and related accessories and optilock implantable port 
we evaluate the sales performance of our various product lines utilizing criteria that vary based upon the position of each product line in its expected life cycle 
for established products  we typically review unit sales and selling prices 
for faster growing products  we typically also focus upon new account generation and customer retention 

table of contents our business opportunities include the following the addition of complementary products through acquisition  the updating of existing products and introduction of new products through research and development  the long term growth of our sales force in north america  europe and japan  and the introduction of our products in new markets upon obtainment of regulatory approvals in these markets 
we are currently pursuing each of these opportunities 
to assist us in evaluating our business strategies  we regularly monitor long term technology trends in the peripheral vascular device market 
additionally  we consider the information obtained from discussions with the medical community in connection with the demand for our products  including potential new product launches 
we also use this information to help determine our competitive position in the peripheral vascular device market and our manufacturing capacity requirements 
we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force 
as of december   our sales force was comprised of sales representatives in north america  the european union and japan 
we also sell our products through a network of distributors in various countries outside of the united states and canada 
our worldwide headquarters are located in burlington  massachusetts 
our international operations are headquartered in sulzbach  germany 
we also have sales offices located in tokyo  japan  and rome  italy  and a manufacturing facility in brindisi  italy 
in  approximately of our net sales was generated through markets in which we employ direct sales representatives 
approximately of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro and the yen 
accordingly  our results of operations are influenced by changes in currency exchange rates 
increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar  as compared to other currencies in which our net sales are denominated  will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into us dollars for each fiscal period 
further  our strategy for growing our business includes the acquisition of complementary product lines and companies and occasionally the discontinuance of products or activities that are no longer complementary 
these actions may affect the comparability of our financial results from period to period and may cause substantial fluctuations period to period

in countries where we do not have a direct sales force  sales are primarily generated by shipments to distributors who  in turn  sell to hospitals and clinics 
in those cases where our products are held on consignment at a hospital or clinic  we generate sales at the time the product is used in surgery rather than at shipment

net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in sales in our endovascular product category increased by  while sales in our vascular and general surgery product categories grew by and  respectively  over the previous year 
new acquisitions and business development activities added to year over year sales growth  changes in foreign currency exchange rates added and organic sales increased 
sales increases were driven in part by the inclusion of our acquisitions excluding the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations of approximately million  higher average selling prices  the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of approximately million  and significant sales growth in various international markets  including the united kingdom  japan and france  and were partially offset by a decline in unit sales in several of our product lines 
due to volatility of the euro as compared to the dollar in we experienced significant changes throughout the year in the value of our sales in europe when translated into us dollars 
this volatility may continue into in addition  we expect that the early termination of our albograft distributor agreement with edwards lifesciences may reduce sales from our biomateriali subsidiary in the first quarter of net sales by geography 
net sales in the united states and canada increased to million in  as compared to million in the increase was driven primarily by the full year inclusion of our acquisitions of the leveredge contrast injector  aspire stent  and endore product lines  as well as higher average selling prices and strong results from our valvulotome and embolectomy catheter product lines 
net sales outside of the united states and canada increased to million for compared to million in the increase outside the united states and canada was driven primarily by growth within our endovascular product category which includes our next generation taarget and unifit stent grafts  the powerlink system  the inclusion of albograft vascular graft sales to edwards lifesciences  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of approximately million and strong results from our french  japanese and uk subsidiaries 
direct to hospital net sales represented of the total net sales outside the united states and canada in  as compared to in we believe that  in the near term  sales outside the united states and canada are likely to increase at a faster rate than sales inside the united states and canada due to our ability 
table of contents to sell our faster growing stent graft product lines in europe  the addition of the albograft product line to our european direct to hospital product offerings  and the likelihood that new product introductions  if and as they occur in  are likely to occur first in europe

gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the gross profit increase was driven primarily by greater net sales  higher average selling prices across several product categories  and favorable foreign currency fluctuations for the full year 
the improvement was partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies at our burlington manufacturing facility  the write off of million of excess and obsolete inventory largely related to product improvements related to our taarget and unifit stent grafts and our tt tortuous tracker delivery system  and the inclusion of biomateriali in our consolidated results 
gross profit in was negatively impacted by a million inventory charge in december related to the biomateriali acquisition 
the total gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in  compared with in the decrease from was largely a result of the inclusion of the albograft sales in  the write off of million of excess and obsolete inventory largely related to product improvements  and continued strength in the company s international business  partially offset by higher average selling prices across several product categories

general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of biomateriali in our consolidated results of million  as well as the addition of our french and italian direct sales efforts  which require local administrative support  and negative foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of million  and was partially offset by a decrease in the number of general and administrative personnel 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expense increased to million in from million in the increase was driven by increases in regulatory and clinical expenses and personnel costs  the inclusion of biomateriali in the consolidated results  increased royalties of million  higher product development costs largely related to the introduction of the tt delivery system  and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of million 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in process development costs 
we anticipate increased spending in research and development in as we continue to invest in product development and support our clinical trial efforts 
restructuring 
restructuring charges increased to million in from million in charges included million related to the early termination of our distributor in italy  and million related to our reductions in force in february and july 
expenses for included charges related to the buy out of our distributors in ireland and italy due to our decision to sell directly to hospitals in those countries 
we anticipate that we will incur significant restructuring charges in in connection with the early termination of our albograft vascular graft distribution agreement with edwards lifesciences 
purchased research and development 
in conjunction with a technology acquisition in december  we acquired in process research and development with a fair value of million that was expensed on the date of acquisition  as the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use to us at the date of acquisition 
this treatment is consistent with the aicpa practice guide  assets acquired in a business combination to be used in r d activities

losses on foreign currency exchange were due to a relative decrease in the strength of the euro as compared to the us dollar 
other income expense for was primarily due to losses on the disposal of capital equipment of  income tax expense 
we recorded a provision for taxes of million in compared to million in despite pre tax losses of million in and million in the provision was the result of a number of factors  including taxes on profits on certain of our foreign subsidiaries that are profitable  deferred tax liabilities related to the amortization of goodwill for us tax purposes  which cannot be used to reduce existing deferred tax assets  and effects of changes in uncertain tax positions 
we monitor the mix of profitability by tax jurisdiction and adjust our annual expected rate on a quarterly basis 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that the tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies 
tax reserves established include  but are not limited to transfer pricing and various state and foreign matters 
we provide a full valuation for net deferred tax assets  as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and deferred taxes will not be realized 
however  it is possible that the more likely than not criterion could be met at some time in the future which could result in the reversal of a significant portion or all of the valuation allowance  which  at that time  would be recorded as a tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations

we monitor the mix of profitability by tax jurisdiction and adjust our annual expected rate on a quarterly basis 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that the tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies 
tax reserves established include transfer pricing  withholding taxes  and various state and foreign audit matters  some of which may be resolved in the near future resulting in an adjustment to the reserve  which includes the results of our foreign subsidiaries 
we provide a full valuation for net deferred tax assets  as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and deferred taxes will not be realized

the weighted average maturity of the portfolio was months as of december   a reduction of months from december  as of december   our investment portfolio included million of asset backed securities collateralized by first lien mortgages  credit card debt  and auto loans 
in order to limit our credit risk exposure  we reduced our asset backed securities holdings in by million  from million as of december  in the event of a temporary decline in market value  we have the intent and ability to hold our debt investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested 
in  we recognized a loss of million related to a single asset backed security in our portfolio which experienced an other than temporary decline in market value 
we continually monitor the asset allocation of our holdings in an attempt to mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures  and we intend to continue to closely 
table of contents monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as necessary 
although the highly unusual degree of volatility in the current global financial markets can affect the marketability of selected securities  we do not anticipate that these events will result in significant portfolio liquidity limitations or write downs  although we can make no assurances to this effect 
we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures  and pay our long term liabilities 
since our inception  we have funded our operations through private placements of equity securities  short term borrowings  and funds generated from our operations 
in october we completed our initial public offering of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
we sold  shares and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commission of approximately million 
we also incurred approximately million of additional expenses associated with our initial public offering of which we had paid approximately million prior to completing our initial public offering

our cash balances may decrease as we continue to use cash to fund our operations  make acquisitions  and make deferred payments related to prior acquisitions 
in  we expect to use million to fund deferred acquisition payments and million for the early termination of our albograft distributor relationship with edwards lifesciences 
in august we amended our revolving line of credit with brown brothers harriman co 
as a result of this amendment  our borrowing capacity increased to million and the maximum principal amount of any letters of credit issued as part of this facility increased to million 
in august  the maturity date for amounts borrowed was extended to august loans made under this revolving line of credit bear interest at libor plus basis points or the bank s base rate  at our discretion 
borrowings under this line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
as of december   we had no borrowing outstanding under this line of credit 
the loan agreement requires that we meet certain financial and operating covenants 
as of december  we were in compliance with these covenants 
our credit facility is scheduled to expire in august  and in view of the current economic environment  which has negatively impacted the credit markets  there can be no assurance that our facility will be renewed on terms that are acceptable to us or at all

in we expect to pay approximately million of non contingent deferred purchase price obligations related to the biomateriali acquisition 
net cash used in financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was  in this was primarily due to the repayment of the revolving line of credit at our italian subsidiary of million  and offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of common stock options and our employee purchase plan of million 
we recognized a net operating profit of  and  for the three months ended september  and december   respectively  however  we recognized an operating loss of million for the year ended december  although it is our intention to continue to generate an operating profit  excluding the impact of strategic acquisitions and distributor terminations  there can be no assurance that we will not generate a net operating loss in the future due to our continued investment in growing our business 
we expect to fund any increased costs and expenditures from our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  though  our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the revenues generated by sales of our products  the costs associated with expanding our manufacturing  marketing  sales  and distribution efforts  the rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities  litigation  the costs of obtaining and maintaining fda and other regulatory clearances of our products and products in development  the effects of competing technological and market developments  the costs associated with being a public company  including consulting expenses associated with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and the number  timing  and nature of acquisitions and other strategic transactions

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may require additional funds in order to make acquisitions 
we may seek financing of future cash needs through the sale of equity securities and issuance of debt 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  such financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our business operations or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if additional funds are obtained by issuing equity or debt securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur

our most significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  sales returns and discounts  and income taxes are reviewed on an ongoing basis and updated as appropriate 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry  and information provided by physicians who use our products and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates and related accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our most 
table of contents critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements 
those financial estimates and related policies include revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally use customer purchase orders or contracts to determine the existence of an arrangement 
substantially all sales transactions are based on prices that are determinable at the time that the customer s purchase order is accepted by us 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we would defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we provide for product returns at the time revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  based on our historical return product history 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable are with customers based in the us and internationally 
accounts receivable generally are due within to days of invoice and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  other than in certain european markets where longer payment terms are customary 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the current creditworthiness of the customers  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor aging reports  collections  and payments from customers  and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues we identify 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and allowances  we cannot guarantee the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
the provision for the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in general and administrative expenses 
inventory inventory consists of finished products  work in process  and raw materials 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
cost includes materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead and is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast  which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate  and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
stock based compensation through december   we measured employee stock based compensation expense using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no  
table of contents or fin   accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  and related interpretations 
for stock options granted to employees  no compensation expense was recognized unless the exercise price was less than the estimated fair value  for financial reporting purposes 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of share based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires nonpublic companies that used the minimum value method in sfas no 
for either recognition or pro forma disclosures to apply sfas no 
r using the prospective transition method 
as such  we will continue to apply apb in future periods to equity awards outstanding at the date of sfas no 
r s adoption that were measured using the minimum value method 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these stock based awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we estimate expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the expected lives of the options were estimated using the simplified method for plain vanilla options 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation 
the compensation expense recognized for all stock based awards is net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures 
stock based compensation charges will be adjusted in future periods to reflect the results of actual forfeitures and vesting 
for the year ended december   we recorded expense of approximately million in connection with share based payment awards 
the future expense of non vested options of approximately million is to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we account for stock based compensation expense for non employees using the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
 as continued by sfas r and the black scholes option pricing model  and record the fair value  for financial reporting purposes  of non employee stock options as an expense over either the vesting term of the option or the service period 
in  we issued stock options to two of our executive officers for the purchase of an aggregate of  shares and to one of these executive officers an award of an additional  shares of our common stock 
the options and award were subject to restricted stock agreements that provided us the right to purchase  and the executive officers with the right to cause us to purchase  these shares 
the purchase right features of these agreements terminated upon the completion of our initial public offering in october we accounted for these options and award until using variable plan accounting since the exercise of the employee repurchase price was considered likely based on the lack of marketability of our common stock 
after reviewing a variety of factors  we subsequently determined that the likelihood of either us or these executive officers exercising these purchase options was remote 
consequently  subsequent to we have accounted for these options and award using fixed plan accounting 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  based on the use of the prospective method of adoption  these options and this award will continue to be accounted for under apb no 
as fixed plan arrangements 
concurrently with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we applied the guidance included in accounting series release no 
and emerging issues task force no 
d with respect to the redemption feature related to these options and award 
the effect of the adoption resulted in the classification of the intrinsic value of the redemption feature of million at january   from retained earnings to other than permanent equity 
during  the value of the redemption feature increased by million to million  which was charged against retained earnings 
the repurchase and call right features terminated upon the completion of our public offering of our common stock resulting in a million credit to additional paid in capital 
prior to our initial public offering there was no public market for our common stock  and in connection with our issuance of stock options the fair value for our common stock was estimated by our board of directors  with input from management 
our board of directors exercised judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our 
table of contents common stock on the date of grant based on several factors  including transactions in our common stock  key milestones achieved in our business  and both historical and forecasted net sales 
in the absence of a contemporaneous arms length transaction  our board typically estimated the fair value of our common stock based upon an enterprise valuation determined by multiplying our trailing six months of net sales by two  and then multiplying that amount by four 
we believed this to be a reasonable methodology based upon our internal peer company analyses and based on several arms length transactions involving our common stock supportive of the results produced by this valuation methodology 
we have not historically obtained contemporaneous valuations by an unrelated valuation specialist because  at the time of the issuances of stock options  we believed our estimates of the fair value of our common stock to be reasonable and consistent with our understanding of how similarly situated companies in our industry are valued 
as disclosed more fully in the notes of our financial statements  during we granted stock options at a weighted average exercise price of and restricted stock units with fair value weighted average price of 
valuation of goodwill  other intangibles when we acquire a business  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  among acquired tangible net assets  identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill as required by us gaap 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of the acquired businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists 
we evaluate the december balance of the carrying value of goodwill based on a single reporting unit annually and more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
the first step of our goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and thus the second step of the impairment test  used to measure the amount of the impairment loss  is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill as of the date of the impairment review with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of our goodwill is determined on the same basis as the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with a business combination 
specifically  we allocate the fair value of our reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination as of the date of the impairment review and as if the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we have determined that no impairment charges were required during the year ended december  the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  principally related to the determination that we operate as a single reporting unit and the estimated far value of that reporting unit 
historically  the market capitalization of the company as a whole has exceeded the carrying amount  and on that basis we concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
at december   the market capitalization of the company was less than the carrying amount 
we therefore used a market approach to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  including a control premium that an investor would pay to obtain control of the company 
the significant assumptions utilized in the market approach include the determination of appropriate market comparables  the estimated multiples of revenue a willing buyer is likely to pay  and the estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 
based on these estimates  we concluded that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount  and therefore goodwill was not impaired 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions we used are reasonable and supportable  the use of different estimates or assumptions could have resulted in a different conclusion 
goodwill was million as of december   and million as of december  
table of contents other intangible assets consist primarily of purchased developed technology  patents  customer relationships  and trademarks and are amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from five to years 
we review intangible assets quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist for a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment 
conditions that may indicate impairment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of the asset  a change in the operating cash flows associated with the asset  or adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset  we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified 
we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets  we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions  cost structures  and remaining useful lives of the asset 
these estimates and assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million as of december   and million as of december  we recognized impairment charges on our intangible assets of million in contingencies in the normal course of business  we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  and other claims and assessments for matters related to  among other things  patent infringement  business acquisitions  employment  and product recalls 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
we record charges for the costs we anticipate incurring in connection with litigation and claims against us when we determine a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate these costs 
during the years ended december    and  we were not subject to any material litigation  claims or assessments 
restructuring we record restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation or relocation of operations  exited business lines  or shutdowns of specific sites 
these restructuring charges  which reflect our commitment to a termination or exit plan that will begin within twelve months  are based on estimates of the expected costs associated with site closure  legal matters  contract terminations  or other costs directly related to the restructuring 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an additional charge to earnings will result 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a credit to earnings will be recognized 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from taxable income during the carryback period or in the future  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we do not provide for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  as our current intention is to permanently reinvest these earnings 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin on january  fin clarifies the accounting and reporting for 
table of contents uncertainties in income tax law 
this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation  and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within the united states and outside of the united states and may be subject to audits from various tax authorities regarding transfer pricing  the deductibility of certain expenses  intercompany transactions  and other matters 
within specific countries  we may be subject to audit by various tax authorities operating within the country and may be subject to different statutes of limitation expiration dates 
management s judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  liabilities for uncertain tax positions  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of million in and million in marketable securities we account for our investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
our investments consist primarily of marketable debt securities and us government securities  and are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair market value at december  the unrealized gains losses on available for sale securities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents  and investments with original maturities of greater than days to be short term investments 
when a marketable security incurs a significant unrealized loss for a sustained period of time  we review the instrument to determine if it is other than temporarily impaired 
if we conclude an instrument is other than temporarily impaired  we record the unrealized loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign exchange fluctuations and interest rates  which could impact our results of operations and financial position 
we do not currently engage in any hedging or other market risk management tools  and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro  could adversely affect our financial results 
for the year ended december   approximately of our sales were denominated in foreign currencies 
we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our sales in the future 
selling  marketing  and administrative costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currency  thereby partially mitigating our transaction risk exposure 
we therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is moderated 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases and if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our price not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
the majority of sales recorded in foreign currencies for the year ended december  were denominated in the euro 
our principal exchange rate risk therefore exists between the us dollar and the euro 
fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the re measurement of our foreign currency denominated receivables and payables  generating currency transaction gains or losses that impact our non operating income expense levels in the respective period and are reported in other income expense  net in our consolidated financial statements 
we recorded million foreign currency loss and million foreign currency gain for the years ended december  and  respectively  related mainly to the re measurement of our foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we may  however  hedge such exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related primarily to our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio includes fixed rate debt instruments of the us government and corporate issuers and consists primarily of short term investments 
the primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields 
a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of our investments to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing rate rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  investments are generally held to maturity 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
credit risk 
in addition to a decline in interest rates  other economic variables  such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk  could result in a decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio 
the majority of our marketable securities have remaining maturities of two years or less 
our investment portfolio includes million of asset back securities collateralized by first lien mortgages  credit card debt  and auto loans 
we did not hold any auction rated securities in our investment portfolio as of december  in the event of a temporary decline in market value  we have the intent and ability to hold our debt investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested 
we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures in accordance with our policies 
we intend to continue to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as deemed necessary 
based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio  we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of the current credit environment
