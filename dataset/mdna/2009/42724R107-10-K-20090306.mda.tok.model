tract multi family commercial hospitality total construction land at december   land balances were approximately million higher than that reported at december  the year over year increase within this category can be attributed to the funding of six loans in excess of million in the aggregate amount of million 
two of the largest loans within this category consist of loans for residential tract developments in the aggregate amount of million 
these projects are located in kern county of the california central valley 
one project is approved for single family lots 
this project has also been approved for approximately acres of commercial development and acres for recreational purposes 
the project was funded in the first quarter of and has an approximate loan to value of  based on an appraisal conducted earlier in the year 
at december  the balance of this loan was approximately million  with approximately million un disbursed 
the purpose of the second project is to provide affordable housing to a market that generally consists of renters and is the only new housing development in its area 
this loan funded in march at approximately million and has subsequently been paid down by approximately million from proceeds of sold homes 
the borrower is actively marketing the remaining finished homes and sales continue to occur at a rate of one to two homes per month 
additionally  the housing in this project qualifies for the usda direct loan program whereby individuals or families receive financial assistance directly from the housing and community facilities programs hcfp in the form of a home loan at an affordable interest rate 
as of december   these loans were performing under the contractual terms of their respective loan agreements 
kern county  somewhat outside of the company s market footprint  has a population of approximately  and depends on agriculture  oil  light industry  warehousing and distribution  and educational services to support its economy 
this region of california s central valley has experienced significant population growth over the last five years relative to other areas of the state  with annual percentage increases of or more per year over the last five years 
affordable housing  relative to other metropolitan areas within california  has been a significant factor behind the growth in kern county s population 
however  like many other areas within california  real estate prices within the california central valley have fallen significantly  with recent indications showing year over year declines of approximately and an approximate six month supply of unsold homes within kern county  specifically 
management acknowledges that as economic conditions worsen across the state  the level of growth previously experienced within the california central valley will no doubt be negatively impacted 
as such  management continues to carefully monitor loans made to borrowers in the central valley for any sign of deterioration

the bank typically makes such loans to borrowers within the bank s primary market area 
loans held for sale at december  loans held for sale were approximately million higher than that reported at december  the year over year increase can be attributed in part to the strong demand the bank has seen for mortgage re financing given the dramatic decline in interest rates during foreign loans at december   the bank had no foreign loans outstanding

summary of market condition the residential real estate market came under significant pressure during and remained under considerable pressure throughout the market was negatively impacted by rising interest rates during the majority of  negative sentiment surrounding market values of real estate  an over supply of newly constructed homes and inflationary pressures 
additionally  as conditions in the credit markets worsened during the later half of and into  financial institutions became more reluctant to extend new credit to borrowers  pushing the cost of certain types of credit higher in a rates down environment and contributing further to the decline in real estate prices 
as more and more home owners began to see interest rate resets on adjustable rate mortgages late in and into  the number of non performing loans and defaults rose significantly in the industry as a whole 
as we moved further into  the credit markets came under increasingly intense pressure  specifically during the third and fourth quarters 
this was fueled in part by a widespread lack of confidence in the us financial system  which led many financial institutions to further tighten the extension of new credit given concerns over the lack of liquidity  asset quality  and the conservation of capital 
contributing significantly to the troubles seen in the housing market and us financial system have been a weakened economy and consequently higher levels of unemployment  placing considerable pressure on the us consumer s ability to satisfy their outstanding obligations to the financial sector 
the company believes these factors have contributed greatly to the increased level of non performing assets the bank experienced during sales of single family homes have fallen significantly year over year in the company s market area and california as a whole  with recent indications showing price declines of approximately statewide and to within the company s market area 
along with other segments in the real estate sector  commercial real estate prices in the company s market area experienced some pressure during and the company has begun to see a slight increase in vacancy rates in certain retail and office segments  though not to any considerable extent 
during the demand for business and professional properties in the company s market area remained relatively strong  with low vacancies  competitive loan rates  and many investors seeking exchange properties 
this helped to provide some insulation against a significant downturn in prices as well as the volume of sales 
however  the company realizes that any prolonged and significant downturn in the national and local economies will have an impact on the values of commercial real estate within its market footprint as well as the borrowers to whom the bank has extended such credit and thus continues to closely monitor the credits within this segment of the loan portfolio for potential signs of deterioration 
additionally  the bank is aware that as economic conditions worsen and levels of unemployment continue to rise  borrowers to whom the bank has extended commercial lines of credit may come under additional pressure to satisfy their outstanding obligations 
that said  the bank continues to employ stringent lending standards and remains very selective with regard to any additional commercial real estate  real estate construction  land and commercial loans it chooses to originate in an effort to effectively manage risk in this difficult credit environment 
although  the company s market footprint has historically enjoyed a more stable level of economic growth  we are not completely immune to the effects of a slowdown on a state or national level 
as previously mentioned  with the availability of credit significantly diminished and the effects of a weakened economy placing more pressure on borrowers  the ability of consumers to satisfy outstanding obligations to the financial sector  as a whole  has begun to languish 
we believe that within certain areas of our local economy these more macro level concerns have started to become more evident  specifically with respect to real estate development in the single family residential market 
this has no doubt had an impact on the level of and type of loans the bank has placed on non accrual and charged off during additionally  the company has devoted considerable resources to the monitoring of credits within the loan portfolio in order to take any appropriate steps when and if necessary to mitigate any material adverse impact the slowing of the single family residential and commercial real estate markets may have on the bank overall 
capitalization rates  the rate at which a stream of cash flows are discounted to find their present value  for the last three years were as follows to in  to in  and to in non performing assets the bank s management is responsible for monitoring loan performance  which is done through various methods  including a review of loan delinquencies and personal knowledge of customers 
additionally  the bank maintains both a watch list of loans that  for a variety of reasons  management believes require regular review as well as an internal loan classification process 
semi annually  the loan portfolio is also reviewed by an experienced  outside loan reviewer not affiliated with the bank 
a list of delinquencies  the watch list  internal loan classifications and the outside loan review are reviewed regularly by the bank s board of directors 
management acknowledges that due to negative undertones associated with the economy and real estate markets  the internal watch list expanded during while credit quality is consistently monitored  management has implemented additional precautionary actions that include but are not limited to pro actively identifying credit weaknesses earlier in the collection cycle  increasing the oversight frequency of watch list credits and devoting additional internal resources to monitor those credits 
although the bank believes these actions will serve to potentially minimize any future losses the bank may incur related to problem loans  we cannot guarantee that the bank will not experience an increase in non performing loans  given continued uncertainties surrounding the state and national economies as well the us financial system 
the bank has a non accrual policy that requires a loan greater than days past due and or is specifically determined to be impaired to be placed on non accrual status unless such loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection 
when loans are placed on non accrual status  all accrued but uncollected interest income is reversed from earnings 
once on non accrual status payments received on such loans are applied as a reduction of the loan principal balance 
interest on a loan is only recognized on a cash basis and is generally not recognized on specific impaired loans unless the likelihood of further loss is remote 
loans may be returned to accrual status if management believes that all remaining principal and interest is fully collectible and there has been at least six months of sustained repayment performance since the loan was placed on non accrual 
if a loan s credit quality deteriorates to the point that collection of principal is believed by management to be doubtful and the value of collateral securing the obligation is sufficient the bank generally takes steps to protect and liquidate the collateral 
any loss resulting from the difference between the loan balance and the fair market value of the collateral is recognized by a charge to the allowance for loan losses 
when collateral is held for sale after foreclosure  it is subject to a periodic appraisal 
if the appraisal indicates that the collateral will sell for less than its recorded value  the bank recognizes the loss by a charge to non interest expense

investment securities securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with related unrealized net gains or losses  net of deferred income taxes  recorded as an adjustment to equity capital 
at december  the securities portfolio had net unrealized losses  net of taxes of approximately million 
at december   the securities portfolio had a net unrealized gain of thousand 
the year over year decline in the fair value of the securities portfolio is primarily attributable to the extreme market turbulence the credit markets experienced during  placing pressure on holdings within the portfolio 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the credit markets came under significant duress as investor and consumer confidence in the us financial system became significantly destabilized 
as a result  many financial institutions in severe need of liquidity were forced to de leverage for a variety of reasons  selling significant portions of their investment holdings which in turn placed considerable pressure on the values of many classes of investment securities 
in particular  mortgage related securities came under substantial pressure and the bank s portfolio was not completely immune to this 
although substantially all of the bank s mortgage related securities are considered investment grade  overall lack of confidence in the housing market  the inability of many consumers to meet their mortgage related obligations  and the strong need for liquidity during have  among other things  been influential in placing pressure on the prices of these types of securities 
at december   the balance of the investment portfolio was approximately million or million higher than that reported at december  although the values of certain securities within the portfolio declined in the face of considerable market turbulence  purchases the bank made during in the approximate amount of million  offset by principal payments  maturities and calls in the aggregate amount of million  contributed to the overall increase in the balance of the portfolio 
as part of the acquisition of business first  the bank acquired five whole loan cmo securities with a remaining principle balance of approximately million 
the bank performed an extensive review of the underlying collateral for these securities  including but not limited to updates on credit enhancements  loan to values  credit scores  delinquency rates and default rates 
as of december   these securities had a remaining principal balance of approximately million and a net unrealized loss of approximately million 
at december   the bank had a total of nine whole loan cmo holdings with a remaining principal balance of approximately million and a net unrealized loss of approximately million  contributing significantly to the year over year decline in the overall market value of the portfolio 
the bank continues to perform extensive analyses on the underlying tranches associated with all of these securities 
by analyzing the tranche separate from the mother security  the bank has determined that there is no impairment and as such  is not taking any action to write down these securities 
these investment securities continue to demonstrate cash flows as expected and the credit support component of these tranches has actually increased from the origination date 
as of december   management does not believe the loss in market value of these securities is other than temporary 
the majority of the bank s mortgage securities  other than those discussed in the preceding paragraph were issued by the government national mortgage association ginnie mae  the federal national mortgage association fannie mae  and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac 
these securities carry the guarantee of the issuing agencies 
all fixed and adjustable rate mortgage pools contain a certain amount of risk related to the uncertainty of prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
interest rate changes have a direct impact upon prepayment rates 
the bank uses computer simulation models to test the average life  duration  market volatility and yield volatility of adjustable rate mortgage pools under various interest rate assumptions to monitor volatility

although the balance of federal funds sold can vary significantly from day to day as a result of many factors  including the liquidity needs of our depositors  the year over year decline is also attributable to lower deposit balances during and fewer excess funds available for short term over night investment

as indicated in the tables above  total deposit balances at december  were approximately million 
this represents a decline of approximately million compared to the million reported at the end of lower balances of non interest bearing demand  money market and time deposits contributed significantly to the year over year declines 
presented many challenges to the bank with respect to the gathering of core deposits 
as conditions in the credit markets and economic environment worsened  many financial institutions in severe need of liquidity began to engage in somewhat irrational deposit pricing  contributing to some run off in core as well as non core promotional deposit balances 
management chose not to engage in this type of pricing and instead chose to seek funding from other sources such as the federal home loan bank fhlb and brokered deposits in an effort to not only maintain our net interest margin  but to maintain a deposit base based on customer relationship 
at december   the funds the bank considers to be brokered represented approximately million or of total deposits 
the balance of these funds consisted of million in time deposits and million in money market balances 
for the year ended december   the weighted average rate the bank paid for these funds was core deposits demand  savings and money market  exclusive of brokered funds gathered in the local communities served by the bank continue to be the primary source of funds for loans and investments 
at december   core deposits represented approximately million or of total deposits 
this when compared to the million balance at december   represents a decline of approximately million 
the majority of the year over year decline can be attributed to run off of promotional money market balances in favor of somewhat irrational offering rates with other financial institutions 
as previously mentioned  the bank has chosen to pursue other sources of funding to a certain degree in light of the declines we have seen in core balances in an effort to protect the net interest margin and maintain a healthy deposit base based on relationship 
deposit balances at december  were million or approximately million higher than that reported at december  the increase in deposit balances in can be attributed to the acquisition of business first as well as promotions the bank engaged in during designed to attract lower cost core deposits in order to fund the strong loan growth the bank saw during the first half of that year  as well as to pay down higher cost federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings at that time 
during  money market account balances increased approximately million 
exclusive of the acquisition of business first  money market accounts increased approximately million  directly related to the bank s promotional activities

accounts may be added to or removed from the volatile liability dependency report when  based on management s judgment  it is determined that these funds are not suitable for any form of long term investment or that risk associated with these types of funds leaving the bank has become minimal 
of the million in volatile deposits reported at december   approximately million or can be attributed to four particular relationships 
the following provides a summary of the notable relationships that comprise the majority of volatile deposit balances as of december  volatile non interest bearing demand accounts represent relationships where the depositors engage in mortgage related activities 
these balances declined approximately million from the end of pressures on the mortgage industry for the majority of and have had a direct impact on the balance of these accounts 
management and the board of directors of the bank are aware that as conditions in the mortgage market change  these relationships may continue to be impacted 
the majority of interest bearing demand deposits the bank considers to be volatile are held by two depositors one of which represents public funds 
the majority of money market deposits the bank considers to be volatile were held by one depositor 
the year over year decline in the balance of this account contributed substantially to the year over year decline in total volatile balances within this category 
at december   the bank was aware that balances associated with this one particular relationship would experience ongoing declines due to the customer s intention to invest in other vehicles and also make tax payments 
borrowed funds the bank has a variety of sources from which it may obtain secondary funding 
these sources include  among others  the federal home loan bank fhlb  credit lines established with correspondent banks and brokered funds 
at december   fhlb borrowings were million or approximately million higher than that reported at december  the dramatic year over year increase in fhlb borrowing can be attributed to the funding of loan growth  the purchase of investment securities and the decision by management to let higher cost deposits run off in favor of irrational deposit pricing at other financial institutions 
at december   the bank s remaining capacity to borrow from the fhlb was approximately million 
additionally  on september   the bank issued a letter of credit in the amount of approximately million  which has since been reduced to million  to a customer in regard to a senior care facility 
the letter of credit was issued pursuant to a letter of credit reimbursement agreement between the bank and the fhlb 
it is collateralized by a blanket lien with the fhlb that includes all qualifying loans on the bank s balance sheet

capital ratios for commercial banks in the united states are generally calculated using three different formulas 
these calculations are referred to as the leverage ratio and two risk based calculations known as tier one risk based capital ratio and the total risk based capital ratio 
these standards were developed through joint efforts of banking authorities from different countries around the world 
the standards essentially take into account the fact that different types of assets have different levels of risk associated with them 
furthermore  they take into account the off balance sheet exposures of banks when assessing capital adequacy 
the leverage ratio calculation simply divides common stockholders equity reduced by any goodwill a bank may have by the total assets of the bank 
in the tier one risk based capital ratio  the numerator is the same as the leverage ratio  but the denominator is the total risk weighted assets of the bank 
risk weighted assets are determined by segregating all the assets and off balance sheet exposures into different risk categories and weighting them by a percentage ranging from lowest risk to highest risk 
the total risk based capital ratio  again  uses risk weighted assets in the denominator  but expands the numerator to include other capital items besides equity such as a limited amount of the loan loss reserve  long term capital debt  preferred stock and other instruments 
summarized below are the company s and the bank s capital ratios at december  and regulatory standard december  december  adequately well heritage oaks heritage oaks ratio capitalized capitalized bancorp bank bancorp bank leverage ratio tier i capital to risk weighted assets total risk based capital to risk weighted assets liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the continuous availability of funds to meet the demands of depositors  investors and borrowers 
asset liquidity is primarily derived from loan payments and the maturity of other earning assets 
liquidity from liabilities is obtained primarily from the receipt of new deposits 
the bank s asset liability committee alco is responsible for managing the on and off balance sheet commitments to meet the needs of customers while achieving the bank s financial objectives 
alco meets regularly to assess the projected funding requirements by reviewing historical funding patterns  current and forecasted economic conditions and individual customer funding needs 
deposits generated from the bank s customers serve as the primary source of liquidity 
the bank has credit arrangements with correspondent banks that serve as a secondary liquidity source 
at december   these credit lines totaled million and the bank had no borrowings against those lines 
as previously mentioned  the bank is a member of the fhlb and has collateralized borrowing capacities remaining of million at december  the bank manages liquidity by maintaining a majority of the investment portfolio in federal funds sold and other liquid investments 
the majority of these investments include obligations of state and political subdivisions municipal bonds and mortgage related securities that provide a relatively steady stream of cash flows 
as of december  the company believes investments in the portfolio can be liquidated at their current fair values in the event they are needed to provide liquidity 
as previously mentioned  a line of credit in the amount of million with one of the bank s correspondent banks was temporarily suspended due to the instability of the financial markets during the fourth quarter 
this particular correspondent bank determined it needed to re assess all lines of credit extended to other banks 
the bank is in the process of providing updated agreements and expects the line to be re activated within the first quarter of if not  the bank has been solicited by other correspondent banks to provide a similar credit arrangement

as a result of these challenging market conditions  many banks experienced considerable liquidity constraints  increases in the cost of certain types of borrowing  and increased pressures on deposit pricing in efforts to retain core funding balances 
although the bank did not experience any significant liquidity constraints during  extremely competitive deposit pricing at other financial institutions in severe need of liquidity have posed significant challenges to the bank in our effort to attract and retain core deposits 
however  the bank believes its considerable availability of secondary funding sources combined with its ability to re price deposits  if so needed  provides ample liquidity to continue to meet the needs of its depositors  investors and borrowers 
at december   the ratio of liquid assets not pledged for collateral and other purposes to deposits and other liabilities was compared to in the ratio of net loans to deposits ltd  another key liquidity ratio  was at december  compared to at december  both of which are and were within the bank s policy guidelines 
while the bank still provides the majority of loan funding with core deposits  due to the highly competitive nature of deposit gathering and given the current economic environment  the bank has found it necessary to rely on borrowed funds from time to time 
with the banking industry s common use of alternative funding sources  ie fhlb borrowing  the bank implemented a tracking ratio of loan to funding ltf in this ratio is calculated by dividing gross loans by the sum of total deposits and alternative funding sources both available and used 
at december  and  the ltf ratio was and 
the bank s key focus has been and remains to increase core deposits and minimize alternative funding sources 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are integral to understanding the company s financial condition and results of operations 
accounting policies management considers to be significant are disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements filed on this form k 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of interest income and interest expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
virtually all of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are located at the banking subsidiary level 
thus  virtually all of the company s interest rate risk exposure lies at the banking subsidiary level other than million in subordinated debentures issued by the company s subsidiary grantor trusts 
as a result  all significant interest rate risk procedures are performed at the banking subsidiary level 
the subsidiary bank s real estate loan portfolio  concentrated primarily within santa barbara and san luis obispo counties  of california  are subject to risks associated with the local economy 
the fundamental objective behind the management of the company s assets and liabilities is to maximize the company s economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and an exposure to interest rate risk deemed by management to be acceptable 
management believes an acceptable degree of exposure to interest rate risk results from the management of assets and liabilities through maturities  pricing and mix to attempt to neutralize the potential impact of changes in market interest rates 
the company s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets re price differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity and coordinating its sources and uses of funds 
the company seeks to control interest rate risk exposure in a manner that will allow for adequate levels of earnings and capital over a range of possible interest rate environments 
the company has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure 
management believes historically it has effectively managed the effect of changes in interest rates on its operating results 
management believes that it can continue to manage the short term effect of interest rate changes under various interest rate scenarios 
management employs the use of an asset and liability management software that is used to measure the bank s exposure to future changes in interest rates 
this model measures the expected cash flows and re pricing of each financial asset liability separately in measuring the bank s interest sensitivity 
based on the results of this model  management believes the bank s balance sheet is asset sensitive 
the company generally expects expansion in its net interest income if rates rise and expects  conversely  contraction if rates fall 
the level of potential or expected contraction indicated by the tables below is considered acceptable by management and is compliant with the bank s alco policies 
management will continue to perform this analysis each quarter to further validate the expected results against actual data 
the hypothetical impacts of sudden interest rate movements applied to the company s asset and liability balances are modeled monthly 
the results of this movement indicate how much of the company s net interest income is at risk from various rate changes over a one year horizon 
this exercise is valuable in identifying risk exposures 
the results for the company s december  balances indicate that the net interest income at risk over a one year time horizon for a and rate increase and decrease are within the company s policy guidelines for such changes 
rate shock scenarios dollar amounts in thousands bp bp base bp bp net interest income nii change from base change from base it is important to note that the above table is a summary of several forecasts and actual results may vary 
the forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions of management that may turn out to be different and may change over time 
factors affecting these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to competitor behavior  economic conditions both locally and nationally  actions taken by the federal reserve board  customer behavior and management s responses 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions and estimates may have significant effects on the company s net interest income  therefore  the results of this analysis should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
the following table provides a summary of the loans the bank can expect to see come off their floors if the prime rate were to increase by the amounts presented as of december  move in prime rate bps dollar amounts in thousands variable daily variable other than daily cumulative total variable at floor as evidenced in the table above  the bank can expect to see approximately million in loans come off their floors if the prime rate were to increase by basis points as of december  the following table provides a summary for loans that currently possess a fixed rate or are at their floors as of december  percent of dollar amounts in thousands balances gross loans fixed rate variable daily floor variable other than daily floor total fixed floor as evidenced in the table above  approximately million or of loans in the portfolio are either fixed or at their floor 
the company also attempts to quantify the impact of interest rate changes on borrowers ability to pay on loans and the impact of similar rate changes on the value of collateral held against loans 
to this end  the company  from time to time  will sample loans and analyze them under a rate shock scenario to specifically assess the impact of the rate shock on financial ratios such as interest rate coverage and loan to value 
the results of the analysis have generally revealed that in the case of such a rate shock  a high percentage of loans tested would continue to express ratios within current underwriting guidelines 
the results of these analyses are considered acceptable by management
