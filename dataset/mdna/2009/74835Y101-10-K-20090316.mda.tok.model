item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as those discussed in any documents incorporated by reference herein or therein 
when used in this annual report  the terms questcor  company  we  our  ours and us refer to questcor pharmaceuticals  inc and its consolidated subsidiary 
overview we market hp acthar gel repository corticotropin injection  an injectable drug that is approved for the treatment of certain disorders with an inflammatory component  including the treatment of exacerbations associated with multiple sclerosis ms  and the treatment of nephrotic syndrome 
hp acthar gel acthar is not indicated for  but is also used in treating patients with infantile spasms is  a rare form of refractory childhood epilepsy  and opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome  a rare autoimmune related childhood neurological disorder 
we also market doral quazepam  which is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep  frequent nocturnal awakenings  and or early morning awakenings 
in august  we announced our acthar centric business strategy  which included a new pricing level for acthar effective august  the strategy was adopted in order to best position acthar to benefit patients  advance our product development programs and ensure that the company become economically viable 
since the adoption of the strategy  we have expanded our sponsorship of acthar patient assistance and co pay assistance programs  which provide an important safety net for uninsured and under insured patients using acthar  and have established a group of product service consultants and medical science liaisons to work with healthcare providers who administer acthar 
we have provided free acthar with a commercial value of over million to uninsured and under insured patients 
in addition to the free drug program  we have provided significant financial support to patients through the co pay assistance program of the national organization for rare disorders nord 
as a result of these efforts  we are not aware of a single patient who needed acthar but was not able to access it 
this was not the case before our strategy change 
because we are now economically viable  we have significantly improved our ability to maintain the long term availability of acthar and fund important medical research projects that have the goal of improving patient care  despite the deterioration of the current us economic environment 
we have been working closely with the neurology community to identify promising new projects for which we can provide needed financial support 
we are providing support to leading researchers in their efforts to better understand the underlying disease processes that cause infantile spasms  a subject for which there has been little research funding in recent decades 
we are also in discussions with experts in other disease states with high unmet medical needs for which there is a potential therapeutic role for acthar 
as a result of these initiatives  which have been made possible by our change in strategy  we expect to fund more than a dozen new pre clinical and clinical studies in we are also exploring conducting development efforts  or financing the development efforts of third parties  of additional pharmaceutical products addressing serious  rare conditions with unmet medical needs 
acthar is currently approved in the us for the treatment of exacerbations associated with ms  nephrotic syndrome and many other conditions with an inflammatory component 
pursuant to guidelines published by the american academy of neurology and the child neurology society  many child neurologists use acthar to treat infants afflicted with is even though it is not approved for this indication 
we are continuing to pursue a supplemental new drug application snda to the us food and drug administration fda to add the treatment of is to the list of approved indications on the acthar label 
if the submission is accepted for filing by the fda  we anticipate that the fda may take final action on the snda in late  though there can be no assurance as to the actual timetable for fda action or whether the snda will be approved by the fda 
additionally  even if 
table of contents the snda is approved  such approval could require various actions by the company including modification of the existing acthar label or the adoption of fda mandated risk evaluation and mitigation strategies 
previously  the fda granted orphan designation to the active ingredient in acthar for the treatment of is 
as a result of this orphan designation  if we are successful in obtaining fda approval for the is indication  we will also qualify for tax credits for certain clinical testing expenses and for a seven year exclusivity period during which the fda is prohibited from approving any other acth formulation for is unless the other formulation is demonstrated to be clinically superior to acthar or is considered by the fda to have an active ingredient that is different from the active ingredient of acthar 
we are also currently working on a number of initiatives aimed at developing future growth opportunities for acthar in therapeutic areas other than is 
these include in depth evaluation of uses that are currently a part of the extensive list of on label indications for acthar 
we have observed some continued usage  as well as favorable insurance coverage  in refractory ms patients who do not respond to  or who cannot tolerate  intravenous corticosteroids  the first line treatment of most neurologists for ms flares 
market research indicates that many ms flare patients may be in this subset 
in response  we modestly increased our promotional efforts directed to ms specialists to further explore the potential of this opportunity 
early results from our increased  promotional efforts directed to ms specialists were positive  as net sales of acthar for ms increased  reaching approximately million in the fourth quarter of as a result  in january we announced a plan to double the size of our sales force to sales representatives to ensure greater coverage of the physicians treating refractory ms patients 
in october  we announced that we are evaluating nephrotic syndrome as a potential new growth opportunity for acthar 
nephrotic syndrome is characterized by excessive spilling of protein from the kidneys into the urine  known as proteinuria 
acthar is specifically indicated to induce a diuresis or a remission of proteinuria in the nephrotic syndrome without uremia of the idiopathic type or that due to lupus erythamatosus 
if not adequately treated  patients suffering from nephrotic syndrome often progress to end stage renal disease 
end stage renal disease is a serious  life threatening condition whose current treatments are expensive 
nephrotic syndrome can be caused by a number of different diseases and disorders of the kidney 
in order to increase our knowledge of the role of acthar in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome  we have been in discussions with leading nephrologists and have initiated and funded several planned post approval clinical trials of acthar in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome 
the august implementation of our acthar centric business strategy fundamentally changed the nature of questcor and the success of that strategy to date has resulted in significantly improved financial results for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
our total net sales were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  our income before income taxes and the deemed dividend on the repurchase of our series a preferred stock was million for the year ended december  as compared to income before income taxes and the allocation of earnings to preferred stock of million for the year ended december  as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million as compared to million as of december  during  we returned approximately million to shareholders through our common and preferred stock buyback efforts 
in february  we completed the repurchase of the outstanding  shares of series a preferred stock from shire pharmaceuticals  inc for cash consideration of million  or per share 
in march  we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan providing for our repurchase of up to million of our common shares in either open market or private transactions 
through december   we have repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for million under our stock repurchase plan  at an average price of per share 
in addition  we made two repurchases outside of our share repurchase plan 
on august   we completed a board approved repurchase of  shares of our common stock from chaumiere consultadorio servicos sdc unipessoal lda  an entity owned by paolo cavazza and members of his family  for million or per share 
on september   we completed a board approved repurchase of an additional  shares of our common stock from inverlochy consultadorio servicos lda  an entity owned by claudio cavazza  for million or per share

we do not intend for the information contained on our website to be part of this annual report 
hp acthar gel hp acthar gel  which we acquired in july  is a natural source  highly purified preparation of the adrenal corticotropin hormone acth 
acthar is specially formulated to provide prolonged release after intramuscular or subcutaneous injection 
a primary mechanism of action for acthar is the stimulation of the adrenal cortex to secrete endogenous corticosteroids  including cortisol  corticosterone  aldosterone  and a number of weakly androgenic substances 
it is believed by certain key medical researchers that there may be additional mechanisms of action for acthar 
questcor has initiated the funding of studies of some of these possible mechanisms 
acthar was approved by the fda in and is used in a wide variety of conditions  including the treatment of periodic flares associated with multiple sclerosis  infantile spasms  opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome  and nephrotic syndrome 
acthar is indicated for use in acute exacerbations of ms and is prescribed currently for patients that have ms and experience debilitating  episodic flares 
we promote acthar for the treatment of exacerbations of ms 
intravenous methylprednisolone is the most common treatment of choice for this indication  but acthar continues to be used in some patients who do not respond adequately to intravenous methylprednisolone or who cannot tolerate intravenous methylprednisolone 
although the fda approved package labeling does not include is as an fda approved indication  acthar has historically been used to treat this condition 
based on the document entitled practice parameter medical treatment of infantile spasms  a report of the american academy of neurology and the child neurology society  we believe that there has been no clinical evidence to show that any therapy is better than acthar for the treatment of is 
is is an epileptic syndrome characterized by the triad of infantile spasms generalized seizures  hypsarrhythmia and arrest of psychomotor development at seizure onset 
we estimate that as many as  children annually experience bouts of this devastating syndrome in the us in of children with is  the spasms occur during the first year of life  typically between to months of age 
the first onset rarely occurs after the age of two 
patients left untreated or treated inadequately have a poor prognosis for intellectual and functional development 
about two thirds of patients are neurologically impaired prior to the onset of is  while about one third are otherwise normal 
rapid and aggressive therapy to control the abnormal seizure activity appears to improve the chances that these children will develop to their fullest potential 
the availability of acthar in the several years before our acquisition of the drug in from aventis pharmaceuticals  inc aventis  now csl behring was very restricted  so that many physicians used synthetic steroids and other unapproved products to treat is 
acthar remains the treatment of choice among physicians 
acthar may be challenged by newer agents  such as synthetic corticosteroids  immune system suppressants known as immunosuppressants  and anti seizure medications in the case of is and other types of anti inflammatory products for various autoimmune conditions that have inflammation as a clinical aspect of the disease 
vigabatrin is a potentially competitive product that is currently approved for use in canada and is under review in the united states by the fda for the treatment of infantile spasms 
in january an advisory committee appointed by the fda voted to recommend that the fda approve vigabatrin as a therapy for infantile spasms 
solu medrol methylprednisolone sodium succinate and its generic versions are the primary competitive product to acthar for the treatment of ms flares 
see section below titled competition and item a risk factors risks associated with our current business we are aware of several competitors attempting to develop and market products that treat is  which may reduce or eliminate our commercial opportunity for a discussion of additional risks related to competition 
in addition to being indicated for the treatment of exacerbations of ms and nephrotic syndrome  acthar has over fifty other labeled indications and uses in certain endocrine disorders  rheumatic disorders  collagen diseases  allergic states  ophthalmic diseases  respiratory diseases  hematologic disorders  neoplastic diseases  edematous 
table of contents states  and gastrointestinal diseases 
questcor is currently studying the potential use of acthar in these and other indications and may fund additional studies 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will ever successfully market acthar as a treatment for any of these disorders or diseases 
for the years ended december   and  net sales of acthar were million  million and million  respectively 
doral in may  we purchased the rights in the united states to doral from medpointe pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement 
doral is a commercial product indicated for the treatment of insomnia  characterized by difficulty in falling asleep  frequent nocturnal awakenings  and or early morning awakenings 
sleep disturbance and insomnia are very common side effect of many diseases and disorders 
net sales of doral were  million and  for the years ended december  and and the period may through december  respectively 
product development in november  we initiated a clinical development program under our investigational new drug application with the fda for qsc  a unique orally disintegrating tablet odt formulation of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen hb apap for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain in patients with swallowing difficulties 
qsc is being formulated by eurand pharmaceuticals  inc and would utilize eurand s proprietary microcaps taste masking and advatab tm odt technologies 
we own the world wide rights to commercialize qsc and eurand would exclusively supply the product and receive a royalty on product sales 
hb apap  in its variety of strengths  is one of the most frequently prescribed products in the us and there are currently no odt formulations of hb apap available in the united states 
for the many individuals who experience significant difficulty swallowing pills  we believe qsc represents a valuable option for the treatment of their pain 
during the third quarter of  we completed formulation development of qsc eurand would receive milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development milestones 
we did not make any milestone payments to eurand in currently  we are seeking a partner to complete development of this product so that our research and development resources can be focused on pursuing the numerous potential growth opportunities for acthar that have recently been identified 
questcor continues to incur expenses pursuing obtaining approval for the treatment of is with acthar as well as funding numerous post approval clinical trials for is  ms  and nephrotic syndrome 
our research and development expense totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
manufacturing our products are manufactured for us by approved contract manufacturers 
acthar has a shelf life of months from the date of manufacture 
in  we transferred the acthar final fill and packaging process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  chesapeake biological laboratories  inc cbl  and produced our first lot of acthar finished vials 
this transfer was approved by the fda in january our agreement with cbl extends through in  we transferred the acthar active pharmaceutical ingredient api manufacturing process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  biovectra dcl biovectra  and produced the first biovectra api lot 
the acthar api manufacturing site transfer was approved by the fda in june we have signed an agreement with biovectra  which terminates on december  and includes a one year extension option 
while we have received approval for the acthar finished vials and api transfers to new contract manufacturers  the processes used to manufacture and test acthar are complex and subject to fda inspection and approval 
doral has a shelf life of months from the date of manufacture 
we entered into a separate supply agreement with meda pharmaceuticals formerly medpointe for doral with an initial term of three years 
our agreement with meda calls for meda to procure the raw materials and manufacture and package doral 
the supply agreement may 
table of contents be extended for an additional term of three years upon the written consent of both parties prior to the end of the initial term 
the api used in doral is procured by meda from a third party supplier 
a new manufacturer of the api was approved by the fda in november there can be no assurance that any of our api or finished goods contract manufacturers will continue to meet our requirements for quality  quantity and timeliness 
also  there can be no assurance our contract manufacturers will be able to meet all of the fda s current good manufacturing practice cgmp requirements  nor that lots will not have to be recalled with the attendant financial consequences to us 
our dependence upon others for the manufacture of api or our finished products  or for the manufacture of products that we may acquire or develop  may adversely affect the future profit margin on the sale of those products and our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis 
we do not have substitute suppliers for our products although we strive to plan appropriately and maintain safety stocks of product to cover unforeseen events at manufacturing sites 
in the event we are unable to manufacture our products  either directly or indirectly through others or on commercially acceptable terms  if at all  we may not be able to commercialize our products as planned 
divested product lines in june  we sold to hale biopharma ventures  llc  a development stage company  our rights  including certain patents  relating to the nasal administration of benzodiazepines  which resulted in net proceeds of  in consideration for the purchased assets hale biopharma also agreed to pay questcor potential milestone and royalty payments 
the transferred products require further development and regulatory approval before any sales could occur and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will receive any milestone or royalty payments 
in june  we sold to evoke pharma  inc  a development stage company  our rights relating to nasally administered metaclopromide or other pharmaceutical products covered by the claims set forth in us patent nos 
 and  which resulted in net proceeds of  the purchased assets included various regulatory filings with the fda and the unregistered trademarks emitasol and pramidin 
in consideration for the purchased assets evoke also agreed to pay potential milestone and royalty payments 
the transferred products require further development and regulatory approval before any sales could occur and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will receive any milestone or royalty payments 
sales and marketing we own the worldwide rights for acthar and the us rights for doral 
we do not have substantial operations outside the us however  we have agreements with the following companies to market and distribute acthar on a named patient basis in certain other countries 
beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
we have an agreement with beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
beacon of tunbridge wells  kent  uk  for the exclusive marketing and distribution of acthar in the united kingdom on a named patient basis 
gross sales to beacon were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
idis limited we have an agreement with idis limited idis of sirbiton  surrey  uk for the exclusive distribution of acthar on a named patient basis 
the agreement covers all countries of the world except the united states  australia and new zealand  and the uk  where acthar is sold through beacon 
we did not have any sales to idis for the year ended december  gross sales to idis were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents competition the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that we target 
there are products and treatments on the market that compete with our products 
moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors  which may prevent us from obtaining this technology on favorable terms  or at all 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to acquire and commercialize pharmaceutical products that address critical medical needs  as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and secure sufficient capital resources for the acquisition and commercialization of products 
most of our competitors are larger than us and have substantially greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we have 
furthermore  if we commence commercial sales of products that we may develop  should they be approved  we will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities  areas in which we have limited experience 
if any of the competitors develop new products that are superior to our products  our ability to expand into the pharmaceutical markets may be materially and adversely affected 
competition among products will be based  among other things  on product efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  price and patent position 
an important factor will be the timing of market introduction of our or our competitors products 
accordingly  the relative speed with which we can acquire products and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is expected to be an important competitive factor 
certain potentially competitive products to acthar are in various stages of development  some of which have been filed for approval with the fda or have been approved by regulatory authorities in other countries 
vigabatrin is a potentially competitive product that is currently approved for use in canada and is under review in the united states by the fda for the treatment of infantile spasms 
in january an advisory committee appointed by the fda voted to recommend that the fda approve vigabatrin as a therapy for infantile spasms 
an additional potentially competitive drug to acthar that we are currently monitoring is ganaxolone 
the current success of our acthar centric business strategy is likely to attract additional competition 
see item a risk factors risks associated with our current business we are aware of several competitors attempting to develop and market products that treat is  which may reduce or eliminate our commercial opportunity for a discussion of additional risks related to competition 
government regulation marketed pharmaceutical products all pharmaceutical operations associated with the production  testing  packaging and distribution of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by the fda 
any restrictions or prohibitions applicable to sales of products we market could materially and adversely affect our business 
we market prescription drug products that have been approved by the fda 
the fda has the authority to revoke existing approvals if new information reveals that they are not safe or effective 
the fda also regulates the promotion  including advertisement  of prescription drugs 
in september  the us president signed the food and drug administration amendments act of  or fdaaa 
the new legislation grants significant new powers to the fda  many of which are aimed at addressing the safety of drug products before and after approval 
in particular  the new law authorizes the fda to  among other things  require post approval studies and clinical trials  mandate changes to drug labeling to reflect new safety information  and require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies for certain drugs  including certain currently approved drugs 
in addition  it significantly expands the federal government s clinical trial registry and results databank and creates new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of drug products 
under the fdaaa  companies that violate these and other provisions of the new law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties 
although we expect these and other provisions of the fdaaa to have a substantial effect on the pharmaceutical industry  the extent of that effect is not yet known 
as the fda issues regulations  guidance and 
table of contents interpretations relating to the new legislation  the impact on the industry  as well as our business  will become clearer 
the new requirements and other changes that the fdaaa imposes may make it more difficult  and likely more costly  to obtain approval of new pharmaceutical products and to produce  market and distribute existing products  and may impact our pending snda application 
drug products must be manufactured  tested  packaged  and labeled in accordance with their approvals and in conformity with cgmp standards and other requirements 
drug manufacturing facilities must be registered with and approved by the fda and must list with the fda the drug products they intend to manufacture or distribute 
the manufacturer is subject to inspections by the fda and periodic inspections by other regulatory agencies 
the fda has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers  including authority to seize and prohibit the sale of unapproved or non complying products  and to halt any pharmaceutical operations that are not in compliance with cgmps 
the courts may impose criminal penalties arising from non compliance with applicable fda regulations 
in march we received a drug class action letter from the fda requesting modifications to labeling and creation of a medication guide for sedative hypnotic drug products that are indicated for the treatment of insomnia  including our product doral 
we have revised doral s labeling and created a medication guide  both of which have been approved by the fda 
in february we began shipping doral product with the revised labeling and new medication guide 
questcor operates in a highly regulated industry 
we are subject to the regulatory authority of the securities and exchange commission  the food and drug administration and numerous other federal and state governmental agencies including state attorney general offices  which have become more active in investigating the business practices of pharmaceutical companies 
from time to time  we receive informal requests for information from various governmental agencies 
on february   we received a civil investigative demand cid from the attorney general of the state of missouri  in connection with its investigation of our pricing practices with respect to acthar under missouri s merchandising practices act 
we are in the process of responding to the cid and intend to cooperate with missouri s attorney general office  as we have with respect to government inquiries of all types 
there can be no assurance that these types of informal requests for information or investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
see item a risk factors other risks associated with our business we are currently subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes for a discussion of risks related to government regulation of marketed pharmaceutical products 
drugs in development products in development are subject to extensive regulation by the us  principally under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and the public health service act  and if applicable by foreign governmental authorities 
in particular  drugs and biological products are subject to rigorous pre clinical and clinical testing and other approval requirements by the fda  state and local authorities and comparable foreign regulatory authorities 
the process for obtaining the required regulatory approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities takes many years and is very expensive 
there can be no assurance that any product developed by us and current or potential development partners will prove to meet all of the applicable standards to receive marketing approval in the us or abroad 
there can be no assurance that these approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
delays and costs in obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal  state and local statutes and regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and our ability to earn sales revenues 
product liability insurance the clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products may expose us to product liability claims  against which we maintain liability insurance 
see item a risk factors other risks associated with our business if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or we become subject to other forms of litigation  we may incur substantial liabilities and costs and may be required to limit commercialization of our products for a discussion of certain risks related to product liability claims that may be made against us 

table of contents patents and proprietary rights our success may depend in part upon our ability to maintain confidentiality  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties  and obtain patent protection for our products 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
we do not have a patent on acthar or doral 
however  we do have us and foreign patents covering our other technology 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products or services 
unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products  services or proprietary information 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights as well as the laws of the united states 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be time consuming and costly 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as we expand our product and service offerings and the number of competitors increases 
defending against these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert our attention from operating our company 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing upon their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and be forced to develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease using the applications that contain the infringing technology or content 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or content or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
see item a risk factors other risks associated with our business if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  we may lose our competitive position and future revenues for a discussion of additional risks related to intellectual property rights 
employees as of december  and we had and full time employees  respectively 
as of december   we had sales force representatives 
in january we announced that we are increasing our sales force to representatives in order to build upon continued positive growth trends in prescriptions of acthar for the treatment of exacerbations associated with ms  an indication for which acthar is already approved 
we anticipate completing this phase of our sales force expansion by the end of the first quarter of depending upon the success of the first phase of our sales force expansion  a second phase of our sales force expansion to approximately representatives could occur later in our continued success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain key employees 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  nor have we experienced work stoppages

financial information please refer to item  selected consolidated financial data  for a review of our financial results and financial position for the five years ended december   and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a review of revenue and net income loss for the three years ended december  
table of contents item a 
risk factors risks associated with our current business substantially all of our revenue and profits are derived from acthar 
for the year ended december   sales of acthar represented of our total net sales 
we expect to continue to rely on this product for substantially all of our revenues and profits for the foreseeable future 
also  for the year ended december   a significant percentage of acthar prescriptions were for is  which is not an approved indication for acthar 
we cannot predict whether we will continue to generate significant revenues from sales of acthar 
if the demand for acthar declines  if competitive products are approved by the fda  if the fda requires us to make changes to the label of acthar which harm our ability to market acthar  if third party payors refuse to provide reimbursement for purchases of acthar  if we are forced to reduce the price for acthar  if a greater proportion of our acthar unit sales is comprised of product dispensed to medicaid eligible patients and government entities where we do not expect to recognize any net sales  or if we are forced to re negotiate important contracts or terms  our net sales from the sale of acthar would decline 
if the cost to produce acthar increases  our gross margins on the sale of acthar would decline 
if our net sales or gross margins from the sale of acthar decline  our ability to generate profits would be harmed 
we utilize curascript  a third party specialty distributor  to distribute acthar 
we rely on curascript for all of our proceeds from sales of acthar in the united states 
the outsourcing of these functions is complex  and we may experience difficulties that could reduce  delay or stop shipments of acthar 
if we encounter such distribution problems  acthar distribution could become disrupted  resulting in lost revenues or customer dissatisfaction 
we rely on contract manufacturers to produce acthar 
contract manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs with respect to timing  cost  quantity or quality 
all of our manufacturers are sole source manufacturers and no currently qualified alternative suppliers exist 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of acthar on acceptable terms  or if we encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our manufacturers  we will lose the ability to fulfill orders and thus will lose sales 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practices enforced by the fda 
if the facilities of these manufacturers cannot pass an inspection  supply would be disrupted 
failure to obtain products for sale for any reason may result in an inability to meet acthar demand and a loss of potential revenues 
we cannot predict whether the fda will approve our snda for acthar 
we are continuing to pursue a supplemental new drug application snda to the fda to add the treatment of infantile spasms is to the list of approved indications on the acthar label 
however  there can be no assurance as to the actual timetable for fda action or whether the snda will be approved by the fda 
additionally  even if the snda is approved  such approval could require various actions by the company including modification of the existing acthar label or the adoption of fda mandated risk evaluation and mitigation strategies 
a significant percentage of acthar prescriptions is for is  which is not an approved indication for acthar 
while physicians may lawfully prescribe acthar for is and other off label uses  any promotion by us for off label uses would be unlawful 
the risk associated with our inability to promote acthar could be increased by the fda approval of a competitive product  as we would be unable to actively counter any claims made by the sales force for such competitive product 
we are aware of several competitors attempting to develop and market products that treat is  which may reduce or eliminate our commercial opportunity 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological changes  and a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that we target 
we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of potentially competitive products or their possible effect on our sales 
certain potentially competitive products to acthar are in various stages of 
table of contents development  some of which have been filed for approval with the fda or have been approved by regulatory authorities in other countries 
vigabatrin is a potentially competitive product that is currently approved for use in numerous countries other than the us and is currently under review in the united states by the fda for the treatment of infantile spasms 
in january an advisory committee appointed by the fda voted to recommend that the fda approve vigabatrin as a therapy for infantile spasms 
if vigabatrin is approved by the fda and is commercially launched for is in the united states prior to our snda being approved  then our sales of acthar would likely decline 
even if our snda is approved by the fda on or prior to the date of the commercial launch of vigabatrin  our sales of acthar could decline 
prednisone and prednisolone are the generic names for anti inflammatory corticosteroid drugs that are used to treat various types of inflammation 
one off label use of these drugs has been to treat infantile spasms 
should more doctors prescribe prednisone or prednisolone to target the same diseases and conditions that acthar targets  the result could be detrimental to current acthar sales 
an additional potentially competitive drug to acthar that we are currently monitoring is ganaxolone 
ganaxolone is currently undergoing a phase iib study for the treatment of infantile spasms  but is not currently approved in any jurisdiction 
ganaxolone could potentially compete with acthar in the future should it receive the necessary fda and regulatory approvals 
some of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in development  manufacturing  obtaining regulatory approvals  and marketing than we do 
other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
in addition to the possibility of competitive products not based on acth  a competitor could seek approval for  and the fda could approve  a generic version of acthar 
acthar does not have any patent or other form of exclusivity protection that would legally prevent the fda from approving a generic version 
if a competitor applied to the fda for a generic version  we would not receive any notice from the fda about the existence of the application 
we may be negatively affected by lower reimbursement levels 
our ability to generate net sales is affected by the availability of third party reimbursement for acthar  and our ability to generate net sales will be diminished if we fail to maintain an adequate level of reimbursement for acthar from such third party payors 
the sale of acthar depends in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as private insurance plans 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  a number of state and federal proposals that limit the amount that private insurance plans may pay to reimburse the cost of drugs  including acthar 
we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of acthar  which may also impact sales of acthar 
in addition  current third party reimbursement policies for acthar may change at any time 
negative changes in reimbursement or our failure to obtain reimbursement for acthar may reduce the demand for  or the price of  acthar  which could result in lower acthar sales  thereby weakening our competitive position and negatively impacting our results of operations 
medicaid eligible patients and government entities may account for a greater proportion of our acthar unit sales resulting in reduced net sales 
a portion of the estimated end user vial demand for acthar is for patients covered under medicaid and other government related programs 
as required by federal regulations  we provide rebates related to acthar dispensed to a significant percentage of medicaid patients 
in addition  certain other government supported agencies are permitted to purchase acthar for a nominal amount from our specialty distributor  which then charges the discount back to us 
as a result of these rebates and chargebacks  we do not generate any net sales with respect to sales which are subject to rebates or chargebacks 
as a result of current economic conditions  recently adopted legislation or potential future legislation  it is possible that a greater proportion of acthar sales will be subject to these rebates and 
table of contents chargebacks  reducing our net sales 
additionally  there could be changes to medicaid regulations resulting in higher rebates and chargebacks  which would reduce our net sales further 
on february   the us president released an outline of the administration s budget proposals for fiscal year  which begins october  further detail is expected to be issued in april 
the budget outline proposes that congress should increase the amount of rebates collected from manufacturers for drugs dispensed to medicaid patients by imposing rebates on drugs dispensed to medicaid patients enrolled in managed care organizations  which are not subject to rebates under current law  and by increasing the amount of the minimum basic rebate 
if these proposals are enacted  they would significantly increase the proportion of sales of acthar for which we would generate no net sales revenue 
federal and or state health care reform initiatives could negatively affect our business 
bills and regulations proposing comprehensive health care reform are being formulated in congress and state legislatures as well as in agencies of those governmental bodies that could potentially limit pharmaceutical prices and establish mandatory or voluntary refunds 
it is uncertain if any legislative proposals will be adopted and how federal  state or private payors for health care goods and services will respond to any health care reforms 
various governmental entities may focus on pharmaceutical prices by holding hearings or launching investigations regarding the pricing for drugs by specialty pharmaceutical companies such as ours and the ability of patients to obtain drugs 
in july  the joint economic committee of congress held hearings on the pricing of drugs for rare conditions 
should hearings or investigations occur that result in legislative changes or consent decrees regarding drug pricing  we may be forced to decrease our price that we charge for acthar  thereby decreasing our net income 
questcor operates in a highly regulated industry 
we are subject to the regulatory authority of the securities and exchange commission  the food and drug administration and numerous other federal and state governmental agencies including state attorney general offices  which have become more active in investigating the business practices of pharmaceutical companies 
from time to time  we receive informal requests for information from various governmental agencies 
on february   we received a civil investigative demand cid from the attorney general of the state of missouri  in connection with its investigation of our pricing practices with respect to acthar under missouri s merchandising practices act 
we are in the process of responding to the cid and intend to cooperate with missouri s attorney general office  as we have with respect to government inquiries of all types 
there can be no assurance that these types of informal requests for information or investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
the current economic environment may impact our business 
the current economic environment presents us with several potential challenges 
as a result of the current credit and financial market conditions  third party payors such as private insurance companies may be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or may delay payment 
state and federal reimbursement programs such as medicaid may curtail their reimbursements due to budget cuts 
in addition  the economic environment could result in more patients seeking coverage for acthar through medicaid  where we do not generate net sales for acthar referrals dispensed to a significant percentage of medicaid covered patients 
due to the recent tightening of global credit and the disruption in the financial markets  there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third party contractors  suppliers or collaborators  including curascript 
if curascript is unable to satisfy its commitments to us  our business would be adversely affected 
there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third party manufacturers for acthar 
if such third party manufacturers are unable to satisfy their commitments to us  our business would be adversely affected 
the current global economic crisis may have a negative impact on the market values of the investments in our investment portfolio 
we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and there can be no assurance that the markets for these securities will not deteriorate further or that the institutions that hold these investments will be able to meet their debt obligations at the time we may need to liquidate such investments or until such time as the investments mature 

table of contents we have a history of operating losses and have only recently generated sufficient revenue to achieve profitability 
since acquiring acthar in july  questcor experienced several changes in strategy and management but was unable to achieve consistent profitability prior to the adoption of our acthar centric business model 
as a result  from the time of our acquisition of acthar through august  we experienced operating losses of approximately million 
at the time of the adoption of our acthar centric business model  we had very limited financial resources and believed we had no access to the capital markets 
while we generated operating profit in and  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be profitable in future periods 
even with the early successful results of our new strategy  we still had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  if we are unable to continue to generate profits  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private sales of our equity securities  or through debt financings 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our existing shareholders ownership will be diluted 
any debt  receivables or royalty financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations 
these restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens  pay dividends  redeem our stock or make investments 
risks associated with our growth initiatives our strategy to generate acthar revenue from other therapeutic areas might not be successful 
while acthar is already approved by the fda for the treatment of ms  we may not be successful in promoting acthar as a second line treatment for ms 
in january  we announced an expansion of our sales force  with a plan to double the size of our sales force to sales representatives 
our increasing our sales force will increase our operating expenses and there can be no assurance that we will successfully manage our sales force expansion or generate sufficient additional net sales in ms to generate an acceptable return on our investment in increasing the size of the sales force 
in addition  we may not be successful in promoting acthar as a treatment for nephrotic syndrome  another on label indication 
there is very limited data on the efficacy of acthar in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome 
it is unclear what amount of clinical or other data physicians will require prior to deciding to use acthar in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome 
also  while there are over approved indications on the acthar label  for many of these indications it is not likely that we will be successful in generating net sales in the near future 
further  under the food and drug administration amendments act of  the fda has greater authority to require sponsors to modify labels of previously approved drugs 
we have a very limited pipeline of new products 
since the adoption of our acthar centric business model in august  we have focused our research and development efforts on acthar 
besides acthar  our pipeline of potential new products consists of a single development program qsc in february  we announced that we were seeking a partner to complete development of qsc there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify such a partner or successfully negotiate a license or other agreement with commercially reasonable terms 
such terms could include deferred consideration in the form of milestone payments and royalties and there can be no assurance that any such payments or royalties would actually become due to questcor 
we are also exploring conducting development efforts  or financing the development efforts of third parties  of additional pharmaceutical products addressing serious  rare conditions with unmet medical needs 
other risks associated with our business the loss of our key management personnel could have an adverse impact on future operations 
we are highly dependent on the services of the principal members of our senior management team  and the loss of a member of senior management could create significant disruption in our ability to provide acthar to our customers 
we do not carry key person life insurance for our senior management or other personnel 
additionally  the future potential growth and expansion of our business is expected to place increased demands on our management skills and resources 
recruiting and retaining management and operational personnel to perform sales and marketing  financial operations  business development  clinical development  regulatory affairs  quality 
table of contents assurance  medical affairs and contract manufacturing in the future will also be critical to our success 
we do not know if we will be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced management and operational personnel in the future on acceptable terms given the intense competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for such personnel 
if we are unable to hire necessary skilled personnel in the future  our business could be harmed 
we are currently subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 
without considering the impact of any proposed or future health care reform initiatives  no assurance can be given that we will remain in compliance with currently applicable fda and other regulatory requirements for our currently marketed products or any new product once clearance or approval has been obtained 
these requirements include  among other things  regulations regarding manufacturing practices  product labeling and post marketing reporting  including adverse event reports and field alerts due to product quality concerns 
additionally  the facilities and procedures of our suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation  including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
a significant percentage of acthar prescriptions is for the treatment of is  which is not an approved indication for acthar 
while physicians may lawfully prescribe acthar for is and other off label uses  any promotion by us of any off label uses would be unlawful 
some of our practices that are intended to respond to questions from physicians with respect to off label uses of acthar without engaging in off label promotion could nonetheless be construed by the fda as off label promotion 
although we have policies and procedures in place designed to help assure ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements regarding off label promotion  some non compliant actions may nonetheless occur or be deemed by regulatory authorities to have occurred 
regulatory authorities could take enforcement action against us if they believe we are promoting or have promoted our products for off label use 
also  the label for acthar includes a list of indications for which acthar has not been actively promoted or prescribed for in several years  if ever 
it is possible that the fda could  in the context of reviewing our snda for is or otherwise  conduct a review of the acthar label and require us to provide data to the fda regarding the safety and efficacy of acthar relating to these indications 
the regulatory process  which may include extensive pre clinical studies and clinical trials of each product to establish its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years  and requires the expenditure of substantial resources  time and effort to ensure compliance with complex regulations 
should we fail to comply with applicable regulations  possible regulatory actions could include warning letters  fines  damages  injunctions  civil penalties  recalls  seizures of our products and criminal prosecution 
these actions could result in  among other things  substantial modifications to our business practices and operations  refunds  recalls or a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of our suppliers facilities while our suppliers remedy the alleged violation  the inability to obtain future pre market clearances or approvals  and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market 
any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
in addition  data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance for a product 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances could stall the marketing  selling and distribution of any products that we develop  impose significant additional costs on us  diminish any competitive advantages that we may attain  and decrease our ability to generate revenues and profits 

table of contents regulatory approval  if granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a new product may be marketed that could limit the potential market for the product 
product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
furthermore  manufacturers of approved products are subject to pervasive review  including compliance with detailed regulations governing fda good manufacturing practices 
the fda periodically revises the good manufacturing practices regulations and requires manufacturers to remain current with the latest regulations 
in addition  we cannot predict the extent of government regulations or the impact of new governmental regulations that may result in a delay in the development  production and marketing of our products 
as such  we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  we may lose our competitive position and future revenues 
we do not have patents on our existing commercial products 
however  our success will depend in part on our ability to do the following obtain patents for our products and technologies  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we will only be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets and are otherwise protectable under applicable law 
we will attempt to protect our proprietary position by filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary products  technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
the patent positions of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
thus  any patents that we own or license from third parties for future products may not provide any protection against competitors 
pending patent applications we may file in the future  or those we may license from third parties  may not result in patents being issued 
also  patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed or we will develop 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in addition to patents for future products  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how for acthar 
we currently seek protection  in part  through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for proprietary technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information 
the parties may not comply with or may breach these agreements 
furthermore  our trade secrets may otherwise become known to  or be independently developed by competitors 
our success will further depend  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
if our activities infringe on patents owned by others  we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against a licensor or us 
should our products or technologies be found to infringe on patents issued to third parties  the manufacture  use and sale of our products could be enjoined  and we could be required to pay substantial damages 
in addition  we  in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies  may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  which may not be made available on terms acceptable to us 

table of contents we may not be able to fully utilize the benefit of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  and federal and california research and development tax credits of  and  respectively 
federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling million are subject to annual limitations and will be available from through  as a result of federal ownership change limitations 
of this amount  million of federal net operating loss carryforwards are available to reduce our taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and the federal research and development credit carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in the years through  if not utilized 
utilization of our net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may still be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions for ownership changes after december  such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards available as of december  before utilization 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results 
as a result  current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could have a negative market reaction 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to report on  and requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
at december   we were compliant and have implemented an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to continue to comply with these requirements 
accordingly  we continue to incur expenses and will devote management resources to section compliance as necessary 
further  effective internal controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
if our internal controls and procedures become ineffective  we may not be able to provide reliable financial reports  our business and operating results could be harmed and current and potential shareholders may not have confidence in our financial reporting 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or we become subject to other forms of litigation  we may incur substantial liabilities and costs and may be required to limit commercialization of our products 
our business exposes us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the manufacturing  testing and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
the use of our currently marketed products or any drug candidates ultimately developed by us or our collaborators in clinical trials may expose us to product liability claims and possible adverse publicity 
under a recent united states supreme court ruling  fda approval of a drug does not prevent the filing of product liability claims in state courts  potentially making it more costly and time consuming to defend against such claims 
product liability insurance for the pharmaceutical industry is generally expensive  if available at all 
we currently have product liability insurance for claims up to million 
however  if we are unable to maintain insurance coverage at acceptable costs  in a sufficient amount  or at all  or if we become subject to a product liability claim  our reputation  stock price and ability to devote the necessary resources to the commercialization of our products could be negatively impacted 
business interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business 
our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses  human error  natural disasters  telecommunications failures  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
in particular  our corporate headquarters is located in the san francisco bay area  which has a history of seismic activity 
we have not established a formal disaster recovery plan  and our back up operations and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that occur 
a significant business interruption could result in losses or damages incurred by us and require us to cease or curtail our operations

the price of our common stock is subject to significant volatility 
the closing price per share of our common stock ranged in value from to during the two year period ended december  any number of events  both internal and external to us  may continue to affect our stock price 
for example  our quarterly revenues or earnings or losses can fluctuate based on the buying patterns of our specialty distributor and our end users 
in the event that patient demand for acthar is less than our sales to our specialty distributor  excess acthar inventories may result at our specialty distributor and end users  which may impact future acthar sales

any statements as to our expectations or beliefs concerning  or projections or forecasts of  our future financial performance or future financial condition  or with respect to trends in our business or in our markets  are forward looking statements 
factors that could affect our future operating results and cause them to differ  possibly significantly  from those currently anticipated are described in i item a  entitled risk factors  in part i of this annual report  and ii the subsection entitled critical accounting policies and use of estimates in item below and  accordingly  the descriptions of the risk factors and the critical accounting policies and use of estimates in this annual report should be read in their entirety 
overview we market hp acthar gel repository corticotropin injection  an injectable drug that is approved for the treatment of certain disorders with an inflammatory component  including the treatment of exacerbations associated with multiple sclerosis ms  and the treatment of nephrotic syndrome 
hp acthar gel acthar is not indicated for  but is also used in treating patients with infantile spasms is  a rare form of refractory childhood epilepsy  and opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome  a rare autoimmune related childhood neurological disorder 
we also market doral quazepam  which is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep  frequent nocturnal awakenings  and or early morning awakenings 
in august  we announced our acthar centric business strategy  which included a new pricing level for acthar effective august  the strategy was adopted in order to best position acthar to benefit patients  advance our product development programs and ensure that the company become economically viable 
since the adoption of the strategy  we have expanded our sponsorship of acthar patient assistance and co pay assistance programs  which provide an important safety net for uninsured and under insured patients using acthar  and have established a group of product service consultants and medical science liaisons to work with healthcare providers who administer acthar 
we have provided free acthar with a commercial value of over million to uninsured and under insured patients 
in addition to the free drug program  we have provided significant financial support to patients through the co pay assistance program of the national organization for rare disorders nord 
as a result of these efforts  we are not aware of a single patient who needed acthar but was not able to access it 
this was not the case before our strategy change 
because we are now economically viable  we have significantly improved our ability to maintain the long term availability of acthar and fund important medical research projects that have the goal of improving patient care  despite the deterioration of the current us economic environment 
we have been working closely with the neurology community to identify promising new projects for which we can provide needed financial support 
we are providing support to leading researchers in their efforts to better understand the underlying disease processes that cause infantile spasms  a subject for which there has been little research funding in recent decades 
we are also in discussions with experts in other disease states with high unmet medical needs for which there is a potential therapeutic role for acthar 
as a result of these initiatives  which have been made possible by our change in strategy  we expect to fund more than a dozen new pre clinical and clinical studies in we are also exploring conducting development efforts  or financing the development efforts of third parties  of additional pharmaceutical products addressing serious  rare conditions with unmet medical needs 

table of contents acthar is currently approved in the us for the treatment of exacerbations associated with ms  nephrotic syndrome and many other conditions with an inflammatory component 
pursuant to guidelines published by the american academy of neurology and the child neurology society  many child neurologists use acthar to treat infants afflicted with is even though it is not approved for this indication 
we are continuing to pursue a supplemental new drug application snda to the us food and drug administration fda to add the treatment of is to the list of approved indications on the acthar label 
if the submission is accepted for filing by the fda  we anticipate that the fda may take final action on the snda in late  though there can be no assurance as to the actual timetable for fda action or whether the snda will be approved by the fda 
additionally  even if the snda is approved  such approval could require various actions by the company including modification of the existing acthar label or the adoption of fda mandated risk evaluation and mitigation strategies 
previously  the fda granted orphan designation to the active ingredient in acthar for the treatment of is 
as a result of this orphan designation  if we are successful in obtaining fda approval for the is indication  we will also qualify for tax credits for certain clinical testing expenses and for a seven year exclusivity period during which the fda is prohibited from approving any other acth formulation for is unless the other formulation is demonstrated to be clinically superior to acthar or is considered by the fda to have an active ingredient that is different from the active ingredient of acthar 
the august implementation of our acthar centric business strategy fundamentally changed the nature of questcor and the success of that strategy to date has resulted in significantly improved financial results for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
our total net sales were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  our income before income taxes and the deemed dividend on the repurchase of our series a preferred stock was million for the year ended december  as compared to income before income taxes and the allocation of earnings to preferred stock of million for the year ended december  as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million as compared to million as of december  during  we returned approximately million to shareholders through our common and preferred stock buyback efforts 
in february  we completed the repurchase of the outstanding  shares of series a preferred stock from shire pharmaceuticals  inc for cash consideration of million or per share 
in march  we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan providing for our repurchase of up to million of our common shares in either open market or private transactions 
through december   we have repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for million under our stock repurchase plan  at an average price of per share 
in addition  we made two repurchases outside of our share repurchase plan 
on august   we completed a board approved repurchase of  shares of our common stock from chaumiere consultadorio servicos sdc unipessoal lda  an entity owned by paolo cavazza and members of his family  for million or per share 
on september   we completed a board approved repurchase of an additional  shares of our common stock from inverlochy consultadorio servicos lda  an entity owned by claudio cavazza  for million or per share 
our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors  demand for our products by patients  inventory levels of our products held by third parties  the amount of medicaid rebates on our products dispensed to medicaid eligible patients  the amount of chargebacks on the sale of our products by our specialty distributor to government supported entities  the availability of finished goods from our sole source manufacturers  the timing of certain expenses  the timing and amount of our product development expenses  the introduction of a competitive product  and our ability to develop growth opportunities for acthar 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  our medicaid rebate obligation related to our products dispensed to medicaid eligible patients  chargebacks on sales of our products by wholesalers and our specialty distributor to government entities  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  share 
table of contents based compensation  lease termination liability and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
sales reserves we have estimated reserves for product returns from our specialty distributor  wholesalers  hospitals and pharmacies  medicaid rebates to all states for products dispensed to patients covered by medicaid  government chargebacks for sales of our products by wholesalers and our specialty distributor to certain federal government organizations including the veterans administration  and cash discounts for prompt payment on our sales of doral 
we estimate our reserves by utilizing historical information for our existing products and data obtained from external sources 
significant judgment is inherent in the selection of assumptions and the interpretation of historical experience as well as the identification of external and internal factors affecting the estimates of our reserves for product returns  medicaid rebates  and chargebacks 
we believe that the assumptions used to estimate these sales reserves are reasonable considering known facts and circumstances 
however  our product returns  medicaid rebates  and chargebacks could differ significantly from our estimates because our analysis of product shipments  prescription trends  the amount of product in the distribution channel  and our interpretation of the medicaid statute and regulations  may not be accurate 
if actual product returns  medicaid rebates  and chargebacks are significantly different from our estimates  such differences would be accounted for in the period in which they become known 
to date  actual amounts have been generally consistent with our estimates 
product returns during july  we began utilizing curascript  a third party specialty distributor  to store and distribute acthar 
effective august   we no longer sell acthar to wholesalers and all of our proceeds from sales of acthar in the united states are received from curascript 
we sell acthar to curascript at a discount from our list price 
gross product sales are recognized net of this discount upon receipt of the product by curascript 
in april  we announced the amendment to our distribution agreement with curascript  which became effective on june  under the new terms  the discount provided by us to curascript is reduced from  per vial to per vial 
the new discounted sales price to curascript is  per vial and the stated list price remains at  however  under the new terms the pricing to curascript customers is unchanged 
the amount of the discount to curascript is subject to annual adjustments based on the consumer price index 
in addition  the payment terms have been reduced from days to days from when product is received by curascript 
under our distribution agreement with curascript  if the price of acthar is reduced  curascript will receive a shelf stock adjustment credit based upon the amount of product in their inventory at the time of the price reduction 
any reduction in the selling price of acthar is at our discretion 
to date  there have been no such price reductions 
we will supply replacement product to curascript on product returned between one month prior to expiration to three months post expiration 
returns from product lots will be exchanged for replacement product  and estimated costs for such exchanges  which include actual product material costs and related shipping charges  are included in cost of sales 
a reserve for estimated future replacements has been recorded as a liability within sales related reserves which will be reduced as future replacements occur  with an offset to product inventories 
we issue credit memoranda or reimburse wholesalers or their customers for product sold to wholesalers that is returned within six months beyond the expiration date 
the credit memoranda or reimbursement is equal to the sales value of the product returned and the estimated amount of such obligation is recorded as a liability within sales related reserves with a corresponding reduction in gross product sales 
this liability is reduced as the obligation is satisfied  with an offset to accounts receivable 
the reserve for the sales value of expired product expected to be returned by wholesalers and their customers relates to estimated returns associated with our sales of doral and our estimate of returns associated with sales of acthar to wholesalers prior to our transition to curascript in july in estimating the return rate for expired product returned by wholesalers and their customers  we primarily analyze 
table of contents historical returns by product and return merchandise authorizations 
we also consider current inventory on hand at wholesalers  the remaining shelf life of that inventory  and changes in demand measured by prescriptions or other data as provided by an independent third party source 
we believe that the information obtained from wholesalers regarding inventory levels and from independent third parties regarding prescription demand is reliable  but we are unable to independently verify the accuracy of such data 
we routinely assess our historical experience including customers compliance with our product return policy  and we change our reserve estimates as appropriate 
a change in the rate of product returns would not have a material effect on our sales or operating income 
the following table summarizes the activity in the account associated with sales related reserves for product returns under our credit memo policy in s balance at january actual returns in current year related to sales from prior years actual returns in current year related to sales from current year current provision related to sales made in prior years current provision related to sales made in current year balance at december the decrease in the provision as of december  relates to the transition of acthar distribution from multiple wholesalers to our sole specialty distributor 
we provide credit to wholesalers and their customers and provide replacement product to our specialty distributor 
as of december    of the returns reserve related to the final product lots of acthar shipped to wholesalers under our credit memorandum policy with product expiration dates in medicaid rebates we provide a rebate related to product dispensed to medicaid eligible patients 
our a estimated historical rebate percentage  adjusted for b recent and expected future utilization rates for these programs  is used to estimate the rebate units associated with product shipped during a period as follows a the estimated historic liability included in sales related reserves as of the end of a period is comprised of the estimated rebate units associated with estimated end user demand during the period  the estimated rebate units associated with estimated inventory in the distribution channel as of the end of the period  and the estimated rebate units  if any  associated with prior rebate periods 
b in order to assess current and future rates of medicaid utilization  we analyze inventory levels and patient prescription data received from a third party  curascript 
the rebate amount per unit is determined based on a formula established by statute and is subject to review and modification by the administrators of the medicaid program 
the rebate per unit formula is comprised of a basic rebate of applied to the average per unit amount of payments we receive on our product sales and an additional per unit rebate that is based on our current sales price compared to our sales price on an inflation adjusted basis from a designated base period 
we multiply the rebate amount per unit by the estimated rebate units to arrive at the estimated reserve for the period 
this estimated reserve is deducted from gross sales in the determination of net sales 
effective january   the amount we rebate for each acthar vial dispensed to a medicaid eligible patient is approximately  higher than our price to curascript 
our acthar rebate amount per unit was approximately of our price to our specialty distributor through august  and increased to of our price to our specialty distributor during the fourth quarter ended december  management believes that the information received from curascript related to prescription data and inventory levels is reliable  but we are unable to independently verify the accuracy of such data 
the medicaid rebates associated with end user demand for a period are paid to the states by the end of the quarter following the quarter in which the rebate estimated reserve is established 
we routinely assess our experience with medicaid rebates and adjust the reserves accordingly 
revisions in the medicaid rebate estimates are charged to income in the period in which the information that 
table of contents gives rise to the revision becomes known 
we consider a to percentage point variance to be a reasonably likely change in the percent of medicaid rebates to related gross sales 
a to percentage point change in the estimated rebate rate on our rebate accrual would lead to an approximate million to million effect on net sales and an approximate million to million effect on operating income in in connection with the implementation of our new pricing strategy for acthar  coupled with recent clarifications of the statute in july by program administrators  during we initiated an extensive review of the medicaid statute and regulations 
after such review and consultation with our regulatory legal counsel  we prospectively modified how we determine our rebate amount per unit to conform with the statute 
the modification was implemented in august and communicated to the program administrators in september the modification increased net sales and net income applicable to common shareholders by million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  this sales and income benefit ended during the fourth quarter of the following table summarizes the activity in the account for sales related reserves for medicaid rebates in s balance at january actual medicaid payments for sales made in prior year actual medicaid payments for sales made in current year current medicaid provision for sales made in prior year current medicaid provision for sales made in current year balance at december the increase in the current medicaid provision for sales made in the current year in and relates to the increased pricing level for acthar effective august   which resulted in higher rebate amounts 
government chargebacks certain government supported entities are permitted to purchase our products for a nominal amount from wholesalers and curascript 
the wholesalers and curascript charge the significant discount back to us and reduce subsequent payment to us by the amount of the approved chargeback 
the chargeback approximates our sales price to our customers 
as a result  we recognize nominal  if any  net sales on shipments to these entities that qualify for the government chargeback 
the reduction to gross sales for a period related to chargebacks is comprised of actual approved chargebacks originating during the period and an estimate of chargebacks in the ending inventory of our customers 
in estimating the government chargeback reserve as of the end of a period  we estimate the amount of chargebacks in our customers ending inventory using actual average monthly chargeback amounts and ending inventory balances provided by our largest customers 
chargebacks are generally applied by customers against their payments to us approximately to days after they have provided appropriate documentation to confirm their sale to a qualified government supported entity 
we routinely assess the chargeback estimates and adjust the reserves accordingly 
revisions in chargeback estimates are charged to income in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known 
a change in the chargeback estimates would not have a material effect on our sales or operating income 

table of contents the following table summarizes the activity in the account for sales related reserves for government chargebacks in s balance at january actual chargeback payments for sales made in prior year actual chargeback payments for sales made in current year current chargeback provision for sales made in prior year current chargeback provision for sales made in current year balance at december the increase in the current chargeback provision for sales made in the current year in and relates to the increased pricing level for acthar effective august   which resulted in higher chargeback amounts 
other we have estimated that approximately of our estimated acthar end user unit demand is used by patients covered by medicaid and other government related programs 
acthar gross sales were reduced by to account for the estimated amount of medicaid rebates and government chargebacks for the year ended december  a greater percentage of infants than adults are eligible for medicaid which results in fewer ms patients than is patients participating in the medicaid program 
as a result of the increased proportion of ms prescriptions in the fourth quarter of  the rebate and chargeback amounts as a percentage of gross sales were lower as compared to the full year at december  and  sales related reserves included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were as follows december  in s medicaid rebates government chargebacks product returns credit memoranda policy product returns product replacement policy other inventories as of december  our net raw material and finished goods inventories totaled million 
we maintain inventory reserves primarily for excess and obsolete inventory due to the expiration of shelf life of a product 
in estimating inventory excess and obsolescence reserves  we analyze i the expiration date  ii our sales forecasts  and iii historical demand 
judgment is required in determining whether the forecasted sales information is sufficiently reliable to enable us to reasonably estimate excess and obsolete inventory 
if actual future usage and demand for our products is less favorable than projected  additional inventory write offs may be required in the future which would increase our cost of product sales in the period of any write offs 
we intend to control inventory levels of our products purchased by our customers 
customer inventories may be compared to both internal and external databases to determine adequate inventory levels 
we may monitor our product shipments to customers and compare these shipments against prescription demand for our individual products 

table of contents intangible and long lived assets as of december  our intangible and long lived assets consisted of goodwill of  generated from a merger in  net purchased technology of million related to our acquisition of doral and  of net property and equipment 
the costs related to our acquisition of doral are being amortized over an estimated life of years 
the determination of whether or not our intangible and long lived assets are impaired and the expected useful lives of purchased technology involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require a write down of our recorded asset balances and a reduction in the expected useful life of our purchased technology 
such a write down of our recorded asset balances or reduction in the expected useful life of our purchased technology would increase our operating expenses 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment may have occurred 
our fair value is compared to the carrying value of our net assets  including goodwill 
if the fair value is greater than the carrying amount  then no impairment is indicated 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets  consisting of property and equipment and purchased technology  for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the net undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use or disposition of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  the assets carrying value is adjusted to fair value 
as of december  and  no impairment had been indicated 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense  net of estimated pre vesting forfeitures  ratably over the vesting period of the award 
we selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value method for our awards 
calculating share based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the share based awards  stock price volatility  and pre vesting forfeitures 
we estimated the expected term of stock options granted for the year ended december  based on the historical term of our stock option awards 
we estimated the expected term of stock options granted for the years ended december  and based on the simplified method provided in staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
we estimated the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the pre vesting forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
our net income for the year ended december  includes million of share based compensation expense related to employees and non employee members of our board of directors  of which million is related to our employee stock purchase plan espp 
our net income for the year ended december  includes million of share based compensation expense related to employees and non employee members of our board of directors 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested grants of stock options and awards of restricted stock is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
on february   our board of directors approved a reduction in the offering period of the espp from months to months effective with the offering period that began on september   eliminated the ability of plan participants to increase their contribution levels during an offering period and authorized the addition of 
table of contents  shares to the espp 
in addition  our board of directors approved an amendment on april   to permanently reduce the maximum offering period available from months to months and to permanently remove the ability of espp participants to increase their contributions during an offering period 
these amendments to the espp were approved by our board of directors on february   and april  and by our shareholders at our annual shareholders meeting on may  these plan changes to the espp were effective with the offering period that began on september  and could lead to lower expenses for the espp in future periods 
lease termination liability we entered into an agreement to sublease laboratory and office space  including laboratory equipment  at our hayward  california facility in july  due to the termination of our then existing drug discovery programs 
the sublease on our hayward facility expired in july our obligations under the hayward master lease extend through november during the fourth quarter of  the sublessee notified us that they did not intend to extend the sublease beyond the end of july we determined that there was no loss associated with the hayward facility when we initially subleased the space as we expected cash inflows from the sublease to exceed our rent cost over the term of the master lease 
however  we reevaluated this in when the sublessee notified us that it would not be renewing the sublease beyond july as a result  we computed a loss and liability on the sublease in the fourth quarter of in accordance with financial interpretation no 
accounting for a loss on a sublease  an interpretation of fasb and apb opinion no 
and fasb technical bulletin  accounting for the loss on a sublease not involving the disposal of a segment 
as of december  and  the estimated liability related to the hayward facility totaled million and million  respectively  and is included in lease termination and deferred rent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of the liability was determined using a credit adjusted risk free rate to discount the estimated future net cash flows  consisting of the minimum lease payments under the master lease  net of estimated sublease rental income that could reasonably be obtained from the property 
the most significant assumption in estimating the lease termination liability relates to our estimate of future sublease income 
we base our estimate of sublease income  in part  on the opinion of independent real estate experts  current market conditions  and rental rates  among other factors 
adjustments to the lease termination liability will be required if actual sublease income differs from amounts currently expected 
we review all assumptions used in determining the estimated liability quarterly and revise our estimate of the liability to reflect changes in circumstances 
effective november   we subleased  square feet of the facility through april and effective february  we subleased the remaining  square feet through the remainder of the term of the master lease 
these subleases cover a portion of our lease commitment  and all of our insurance  taxes and common area maintenance 
as of december   we are obligated to pay rent on the hayward facility of million 
over the remaining term of the master lease we anticipate that we will receive approximately million in sublease income to be used to pay a portion of our hayward facility obligation 
we are also required to recognize an on going accretion expense representing the difference between the undiscounted net cash flows and the discounted net cash flows over the remaining term of the hayward master lease using the interest method 
the accretion amount represents an on going adjustment to the estimated liability 
the on going accretion expense and any revisions to the liability are recorded in selling  general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during the years ended december   and we recognized total expense of  million and  respectively  related to the hayward facility 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax 
table of contents exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets  which is ultimately dependent upon us generating future taxable income 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if it is not considered more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets  we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
changes in the valuation allowance based on our assessment will result in an income tax benefit if the valuation allowance is decreased and an income tax expense if the valuation allowance is increased 
based on taxable income for  cumulative taxable income for the three most recent years  and anticipated taxable income for  we reversed the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in that we believed would be recovered based on anticipated taxable income in in  we reversed the remaining valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that we believe will be recovered based on anticipated taxable income in and future years 
these reversals resulted in an income tax benefit of million in and million in which reduced our income tax expense 
any changes in the valuation allowance based upon our future assessment will result in an income tax expense if the valuation allowance is increased 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  and federal and california research and development tax credits of  and  respectively 
federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling million are subject to annual limitations and will be available from through  as a result of federal ownership change limitations 
of this amount  million of federal net operating loss carryforwards are available to reduce our taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and the federal credit carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in the years through  if not utilized 
utilization of the company s net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may still be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions for ownership changes after december  such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards available as of december  before utilization 
we implemented the provisions of financial interpretation no 
as of january  this resulted in the reversal of fully reserved deferred tax assets totaling  which relate to uncertain tax positions  and the related valuation allowance 
these unrecognized tax benefits  if recognized in full  would reduce our income tax expense by  and result in adjustments to other tax accounts  primarily deferred taxes 
we had no increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits in and and do not currently expect any significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total net sales years ended december  increase change in s net sales total net sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  from the year ended december  for the years ended december  and all net sales were in the neurology therapeutic area 

table of contents net sales of acthar for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million during the same period in the increase in net sales resulted from a full year under the new acthar pricing level implemented in august in august we announced a new strategy and business model for acthar  and initiated a new pricing level for acthar that was effective august  under the new acthar strategy  our sales price to curascript  our specialty distributor of acthar  increased to  per vial based on a list price of  per vial 
effective june   the discounted sales price to curascript increased to  per vial based on a list price of  per vial 
the list price prior to the new pricing level was  per vial 
while total acthar units shipped have decreased since the implementation of the new acthar strategy  we shipped  acthar units to our specialty distributor during the year ended december  this continued ordering coupled with a positive pattern of insurance reimbursement and rapid patient access to acthar has resulted in a significant increase in our net sales 
however  future acthar orders may be impacted by several factors  including inventory practices at specialty and hospital pharmacies  greater use of patient assistance programs  the overall pattern of usage by the healthcare community  including medicaid and government supported entities  the fda approval of a competitive product  and the reimbursement policies of insurance companies 
during we increased our sales effort related to the use of acthar for the treatment of exacerbations associated with ms  an indication for which acthar is already approved 
the increased sales effort resulted in positive growth trends in prescriptions of acthar for the treatment of exacerbations associated with ms 
acthar net sales for ms as a percentage of total acthar net sales increased in the fourth quarter of more than as compared to the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  acthar net sales for ms represented over of total net sales for acthar 
there can be no guarantee that these positive growth trends will continue 
our specialty distributor ships acthar to specialty pharmacies and hospitals to meet end user demand 
we track our own acthar shipments daily  but those shipments vary compared to end user demand because of seasonal usage and changes in inventory levels at specialty pharmacies and hospitals 
acthar shipments may be impacted by seasonality as well as quarter to quarter fluctuations driven by the relatively small is patient population 
during  acthar shipments did not fluctuate significantly  except in february  november and december 
however  since then  shipments have rebounded and are now trending above average 
we believe these fluctuations are principally due to the low incidence of is  as a relatively small number of cases can create meaningful fluctuations 
we will continue to monitor these factors as there may be volatility in our acthar shipments and end user demand in future periods 
as required by federal regulations  we provide a rebate related to product dispensed to medicaid eligible patients 
in addition  certain government supported entities are permitted to purchase our products for a nominal amount from our customers who charge back the significant discount to us 
these medicaid rebates and government chargebacks are estimated by us each quarter and reduce our gross sales in the determination of our net sales 
effective january   the amount we rebate for each acthar vial dispensed to a medicaid eligible patient is approximately  higher than our price to our specialty distributor 
we have estimated that approximately of our estimated acthar end user unit demand is used by patients covered by medicaid and other government related programs 
for the year ended december   acthar gross sales were reduced by to account for the estimated amount of medicaid rebates and government chargebacks 
a greater percentage of infants than adults are eligible for medicaid which results in fewer ms patients than is patients participating in the medicaid program 
as a result of the increased proportion of ms prescriptions in the fourth quarter of  the rebate and chargeback amounts as a percentage of gross sales were lower as compared to the full year cost of sales and gross profit years ended december  increase change in s cost of sales gross profit gross margin 
table of contents cost of sales for the year ended december  increased million from the year ended december  cost of sales includes material cost  packaging  warehousing and distribution  product liability insurance  royalties  quality control which primarily includes product stability testing  quality assurance and reserves for excess or obsolete inventory 
stability testing is required on each production lot of acthar and is conducted at third party laboratories at periodic intervals subsequent to manufacturing 
stability testing costs are expensed as incurred 
we incur a royalty of on total net sales of acthar to a third party and a royalty of of annual net sales over million to another third party 
the increase in cost of sales was due primarily to an increase of million in royalties on acthar due to the increase in net sales during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in and an increase of approximately  in distribution costs in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in these increases were partially offset by decreases in product stability testing and inventory obsolescence totaling approximately  in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the gross margin was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the gross margin in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was due primarily to the increase in net sales resulting from a full year under the new acthar pricing level implemented in august selling  general and administrative years ended december  increase change in s selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the same period in the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was due primarily to an increase in share based compensation expense and general costs associated with the support of our new acthar strategy  offset in part by lower expenses associated with our hayward facility and lower headcount related costs resulting from the reduction of our field organization in the second quarter of we incurred a total non cash charge of million for sfas no 
r share based compensation for the year ended december  of this amount  million was included in selling  general and administrative expenses  an increase of approximately million as compared to the same period in the increase in share based compensation expense in the year ended december  was primarily associated with our employee stock purchase plan 
of the total non cash charge of million in the year ended december  for share based compensation expense  million was related to our employee stock purchase plan 
as a result of the significant increase in our stock price during the fourth quarter of  many plan participants increased their contributions to maximum levels for the month offering period that began on september  this resulted in a significant increase in the non cash sfas no 
r expense for that month offering period 
in february  our board of directors approved a reduction in the offering period from months to months effective with the offering period that began on september   eliminated the ability of plan participants to increase their contribution levels during an offering period and approved an amendment authorizing the addition of  shares to the plan 
in addition  our board of directors approved an amendment on april   to permanently reduce the maximum offering period available from months to months and to permanently remove the ability of espp participants to increase their contributions during an offering period 
these amendments to the plan were approved by shareholders at our annual shareholders meeting on may  we estimate that these changes could reduce the non cash sfas no 
r expense associated with our employee stock purchase plan beginning with the offering period that began on september  general costs associated with the support of our acthar strategy increased by approximately million in the year ended december  as compared to general costs associated with our acthar strategy incurred during the same period in expenses associated with our hayward facility decreased by approximately  in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the decrease is due primarily to the inclusion of losses 
table of contents totaling  in the year ended december  resulting from revisions of our estimate of our hayward lease liability 
headcount related costs included in selling  general and administrative expense  excluding share based compensation  decreased by approximately  as compared to the same period in selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  includes severance benefits and other associated costs related to the reduction of our field organization and the departure of our former chief executive officer in the second quarter of as of december   we had sales force representatives 
in january we announced that we are increasing our sales force to representatives in order to build upon continued positive growth trends in prescriptions of acthar for the treatment of exacerbations associated with ms  an indication for which acthar is already approved 
we anticipate completing this phase of our sales force expansion by the end of the first quarter of depending upon the success of the first phase of our sales force expansion  a second phase of our sales force expansion to approximately representatives could occur later in research and development years ended december  increase change in s research and development research and development expense for the year ended december  increased million from the year ended december  costs included in research and development relate primarily to costs related to the resubmission of our acthar snda for is to the fda  our product development efforts  outside services related to medical and regulatory affairs  compliance activities  and costs associated with our medical science liaisons

the net tax benefit is due to the reversal of this valuation allowance  as we determined in that  based on anticipated taxable income in and future years  it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets at december  would be realized 
for the year ended december   we were able to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset the majority of our taxable income 
in addition  based on taxable income in the third and fourth quarters of  cumulative taxable income for the three most recent years ended december  and anticipated taxable income for  we determined in the fourth quarter of that it was more likely than not that some of our deferred tax assets at december  would be realized

the utilization of the tax loss carryforwards to offset our taxable income is limited in the calculation of amt and as a result we recorded a current tax expense for amt for the year ended december  at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  and federal and california research and development tax credits of  and  respectively

while total acthar units shipped have decreased since the implementation of the new acthar strategy  we shipped  acthar units to our specialty distributor at the new pricing level from the implementation of the new acthar strategy on august  through december  this continued ordering coupled with a positive pattern of insurance reimbursement resulted in a significant increase in our net sales for the year ended december  our specialty distributor ships acthar to specialty pharmacies and hospitals to meet end user demand 
we track our own acthar shipments daily  but those shipments vary compared to end user demand because of seasonal usage and changes in inventory levels at specialty pharmacies and hospitals 
we estimate monthly acthar end user demand using patient referral data collected from our reimbursement support center and analysis of ordering patterns from specialty and hospital pharmacies 
we generally receive this information during the day period following the end of each month 
we shipped  vials of acthar to our specialty distributor during the fourth quarter of in the months since the august  price increase  acthar shipments to our specialty distributor have ranged from a low of vials in september to a high of vials in october during the fourth quarter of  there was an initial build up of acthar inventories within the newly established specialty pharmacy network that distributes acthar 
this resulted in acthar shipments during the fourth quarter that exceeded our end user demand estimate 
acthar shipments may be impacted by seasonality as well as quarter to quarter fluctuations driven by the relatively small is patient population 
we will continue to monitor these factors as there may be volatility in our acthar shipments and end user demand in future periods 
as required by federal regulations  we provide a rebate related to product dispensed to medicaid eligible patients and certain government supported entities are permitted to purchase our products for a nominal amount from our customers who charge back the significant discount to us

acthar gross sales were reduced by and to account for the estimated amount of medicaid rebates and government chargebacks for the fourth quarter and year ended december   respectively 
the medicaid rebate amount per unit is determined based on a formula established by statute and is subject to review and modification by the administrators of the medicaid program 
in connection with the implementation of the new pricing strategy for acthar  coupled with recent clarifications of the statute in july by program administrators  we initiated an extensive review of the medicaid statute and regulations 
after such review and consultation with our regulatory legal counsel  we prospectively modified how we determine our rebate amount per unit to conform with the statute

recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp fas 
fsp fas clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and illustrates how an entity would determine fair value when the market for a financial asset is not active 
fsp fas provides guidance on how an entity s own assumptions about cash flows and discount rates should be considered when measuring fair value when relevant market data does not exist  how observable market information in an inactive or dislocated market affects fair value measurements and how the use of broker and pricing service quotes should be considered when applying fair value measurements

the adoption of fsp fas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

often the activities associated with these arrangements are conducted by the collaborators without the creation of a separate legal entity that is  the arrangement is operated as a virtual joint venture 
the arrangements generally provide that the collaborators will share  based on contractually defined calculations  the profits or losses from the associated activities 
periodically  the collaborators share financial information related to product revenues generated if any and costs incurred that may trigger a sharing payment for the combined profits or losses 
the consensus requires collaborators in such an arrangement to present the result of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
eitf is effective for collaborative arrangements in place at the beginning of the annual period beginning after december  we do not expect that the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations
