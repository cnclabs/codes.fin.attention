the fair value of our long term debt was estimated based on the current rates available to us for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities 
under this method  the fair value of our debt was estimated to be million at october  we determined the estimated fair value amount by using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the fair value estimate presented herein is not necessarily indicative of the amount that we or holders of the instruments could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value 
although payments under certain of our operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  these operating leases do not expose us to material interest rate risk
