item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and those listed under risks factors 
we have attempted to identify forward looking statements in this report by placing an asterisk before paragraphs containing such material 
executive level overview trimble s focus is on combining positioning technology with wireless communication and application capabilities to create system level solutions that enhance productivity and accuracy for our customers 
the majority of our markets are end user markets  including engineering and construction firms  governmental organizations  public safety workers  farmers and companies who must manage fleets of mobile workers and assets 
in our advanced devices segment  we also provide components to original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their products 
in the end user markets  we provide a system that includes a hardware platform that may contain software and customer support 
some examples of our solutions include products that automate and simplify the process of surveying land  products that automate the utilization of equipment such as tractors and bulldozers  products that enable a company to manage its mobile workforce and assets  and products that allow municipalities to manage their fixed assets 
in addition  we also provide software applications on a stand alone basis 
for example  we provide software for project management on construction sites 
solutions targeted at the end user make up a significant majority of our revenue 
to create compelling products  we must attain an understanding of the end users needs and work flow  and how location based technology can enable that end user to work faster  more efficiently  and more accurately 
we use this knowledge to create highly innovative products that change the way work is done by the end user 
with the exception of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments  our products are generally sold through a dealer channel  and it is crucial that we maintain a proficient global  third party distribution channel 
we continued to execute our strategy with a series of actions that can be summarized in four categories 
reinforcing our position in existing markets we believe these markets provide us with additional  substantial potential for substituting our technology for traditional methods 
we are continuing to develop new products and to strengthen our distribution channels in order to expand our market opportunity 
in our field solutions segment  we introduced the aggps ez guide lightbar guidance system  gps pathfinder proxrt receiver  trimble geoexplorer series and the new juno series 
we announced that the city of joliet  illinois public utilities department and the baton rouge water company in louisiana selected trimble s fieldport software to enhance utility field operations 
in our engineering and construction segment  we introduced the trimble mep layout solution  trimble coastal center software  and trimble netr gnss reference receiver 
we also introduced further enhancements to our complete surveying portfolio as part of its connected site solutions new models of the trimble s total station with options for monitoring and tunneling applications  a new version of trimble business center  a scalable trimble vx spatial station  and improved field to office solutions for german surveyors 
in our mobile solutions segment  we announced that carrier corporation is rolling out trimble s mobile resource management mrm solution within its fleet 
all of these products strengthened our competitive position and created new value for the user 
extending our position in existing markets through new product categories we are utilizing the strength of the trimble brand in our markets to expand our revenue by bringing new products to existing users 
in our field solutions segment  we introduced agriculture manager asset management system aggps ez office software 
in our engineering and construction segment  we introduced new products  such as a new sensor for the trimble ccs compaction control system that provides real time material density information to earthworks operators 
we were also chosen to supply trimble vrs technology to establish a nationwide gnss infrastructure network for turkey called cors tr continuous operating reference station turkey or tusaga aktif and the republic of croatia called the croatian positioning system cropos 
we launched trimble vrs now service in madrid  spain and in the state of florida to provide surveyors  civil engineers and geospatial professionals in the area with instant access to real time kinematic rtk gnss corrections without the need for a base station 
these are all examples of bringing new products to existing markets 

table of contents bringing existing technology to new markets we continue to reinforce our position in existing markets and position ourselves in newer markets that will serve as important sources of future growth 
our efforts in africa  china  india  the middle east and russia reflected improving financial results 
we announced a gps software technology licensing agreement with marvell  a leader in the development of storage  communications and consumer silicon 
the licensing agreement will enable marvell to provide customers with comprehensive gps solutions based on innovative architectures that are tailored for high performance and low overall system power consumption 
entering new market segments during we acquired companies  technologies or introduced new product categories that have allowed us to enter new market segments 
in our engineering and construction segment  we acquired two accessory companies  crain and seco  whose products complement our existing construction product offerings 
additionally  we acquired three companies  g o d  rolleimetric and toposys  which through new product offerings  expand the emerging geospatial markets 
in our field solutions segment  we acquired trucount and rawson control systems  which through new products  expand our agricultural market segment 
we also acquired the fastmap and geosite software assets from korec  which expand our gis solutions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting polices 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
contracts and or customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
revenue for orders is not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer 
we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point 
our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point 
if no precise point is indicated by the buyer  we may choose within the place or range stipulated where the carrier will take the goods into carrier s charge 
other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer 
shipping and handling costs are included in the cost of goods sold 
revenue to distributors and resellers is recognized upon shipment  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
distributors and resellers do not have a right of return 

table of contents revenue from purchased extended warranty and support agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty support period 
we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 
we apply statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  to products where the embedded software is more than incidental to the functionality of the hardware 
this determination requires significant judgment including a consideration of factors such as marketing  research and development efforts and any post customer contract support pcs relating to the embedded software 
our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on renewal rates 
the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method 
license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and there are no remaining obligations 
revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the pcs agreement 
we apply eitf issue  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  for hosted arrangements which the customer does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a third party s hardware 
subscription revenue related to our hosted arrangements is recognized ratably over the contract period 
upfront fees for our hosted solution primarily consist of amounts for the in vehicle enabling hardware device and peripherals  if any 
for upfront fees relating to proprietary hardware where the firmware is more than incidental to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition  we defer the upfront fees at installation and recognize them ratably over the minimum service contract period  generally one to five years 
product costs are also deferred and amortized over such period 
in accordance with eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when a non software sale involves multiple elements the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element is met 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns reserve  was million as of january   as compared with million as of december  the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of january  and december   respectively 
we evaluate ongoing collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances  credit quality  historical experience  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates experienced in the ordinary course of business 
the reserve for sales returns as of january  and december  was million and million  respectively  for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our revenue could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation our inventories  net balance was million as of january  as compared with million as of december  our inventory allowances as of january  were million  as compared with million as of december  our inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  are made for estimated excess  obsolescence  or impaired balances 
factors influencing these adjustments include decline in demand  technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration  and quality issues 
if actual factors are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 
our valuation allowance is attributable to  primarily  acquisition related net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards 
management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these deferred tax assets  and  accordingly  a valuation allowance has been provided for such amounts 
when sfas r  business combinations  becomes effective  any valuation allowance adjustment associated with an acquisition that closed prior to january  and after the measurement period will be recorded through income tax expense whereas the current accounting treatment under sfas would require any adjustment to be recognized through the purchase price 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible  identifiable intangible assets  and in process research and development acquired in a business combination 
intangible assets acquired individually  with a group of other assets  or in a business combination are recorded at fair value 
identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights  patents  licenses  technology  acquired backlog and trademarks 
identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight line method  reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets  and have estimated useful lives ranging from one to twelve years with a weighted average useful life of years 
goodwill is not subject to amortization  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment  applying a fair value based test 
impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a two step process 
first  impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
in step two  the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill  the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 
depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets and other long lived assets is provided using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model  or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets or other long lived assets differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised  the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value will be expensed and the residual value is depreciated over its revised remaining useful life 
these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value 
warranty costs the liability for product warranties was million as of january   as compared with million as of december  we accrue for warranty costs as part of cost of sales based on associated material product costs  technical support labor costs  and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf 
our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
the products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from days to three years  and in some instances up to years 

table of contents while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 
stock based compensation beginning in fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  based on estimated fair values 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal  and includes compensation expense for awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated using the black scholes options pricing model in accordance with the provisions of sfas and compensation expense for awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated using a binomial valuation model in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the fair value of rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates  and expected dividends 
in addition  the binomial model incorporates actual option pricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option s contractual term 
beginning in fiscal  our expected stock price volatility for stock purchase rights has been based on implied volatilities of traded options on our stock and our expected stock price volatility for stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock price volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the stock option and the implied volatility of traded options 
the use of implied volatilities was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock with terms similar to our awards and also upon our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
however  because the expected life of our stock options is greater than the terms of our traded options  we used a combination of our historical stock price volatility commensurate with the expected life of our stock options and implied volatility of traded options 
we estimated the expected life of the awards based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the options and purchase rights 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the awards 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our expected dividend yield is zero 
because stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal  and is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
in addition  valuation models  including the black scholes and binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination  or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements

our future growth will depend in part on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which we currently compete as well as our ability to continue to identify and develop new markets for our products 
general and administrative expense increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to new g a expenses as a result of acquisitions  partially offset by decreased compensation related expense and reduced deferred compensation liabilities 
spending overall was at approximately of revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal general and administrative expense increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to new g a expenses as a result of acquisitions  an increase in compensation related expense  and an increase in tax and legal fees 
spending overall was at approximately of revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal other operating expenses restructuring charges restructuring expense for the three years ended january  was as follows in thousands severance and benefits during fiscal  restructuring expense of million was related to decisions to streamline processes and reduce the cost structure of the company  with approximately employees affected worldwide 
of the total restructuring expense  million is shown as a separate line within operating expense on our consolidated statements of income  and million is included within cost of sales 
additionally  million is related to the engineering and construction segment and million is related to the mobile solutions segment 
as a result of the above decisions  we expect restructuring activities in the engineering and construction segment to result in additional restructuring expense totaling approximately million through the first quarter of additional restructuring activities have been announced in the first fiscal quarter of 
table of contents during fiscal   restructuring expense of million was for charges associated with the company s acquisition of road 
the restructuring expense was related to the acceleration of vesting of employee stock options for certain terminated road employees  of which million was settled in cash and million was recorded as shareholders equity 
restructuring costs associated with a business combination in addition to the restructuring expense in fiscal  costs associated with exiting activities of companies we acquired in fiscal was million  consisting of severance and benefits costs

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 
market interest rate risk our cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds  treasury bills  commercial paper fdic insured  interest and non interest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits for fiscal and the main objective of these instruments was safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return  without significantly increasing risk 
due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents  we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our senior secured credit facilities 
our credit facility is comprised of an unsecured revolving credit agreement with a maturity date of february we may borrow funds under the revolving credit agreement in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest as described under note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of january   we had an outstanding balance on the revolving credit line of million and during fiscal  we repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance on our term loan 
a hypothetical increase in the three month libor rates could result in approximately million annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances 
the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future 
furthermore  the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time 
as a result  actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain trade and inter company receivables and payables  primarily denominated in australian  canadian  japanese  new zealand  south african and swedish currencies  the euro  and the british pound 
these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts 
these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to three months in original maturity 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes 
foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of january  and december  are summarized as follows in thousands january  december  nominal amount fair value nominal amount fair value forward contracts purchased sold we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy
