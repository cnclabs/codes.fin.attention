our discussion contains forward looking statements which are based upon our current expectations and which involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth in the cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements in the general information section of this report and the risk factors listed in part i  item a of this report 
our fiscal year generally ends on the saturday closest to august of each year  which generally results in an extra week every six years 
fiscal and fiscal were week years compared with a week year in fiscal the second quarter of fiscal and the second quarter of fiscal included weeks compared with weeks in the second quarter of fiscal executive overview we operate a chain of more than  general merchandise retail discount stores in states  providing primarily low to middle income consumers with a selection of competitively priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores 
our merchandise assortment includes consumables  home products  apparel and accessories  and seasonal and electronics 
we sell merchandise at prices that generally range from less than to during fiscal as compared with fiscal  our net sales increased to billion  our net income increased to million  and our diluted net income per common share increased to 
comparable store sales stores open more than months for fiscal increased compared with fiscal our strong results during fiscal were due primarily to strong sales of consumable merchandise and improvements in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales 
although the economic environment remained difficult for our customers during fiscal  with rapidly rising unemployment and a decline in average hours worked  we believe our customers benefited from lower energy costs and certain government stimulus programs 
we believe our strategy of providing both value and convenience continues to resonate well with budget minded consumers 
during fiscal  we experienced an increase in customer traffic and the dollar value of the average transaction 
our customer research suggests that our core low income customer is shopping us more frequently and spending more when they shop at our stores 
in addition  we are seeing growth in the number of shopping trips and average transaction from more middle income customers 
the various components affecting our results for fiscal are discussed in more detail below 
during fiscal  we focused on driving revenues  mitigating risk and managing costs through the following key initiatives we continued the expansion of our assortment of traffic driving consumables  providing customers with more of what they need in a challenging economic environment 
during fiscal  we initiated efforts to re align space in our stores to accommodate strong customer demand for consumable merchandise and improve the in store shopping experience 
approximately of the chain was impacted by these efforts during fiscal to strengthen the family dollar brand with customers and to reinforce the values we offer  we focused on increasing the productivity and returns of our advertising and customer communications and improving our in store execution of promotional events 
we continued the roll out of new register and point of sale technology in approximately  additional stores 
as of august   approximately  stores were operating on the new technology platform 
the new platform facilitates the acceptance of additional payment types  including credit cards and food stamps  and includes a number of computer based tools designed to provide our store managers with better training  analytics and work flow management 
through our price management work  the continued development of our private label offering  and our global sourcing efforts  we offset the impact of the shift in the merchandise mix to more lower margin consumable merchandise 
we continued to focus on inventory productivity  and we lowered our inventory levels in more discretionary merchandise categories 
during fiscal  total inventory decreased and inventory per store decreased  both in comparison to fiscal lower inventory levels are making our stores easier to shop and reducing our exposure to seasonal markdowns 
we also believe that lower inventory levels are resulting in lower inventory shrinkage and a reduction in workers compensation and general liability claims 

table of contents reflecting the uncertainty in the current economic environment  we continued our measured pace of new store openings so that we can focus on improving our returns on existing assets 
we opened stores and closed stores 
fiscal outlook during fiscal  we plan to build on the improvements we made during fiscal and maintain our focus on four key priorities increase relevancy to the customer  drive increased profitability  manage risk and build great employee teams 
to increase our relevancy to the customer we plan to continue re aligning the space in our stores to better meet customer demand and improve the in store shopping experience 
in addition  we plan to complete the rollout of our new register and point of sale technology during fiscal we also plan to adjust our store operating hours to provide greater convenience for our customers and continue to expand our customer research efforts 
in order to drive increased profitability  we plan to continue investing in initiatives that drive top line growth  and we remain focused on cost management 
in addition to the initiatives already discussed  we plan to enhance our private label offering and global sourcing efforts and make additional investments to strengthen our pricing efforts 
we plan to continue managing our inventory risk by constraining purchases of discretionary merchandise 
we also plan to leverage the investments we have made in our project accelerate initiative and global sourcing efforts to improve inventory productivity and quality 
we believe that our long term success is dependent on our ability to create strong employee teams that can adjust and respond quickly to ever changing conditions 
we plan to continue to invest in building a stronger family dollar culture and great employee teams 
we also plan to continue to focus on improving employee retention 
during fiscal  we expect sales will continue to be strongest in the consumables category  as customers continue to constrain their discretionary spending 
we expect cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  will continue to be pressured by the shift in the merchandise mix to more consumable merchandise 
we plan to offset this pressure through lower markdowns  the enhancement of our private label program  improvements in price optimization  and lower inventory shrinkage 
we expect selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  will be pressured as we continue to make revenue driving investments  including the re alignment of space in our stores  the roll out of new register and point of sale technology and the expansion of store operating hours 
see part i  item of this report for more information on our current strategic initiatives

comparable store sales includes stores that have been open more than months 
stores that have been renovated  relocated  or expanded are included in the comparable store sales calculation to the extent that they had sales during comparable weeks in each year 
the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry 
as a result  our comparable store sales calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  were negatively impacted by the loss of one week during the reporting period 
fiscal was a week year compared to a week year in fiscal the additional week was approximately of net sales in fiscal the increase in comparable store sales in fiscal resulted from an increase in customer traffic  as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores and an increase in the dollar value of the average customer transaction 
during fiscal  the customer count increased approximately and the average customer transaction increased approximately to compared to fiscal sales during fiscal  on a comparable store basis  were strongest in consumables  driven primarily by sales of food

cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to lower freight expense  lower inventory shrinkage  and lower seasonal markdowns 
in addition  higher purchase mark ups more than offset the effect of stronger sales of lower margin consumable merchandise 
freight expense benefited from lower diesel costs and increased transportation productivity and efficiency 
we believe that inventory shrinkage benefited from higher store manager retention  lower levels of discretionary merchandise and improved analytics and monitoring processes 
as a result of the shift in the merchandise sales mix to more consumable merchandise and our continued focus on managing inventory risk  we lowered inventory levels in our discretionary merchandise categories  which resulted in lower seasonal markdowns  especially during the first half of fiscal the increase in purchase mark ups was due primarily to our price management work  including zone pricing and price optimization 
the increase in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to increased sales of lower margin consumable merchandise 
the consumer product safety improvement act of was signed into law in august the new legislation addresses a number of consumer product safety issues  including the permissible levels of lead and phthalates in certain products 
during fiscal  we incurred markdown expense of approximately million in response to the new legislation

sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to higher incentive compensation approximately of net sales and higher insurance expense approximately of net sales 
most other costs decreased as a percentage of net sales  including payroll costs approximately of net sales and occupancy costs approximately of net sales  as a result of a increase in comparable store sales and our continued focus on expense control 
the increase in incentive compensation was due to certain adjustments to bonus and other performance based compensation accruals to reflect our strong performance during fiscal we continued to see favorable trends in workers compensation and general liability claims during fiscal  but the rate of improvement was lower as compared to fiscal  resulting in an increase in insurance expense as a percentage of net sales 
the increase in sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to an increase in occupancy costs and an increase in advertising costs 
in addition  most costs in fiscal were de leveraged as a result of low single digit comparable store sales growth 
these increases offset a decrease in insurance costs and a decrease in professional fees

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal these amounts have enabled us to fund our regular operating needs  capital expenditure program  cash dividend payments  interest payments  and share repurchases 
we believe operating cash flows and existing credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity for our ongoing operations and growth initiatives 
credit facilities on december   we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for short term borrowings of up to million 
the credit facility replaced our million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on january  the credit facility has an initial term of days and includes two one year extensions that require lender consent 
the credit facility also includes a one year term out option that does not require lender consent 
any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates 
we also maintain a million unsecured revolving credit facility expiring on august  any borrowings under this credit facility also accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates 
outstanding standby letters of credit million as of august  reduce the borrowing capacity of the million credit facility 
there were no borrowings under the credit facilities during fiscal  compared with million borrowed and repaid in fiscal the credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants  which include a consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization ratio  a fixed charge coverage ratio  and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio

our merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal were lower than at the end of fiscal inventory per store at the end of fiscal was approximately lower than inventory per store at the end of fiscal the decrease in total inventory and inventory per store during fiscal resulted from efforts to improve our inventory productivity  including the continuation of an aggressive markdown strategy that began in fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal were million compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in capital expenditures during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in distribution and corporate office related projects  which offset increases in technology related projects and improvements and upgrades to existing stores 
the increase in capital expenditures during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to an increase in existing store improvements and upgrades and an increase in technology investments 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be between and million and relate primarily to store technology infrastructure and other technology related projects  new store openings  existing stores  to include expansions  relocations and renovations  and distribution center improvements

as of the end of fiscal  these cash and cash equivalents and investment securities balances were million and million  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to an increase in net income  partially offset by changes in income tax receivable payable amounts 
the changes in the income tax receivable payable amounts were primarily due to a tax refund received during fiscal in connection with the formation of our captive insurance subsidiary 
cash provided by operating activities increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to changes in merchandise inventories and other working capital items in the ordinary course of business 
cash flows from investing activities during fiscal  we had a cash outflow from investing activities of million compared to a cash outflow of million in fiscal the change is due primarily to changes in the purchase sale of investment securities 
due to volatility in the financial markets and the liquidity issues surrounding our auction rate securities  we did not purchase any investment securities during fiscal and only liquidated million of investment securities 
during fiscal  we had a net cash outflow of million related to investment securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our auction rate securities 
cash used for investing activities increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to an increase in capital expenditures

table of contents critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories our inventories are valued using the retail method  based on retail prices less mark on percentages  which approximates the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market 
we record adjustments to inventory through cost of goods sold when retail price reductions  or markdowns  are taken against on hand inventory 
in addition  we make estimates and judgments regarding  among other things  initial markups  markdowns  future demand for specific product categories and market conditions  all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation 
these estimates and judgments are based on the application of a consistent methodology each period 
while we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for these components  if actual demand or market conditions are different than our projections  it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded estimates 
this risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal merchandise 
we estimate inventory losses for damaged  lost or stolen inventory inventory shrinkage for the period from the most recent physical inventory to the financial statement date 
the accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage was million as of the end of fiscal and million as of the end of fiscal the accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on the trailing twelve month actual inventory shrinkage rate and can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of the physical inventory counts 
stores receive a physical inventory at least annually 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal property and equipment we state property and equipment at cost 
we calculate depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
for leasehold improvements  this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease generally five years or the asset s useful economic life 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
we generally do not assign salvage value to property and equipment 
we review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
historically  our impairment losses on fixed assets  which typically relate to normal store closings  have not been material to our financial position and results of operations 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation and classification of property and equipment during fiscal see note and note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on property and equipment 
insurance liabilities we are primarily self insured for health care  property loss  workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability costs 
these costs are significant primarily due to the large number of our retail locations and employees 
our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported  less amounts paid against such claims  and are not discounted 
we review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates 
we also use information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical  workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability claims 
the insurance liabilities we record are mainly influenced by changes in payroll expense  sales  number of vehicles  and the frequency and severity of claims 
the estimates of more recent claims are more volatile and more likely to change than older claims 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends  then we may be required to record additional expense or a reduction to expense  which could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
our liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability costs were million as of the end of fiscal and million as of the end of fiscal there were no other material estimates for insurance liabilities during fiscal or fiscal our insurance expense during fiscal and fiscal was impacted by changes in our liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability costs 
see our discussion of sg a expenses under results of operations above for more information 

table of contents contingent income tax liabilities we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business 
our contingent income tax liabilities are estimated based on the methodology prescribed in fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which we adopted as of the beginning of fiscal fin prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as by current income tax trends 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions were million as of the end of fiscal and million as of the end of fiscal there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent income tax liabilities during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our contingent income tax liabilities 
contingent legal liabilities we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims 
our accruals  if any  related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable 
we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss 
we re evaluate the claims and proceedings each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available  and we adjust or establish accruals  if necessary 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
our total legal liabilities were million as of the end of fiscal and million as of the end of fiscal there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent legal liabilities during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our contingent legal liabilities 
stock based compensation expense we adopted sfas r during the first quarter of fiscal sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees based on estimated fair values 
the determination of the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we also grant performance share rights and adjust compensation expense each quarter based on the ultimate number of shares expected to be issued 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense recorded under sfas r may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period 
our results for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal include stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on sfas r 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing and cash management activities 
we maintain unsecured revolving credit facilities at variable rates of interest to meet the short term needs of our expansion program and seasonal inventory increases 
during fiscal  we did not incur any interest expense related to our credit facilities 
during fiscal we incurred million in interest expense related to our credit facilities 
interest incurred during fiscal related to our credit facilities was not material 
our million of long term debt bears interest at fixed rates ranging from to our investment securities currently include auction rate securities that are subject to failed auctions and are not currently liquid 
as of august   we had a million unrealized loss million net of taxes related to these investments 
we believe that we will be able to liquidate our auction rate securities at par at some point in the future as a result of issuer calls or refinancings  settlements with broker dealers  or upon maturity 
however  volatility in the credit markets could continue to negatively impact the timing of future liquidity related to these investments and lead to additional adjustments to their carrying value
