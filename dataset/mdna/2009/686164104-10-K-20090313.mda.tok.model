item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview background we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of pharmaceutical product candidates for the treatment of obesity 
our lead combination product candidates targeted for obesity are contrave  which is in phase iii clinical trials  and empatic  which is in the later stages of phase ii clinical development 
each of these product candidates is a combination of generic drugs  which we have systematically screened for synergistic cns activity 
each of the components of our product candidates has already received regulatory approval and has been commercialized previously 
we are testing these combinations in an effort to demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety for potential regulatory approval 
we have not yet received regulatory approval for any product candidate 
we are a development stage company 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities  primarily costs of clinical trial activities associated with our current product candidates  and general and administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the next several years as we pursue the clinical development and market launch of our product candidates and acquire or in license additional products and technologies  and add the necessary infrastructure to support our growth 
in january  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net cash proceeds from the public offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us 
in february  the underwriters exercised a portion of their overallotment option and purchased an additional  shares of our common stock  from which we received cash proceeds  net of underwriting discounts  of approximately million 
revenues we have generated approximately  in revenue from inception through december   resulting from the sublicensing of technology and amounts earned under a collaborative agreement 
during  we sublicensed technology to cypress bioscience  inc  or cypress  for an upfront payment of million  and this amount is being recognized ratably over the estimated life of the sublicensed patent 
in addition  we recognized revenue of approximately  during the year ended december  related to a collaborative agreement with eli lilly and company  or eli lilly  the term of which has since expired 
we do not expect to generate any significant revenues from licensing  achievement of milestones or product sales unless and until we are able to obtain regulatory approval of  and commercialize  our product candidates either ourselves or with a collaborator 
however  we may never generate revenues from our product candidates as we may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval or commercializing our product candidates 
research and development expenses the majority of our operating expenses to date have been incurred in research and development activities 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with clinical trials managed by our contract research organizations  or cros  product development efforts and manufacturing costs 
license fees  salaries and related employee benefits for certain personnel  and costs associated with certain non clinical activities such as regulatory expenses  are also included in this amount 
our most significant costs to date are expenses incurred in connection with the clinical trials for contrave and empatic 
the clinical trial expenses include payments to vendors such as cros  investigators  suppliers of clinical drug materials and related consultants 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred because the underlying technology associated with these expenditures relates to our research and development efforts and has no alternative future uses 
at any time  we have several ongoing research projects 
our internal research and development resources are not directly tied to any individual research project and are primarily deployed across our contrave and empatic programs  both of which target the obesity market 
we are developing our two obesity product candidates in parallel and  due to the fact that we use shared resources across projects  we do not maintain information regarding our internal costs incurred for our research and development programs on a program specific basis 
we use external service providers to manage our clinical trials  to manufacture the product supplies used in these trials and for formulations development  consulting and other activities 
prior to  our external service providers did not generally bill us on a program specific basis 
the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the year ended december  costs that are not attributable to a specific research program are included in the other category in thousands costs of external service providers obesity non obesity other subtotal internal costs stock based compensation total research and development costs at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of our product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for potential commercialization 
clinical development timelines  the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our product development programs  our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of each product candidate  as well as ongoing assessments as to each product candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates will be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
we expect our development expenses to decline in due to the completion of our contrave phase iii program 
future development expenses will depend on our financial resources as well as decisions made with respect to our empatic program 
in the second quarter of  we initiated our first two phase iii clinical trials for contrave and in the fourth quarter of  we initiated our last two phase iii clinical trials for contrave 
in july  we initiated a phase iib clinical trial for empatic 
we anticipate all of these trials to be completed in the third quarter of the lengthy process of completing our clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or delay in completing our clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause a delay in the commencement of product revenues and cause our research and development expenses to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we do not expect any of our current product candidates to be commercially available in major markets before  if at all 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting and internal support functions 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal  consulting and accounting services 
we anticipate increases in general and administrative expenses as we add personnel  comply with the reporting obligations applicable to publicly held companies  and continue to build our corporate infrastructure in support of our continued development and preparation for the potential commercialization of our product candidates 
other income expense other income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities 
interest expense consists of interest incurred in connection with the million credit and security agreement  as amended  with ge healthcare financial services 
income taxes at december   we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal and state loss carryforwards begin to expire in and  respectively  unless previously utilized 
at december   we have federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal research and development tax credits begin to expire in unless previously utilized and the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely 
under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the internal revenue code  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
an analysis was performed which indicated that multiple ownership changes have occurred in previous years which created annual limitations on our ability to utilize our net operating loss  or nol  and tax credit carryovers 
such limitations will result in approximately  of tax benefits related to nol and tax credit carryforwards that will expire unused 
accordingly  the related net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards have been removed from deferred tax assets accompanied by a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
due to the existence of the valuation allowance  limitations created by future ownership changes  if any  will not impact our effective tax rate 
beneficial conversion feature during november  we completed the sale of  shares of series c convertible preferred stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
the series c convertible preferred stock was sold at a price per share below the anticipated ipo price 
accordingly  pursuant to emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features  we recorded a deemed dividend on the series c convertible preferred stock of  which is equal to the number of shares of series c convertible preferred stock sold multiplied by the difference between the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock and the series c conversion price per share 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
research and development expenses a substantial portion of our ongoing research and development activities are performed under agreements we enter into with external service providers  including cros  which conduct many of our research and development activities 
we accrue for costs incurred under these contracts based on factors such as estimates of work performed  patient enrollment  progress of patient studies and other events 
however  the level of estimates can be significant 
to date  we have not made any material adjustments to our estimates of clinical trial expenses 
we make good faith estimates that we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risks and may change depending upon a number of factors  including our clinical development plan 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  using the prospective transition method 
sfas no 
r requires that share based payment transactions with employees be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
we calculate the fair value of stock option grants using the black scholes option pricing model 
prior to january   we applied the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
under this method  if the exercise price of the award equaled or exceeded the fair value of the underlying stock on the measurement date  no compensation expense was recognized 
the measurement date was the date on which the final number of shares and exercise price were known and was generally the grant date for awards to employees and directors 
if the exercise price of the award was below the fair value of the underlying stock on the measurement date  then compensation cost was recorded  using the intrinsic value method  and was generally recognized in the statements of operations over the vesting period of the award 
we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees  directors and non employees under our equity incentive award plan 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
at december   total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non vested stock options granted prior to that date was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we calculate the fair value of stock option grants using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  risk free interest rate and the expected term of the awards 
the weighted average expected life of options was calculated using the simplified method as prescribed by the securities exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab no 
this decision was based on the lack of relevant historical data due to our limited historical experience 
for options granted during the year ended december   we have calculated a weighted average expected term of years 
in addition  due to our limited historical data  the estimated volatility reflects the application of securities exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab no 
 incorporating the historical volatility of comparable companies whose share prices are publicly available 
for purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during using the black scholes model  we used estimated weighted average stock price volatility of the risk free interest rate assumption was based on the united states treasury s rates for us treasury zero coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued weighted average risk free interest rate of for the year ended december  
the assumed dividend yield was based on our expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
for  and  we have reduced stock based compensation expense recognized in the statement of operations to reflect estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
pre vesting forfeitures were estimated to be approximately for all years ended december   and based on historical experience 
equity instruments issued to non employees are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with sfas no 
r and eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods and services  and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and are recognized as expense over the related service period 
income taxes in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued financial interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and was adopted by us on january  the adoption of fin did not impact our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of fin will have a material effect on our effective tax rate in future periods 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for each of the years ended december  and were  and were related to our sublicensed technology to cypress 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in this increase of approximately million was due primarily to an increase in expenses in connection with our contrave phase iii clinical trials  related proprietary product formulation work and consulting activities totaling million 
the remaining increase is primarily the result of increases in salaries and personnel related costs totaling approximately million and stock based compensation costs totaling approximately  partially offset by a decrease in consulting fees of million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in this increase of million was principally due to increases in stock based compensation costs totaling approximately million  increases in salaries and personnel related costs totaling million  an increase in facilities expenses of  and an increase in costs related to consulting activities of interest and other income 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period during this decrease of  was primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by an increase in average cash and investment balances 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the comparable period in primarily due to an increase of the amounts borrowed under the credit and security agreement  as amended  with ge healthcare financial services  of which approximately million is outstanding as of december  comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  and were related to our sublicensed technology to cypress 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period during this increase of million was due primarily to increased expenses in connection with our contrave phase iii clinical trials  related proprietary product formulation work and consulting activities totaling approximately million 
the remaining increase is primarily the result of increases in salaries and personnel related costs totaling approximately million and stock based compensation costs totaling approximately million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period during this increase of million was principally due to increases in salaries and personnel related costs totaling approximately million  increases in stock based compensation costs totaling approximately million  increases in other professional fees totaling approximately  and increases in legal fees totaling approximately  interest and other income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the comparable period during this increase of million was due to the increase in average cash and investment balances as a result of our ipo in may and our series c preferred stock financing in november interest expense 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  primarily due to the amortization of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the million credit and security agreement  as amended  with ge healthcare financial services and interest expense on the million and million borrowed under the credit and security agreement in march and december  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  our operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity securities 
through december   we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of shares of our preferred and common stock as follows from september  to december   we issued and sold a total of  shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of in march  we issued and sold a total of  shares of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million and the conversion of promissory notes and interest thereon totaling million  from april to may  we issued and sold  shares of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  in november  we issued and sold a total of  shares of series c convertible preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  in may  we issued and sold a total of  shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  and in january and february  we issued and sold a total of  shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and an additional million in investment securities  available for sale 
as of december   our holdings primarily consisted of treasury backed money market funds  treasuries  and other instruments that are insured  guaranteed or supported by the us federal government and some corporate debt obligations 
in addition  we have established guidelines relating to diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million for and  respectively 
net cash used in each of these periods was primarily a result of external research and development expenses  clinical trial costs  personnel related costs  third party supplier expenses and professional fees 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for and net cash used in investing activities was million for the comparable period in these amounts are primarily the result of the net purchases and maturities of investment securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
the net cash provided for is primarily as a result of the public sale of common stock in january and february for aggregate net proceeds of million 
the net cash provided for is primarily the result of the sale of common stock in our initial public offering in may for aggregate net proceeds of million and a million draw against our credit and security agreement  as amended  with ge healthcare financial services in march we cannot be certain if  when or to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of our product candidates 
we expect our development expenses to be substantial and to increase over the next few years as we continue the advancement of our product development programs 
as a biopharmaceutical company focused on in licensing and developing proprietary pharmaceutical product candidates  we have entered into license agreements to acquire the rights to develop and commercialize contrave and empatic 
pursuant to these agreements  we obtained exclusive licenses to the patent rights and know how for selected indications and territories 
under our license agreement with duke university  we issued  shares of our common stock in march and may be required to make future milestone payments totaling up to million upon the achievement of various milestones related to regulatory or commercial events 
under our license agreement with lee dante  md  we issued an option to purchase  shares of our common stock in april at an exercise price of per share  which expires in april we also paid dr 
dante an upfront fee of  and may be required to make future milestone payments totaling up to million upon the achievement of a milestone related to a regulatory event 
under our license agreement with oregon health science university  we issued  shares of our common stock in december and paid an upfront fee of  under these three agreements  we are also obligated to pay royalties on any net sales of the licensed products 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the progress of our clinical trials  including expenses to support the trials and milestone payments that may become payable  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  including licensing and other arrangements  the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims or other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing sales or distribution capabilities  the successful commercialization of our products  and the extent to which we in license  acquire or invest in other indications  products  technologies and businesses 
in december  we entered into a credit and security agreement with merrill lynch capital providing for potential borrowing until june  of up to million 
in july  we entered into a first amendment to the credit and security agreement with merrill lynch capital 
the first amendment provided for  among other things  the extension of the period during which merrill lynch capital was obligated to make advances under the credit and security agreement to us from june  to december  in november  we entered into a second amendment to the credit and security agreement with merrill lynch capital 
the second amendment provided for  among other things  the increase of the total amount available for advances under the credit and security agreement from million to million  our obligation to request an advance of million on or before december   and the extension of the period during which merrill lynch capital is obligated to make advances to us under the credit and security agreement from december  to december  ge healthcare services acquired a portfolio of loans from merrill lynch capital in  and the credit and security agreement  as amended  was subsequently assigned to ge healthcare financial services 
under the credit and security agreement  we drew down million  million and million in march  december and december  respectively 
under the credit and security agreement  we are required to make monthly payments of principal and interest and all amounts then outstanding will become due and payable upon the earlier to occur of july  or three years from the funding of any amounts under the agreement 
interest accrues on amounts outstanding under the agreement at a base rate set forth in the agreement plus an applicable margin  which ranges from to based on the date of borrowing 
amounts outstanding under the credit and security agreement at december  bear interest at an average rate of 
the loan is collateralized by substantially all of our assets other than  subject to certain limited exceptions  intellectual property 
subject to certain limited exceptions  amounts prepaid under the credit and security agreement are subject to a prepayment fee equal to of the amount prepaid 
in addition  upon repayment of the amounts borrowed for any reason  we will be required to pay an exit fee equal to the greater of  or of the total amounts borrowed under the credit facility 
under the terms of the agreement  we are subject to operational covenants  including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt  pay dividends  redeem our stock  make specified investments and engage in merger  consolidation or asset sale transactions  among other restrictions 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through at least the next months 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources  proceeds of potential offerings of our equity securities  potential borrowings and potential corporate collaborations 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of additional equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and other debt financing 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and investment resources will be adequate  that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs  relinquish some or even all rights to product candidates or renegotiate less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial requirements that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table describes our long term contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by periods total less than year years years after long term debt obligations long term liabilities operating lease obligations license obligations total in december  we entered into a credit and security agreement with merrill lynch capital  which was subsequently assigned to ge healthcare financial services  providing for the potential borrowing of up to million 
in november  the amount available for borrowing under the credit and security agreement was increased to million 
in march  december and december  we drew down million  million and million  respectively  under the credit and security agreement 
primarily represents fees due to the lender incurred in connection with our credit and security agreement  as amended  with ge healthcare financial services due on the earlier of the repayment of total amounts borrowed or termination of the agreement 
license obligations do not include additional payments of up to million due upon the occurrence of certain milestones related to regulatory or commercial events or potential payments of up to million to duke university should we receive milestone payments from cypress under our agreement with cypress up to million excluding milestone payments unrelated to sleep apnea 
we may also be required to pay royalties on any net sales of the licensed products 
license payments may be increased based on the timing of various milestones and the extent to which the licensed technologies are pursued for other indications 
these milestone payments and royalty payments under our license agreements are not included in the table above because we cannot  at this time  determine when or if the related milestones will be achieved or the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur 
we also enter into agreements with third parties to manufacture our product candidates  conduct our clinical trials and perform data collection and analysis 
our payment obligations under these agreements depend upon the progress of our development programs 
therefore  we are unable at this time to estimate with certainty the future costs we will incur under these agreements 
recent accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurement  related to its financial assets 
we measure certain assets at fair value as disclosed in the footnotes to our quarterly and annual financial statements 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial statements 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
allows certain financial assets and liabilities to be recognized  at our election  at fair market value  with any gains or losses for the period recorded in the statement of operations 
sfas no 
includes investment securities  available for sale in the assets eligible for this treatment 
we have not elected to account for any investment securities  available for sale using the provisions of sfas no 
currently  we record any unrealized gains or losses for investment securities  available for sale for the period in comprehensive income and in the equity section of the balance sheet 
on january   we adopted eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property 
companies may enter into arrangements with other companies to jointly develop  manufacture  distribute  and market a product 
often the activities associated with these arrangements are conducted by the collaborators without the creation of a separate legal entity that is  the arrangement is operated as a virtual joint venture 
the arrangements generally provide that the collaborators will share  based on contractually defined calculations  the profits or losses from the associated activities 
periodically  the collaborators share financial information related to product revenues generated if any and costs incurred that may trigger a sharing payment for the combined profits or losses 
the consensus requires collaborators in such an arrangement to present the result of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
as our current collaborative agreement does not incorporate such a revenue and cost sharing arrangement  the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have an impact on our financial statements 
on january   we adopted the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities 
the consensus requires companies to defer and capitalize prepaid  nonrefundable research and development payments to third parties over the period that the research and development activities are performed or the services are provided  subject to an assessment of recoverability 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have an impact on our financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas no 
identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap in the united states the gaap hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  sfas no 
r and sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 sfas no 

sfas r will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
sfas no 
will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas no 
r and sfas no 
are effective for the company on january  early adoption is not permitted 
the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r and sfas no 
will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements  but will change the manner in which potential future acquisitions and direct costs of acquisitions are reported 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not engaged in any off balance sheet activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents as of december  consisted primarily of money market funds  us government agency securities and corporate debt obligations 
we do not have any auction rate securities on our balance sheet  as they are not permitted by our investment policy 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities  all with various maturities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
recently  there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed and auction rate securities and the resultant effect on various securities markets 
our cash is invested in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors which specifies the categories  allocations  and ratings of securities we may consider for investment 
we do not believe our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities have significant risk of default or illiquidity 
we made this determination based on discussions with our investment advisors and a review of our holdings 
while we believe our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities are well diversified and do not contain excessive risk  we cannot provide assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value 
in addition  continuing concerns over inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic recession and fears of a possible depression 
domestic and international equity markets continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil 
these events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us 
in the event of a continuing market downturn  our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary and our stock price may further decline 
in addition  we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents that are not federally insured 
given the current economic instability  we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these investments
