risk factors 
overview we design  manufacture and implement energy management systems consisting primarily of high performance  energy efficient lighting systems  controls and related services 
we currently generate the substantial majority of our revenue from sales of high intensity fluorescent  or hif  lighting systems and related services to commercial and industrial customers 
we typically sell our hif lighting systems in replacement of our customers existing high intensity discharge  or hid  fixtures 
we call this replacement process a retrofit 
we frequently engage our customer s existing electrical contractor to provide installation and project management services 
we also sell our hif lighting systems on a wholesale basis  principally to electrical contractors and value added resellers to sell to their own customer bases 
we have sold and installed more than  of our hif lighting systems in over  facilities from december  through march  we have sold our products to fortune companies  many of which have installed our hif lighting systems in multiple facilities 
our top direct customers by revenue in fiscal included coca cola enterprises inc  anheuser busch companies  inc  kraft foods inc  ben e 
keith co  sysco corp  americold logistics  llc and us foodservice 
our fiscal year ends on march we call our fiscal years ended march   and  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our fiscal first quarter ends on june  our fiscal second quarter ends on september  our fiscal third quarter ends on december and our fiscal fourth quarter ends on march because of the current recessed state of the global economy  especially as it relates to capital equipment manufacturers  we expect our first half of fiscal year to continue to be impacted by lengthened customer sales cycles and sluggish customer capital spending 
to address anticipated reduced profitability as a result of the expected slow first half of fiscal year  we have recently implemented million of cost reductions 
these cost reductions include headcount reductions  work hour reductions and discretionary spending reductions 
we believe these cost reduction efforts will better position us for profitability in the back half of fiscal  dependent upon the economic environment 
despite near term economic challenges  we remain optimistic about our long term financial performance 
our long term optimism is based upon the considerable size of the existing market opportunity for lighting retrofits  the continued development of our new products and product enhancements  the opportunity for our participation in the replacement part aftermarket and the increasing national recognition of the importance of environmental stewardship  including the recent allocation of stimulus funds for energy efficiency projects 
revenue and expense components revenue 
we sell our energy management products and services directly to commercial and industrial customers  and indirectly to end users through wholesale sales to electrical contractors and value added resellers 
we currently generate the substantial majority of our revenue from sales of hif lighting systems and related services to commercial and industrial customers 
while our services include comprehensive site assessment  site field verification  utility incentive and government subsidy management  engineering design  project management  installation and recycling in connection with our retrofit installations  we separately recognize service revenue only for our installation and recycling services 
except for our installation and recycling services  all other services are completed prior to product shipment and revenue from such services is included in product revenue because evidence of fair value for these services does not exist 
in fiscal  we increased our efforts in selling through our contractor and value added reseller channels with marketing through mass mailings  participating in national trade organizations and providing training to channel partners on our sales methodologies 
these wholesale channels 
table of contents accounted for approximately of our total revenue volume in fiscal which was an increase from the of total revenues contributed in fiscal we believe that this growth trend will moderate in fiscal and our wholesale mix of total revenues will be comparable to our fiscal mix 
in october  we introduced to the market a new financing program for our customer s purchase of our energy management systems called the orion virtual power plant ovpp 
the ovpp is structured as a supply contract in which we commit to deliver a defined amount of energy savings at a fixed rate over the life of the contract  typically months 
we collect payments from our customers on a monthly basis across the delivery period 
this program creates a revenue stream  but may lessen near term revenues as the payments are recognized as revenue on a monthly basis over the life of the contract versus upfront upon product shipment or project completion 
however  we do retain the option to sell the payment stream to a third party finance company  as we have done under the terms of our former financing program  in which case the revenue would be recognized at the net present value of the total future payments from the finance company upon completion of the project 
the ovpp program was established to assist customers who are interested in purchasing our energy management systems but who have capital expenditure budget limitations 
for fiscal  we recognized  of revenue from completed ovpp contracts 
as of march   customers have signed ovpp supply agreements for expected gross revenue streams of million 
in the future  we expect an increase in the volume of contracts that utilize the ovpp financing program 
our gross margins on ovpp revenues are similar to gross margins achieved on cash sales 
we recognize revenue on product only sales at the time of shipment 
for projects consisting of multiple elements of revenue  such as a combination of product sales and services  we separate the project into separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values for revenue recognition purposes 
additionally  the deferral of revenue on a delivered element may be required if such revenue is contingent upon the delivery of the remaining undelivered elements 
we recognize revenue at the time of product shipment on product sales and on services completed prior to product shipment 
we recognize revenue associated with services provided after product shipment  based on their fair value  when the services are completed and customer acceptance has been received 
when other significant obligations or acceptance terms remain after products are delivered  revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled or acceptance by the customer has occurred 
our dependence on individual key customers can vary from period to period as a result of the significant size of some of our retrofit and multi facility roll out projects 
our top customers accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
one customer accounted for approximately of our total revenue for fiscal while no customers accounted for more than of revenue in fiscal if large retrofit and roll out projects become a greater component of our total revenue  we may experience more customer concentration in given periods 
the loss of  or substantial reduction in sales volume to  any of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our total revenue in any given period and may result in significant annual and quarterly revenue variations 
our level of total revenue for any given period is dependent upon a number of factors  including i the demand for our products and systems  including our ovpp program  ii the number and timing of large retrofit and multi facility retrofit  or roll out  projects  iii the level of our wholesale sales  iv our ability to realize revenue from our services and our ovpp program  including whether we decide to retain or resell the expected future cash flows under our ovpp program and the relative timing of the resultant revenue recognition  v market conditions  vi our execution of our sales process  vii our ability to compete in a highly competitive market and our ability to respond successfully to market competition  viii the selling price of our products and services  ix changes in capital investment levels by our customers and prospects  and x customer sales cycles 
as a result  our total revenue may be subject to quarterly variations and our total revenue for any particular fiscal quarter may not be indicative of future results 
backlog 
we define backlog as the total contractual value of all firm orders received for our lighting products and services 
such orders must be evidenced by a signed proposal acceptance or purchase order from the customer 
our backlog does not include ovpp contracts or national contracts that have been negotiated  but we have not yet received a purchase order for the specific location 
as of march   we had a backlog of firm purchase orders of approximately million 
as of march   we had a backlog of firm purchase orders of approximately million 
we generally expect this level of firm purchase order backlog to be converted into revenue within the 
table of contents following quarter 
principally  as a result of the continued lengthening of our customer s purchasing decisions because of current recessed economic conditions and related factors  the continued shortening of our installation cycles and the number of projects sold through national and ovpp contracts  a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of actual revenue recognized in future periods 
cost of revenue 
our total cost of revenue consists of costs for i raw materials  including sheet  coiled and specialty reflective aluminum  ii electrical components  including ballasts  power supplies and lamps  iii wages and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges  for our fabricating  coating  assembly  logistics and project installation service organizations  iv manufacturing facilities  including depreciation on our manufacturing facilities and equipment  taxes  insurance and utilities  v warranty expenses  vi installation and integration  and vii shipping and handling 
our cost of aluminum can be subject to commodity price fluctuations  which we attempt to mitigate with forward fixed price  minimum quantity purchase commitments with our suppliers 
we also purchase many of our electrical components through forward purchase contracts 
we buy most of our specialty reflective aluminum from a single supplier  and most of our ballast and lamp components from a single supplier  although we believe we could obtain sufficient quantities of these raw materials and components on a price and quality competitive basis from other suppliers if necessary 
purchases from our current primary supplier of ballast and lamp components constituted and of our total cost of revenue for fiscal and fiscal our production labor force is non union and  as a result  our production labor costs have been relatively stable 
we have been expanding our network of qualified third party installers to realize efficiencies in the installation process 
toward the end of fiscal  we began to vertically integrate some of our processes performed at outside suppliers to help us better manage delivery lead time  control process quality and inventory supply 
we installed a coating line and acquired production fabrication equipment 
each of these production items provides us with additional capacity to continue to support our potential future revenue growth 
we expect that these processes will help to reduce overall unit costs as the equipment becomes more fully utilized 
gross margin 
our gross profit has been and will continue to be  affected by the relative levels of our total revenue and our total cost of revenue  and as a result  our gross profit may be subject to quarterly variation 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue  or gross margin  is affected by a number of factors  including i our mix of large retrofit and multi facility roll out projects with national accounts  ii the level of our wholesale sales  iii our realization rate on our billable services  iv our project pricing  v our level of warranty claims  vi our level of utilization of our manufacturing facilities and production equipment and related absorption of our manufacturing overhead costs  vii our level of efficiencies in our manufacturing operations  and viii our level of efficiencies from our subcontracted installation service providers 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses consist of i general and administrative expenses  ii sales and marketing expenses  and iii research and development expenses 
personnel related costs are our largest operating expense 
while we have recently focused on reducing our personnel costs and headcount in certain functional areas  we do nonetheless believe that future opportunities within our business remain strong 
as a result  we may choose to selectively add to our sales staff based upon opportunities in regional markets 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs for i salaries and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges  related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and operations organizations  ii public company costs  including investor relations and audit  iii occupancy expenses  iv professional services fees  v technology related costs and amortization  and vi corporate related travel 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs for i salaries and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges  related to our sales and marketing organization  ii internal and external sales commissions and bonuses  iii travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses associated with our selling efforts  iv marketing programs  v pre sales costs  and vi other related overhead 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs for i salaries and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges  related to our engineering organization  ii payments to consultants  iii the design and development of new energy management products and enhancements to our existing energy management system  iv quality assurance and testing  and v other related overhead 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 

table of contents we have been incurring increased general and administrative expenses in connection with our becoming a public company  including increased accounting  audit  investor relations  legal and support services and sarbanes oxley compliance fees and expenses 
additionally  we anticipate our operating expenses to increase in fiscal as a result of the completion of our new technology center and the related building occupancy costs 
we expense all pre sale costs incurred in connection with our sales process prior to obtaining a purchase order 
these pre sale costs may reduce our net income in a given period prior to recognizing any corresponding revenue 
we also intend to continue to invest in our research and development of new and enhanced energy management products and services 
we recognize compensation expense for the fair value of our stock option awards granted over their related vesting period using the modified prospective method of adoption under the provisions of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment 
prior to fiscal  we accounted for our stock option awards under the intrinsic value method under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and we did not recognize the fair value expense of our stock option awards in our statements of operations  although we did report our pro forma stock option award fair value expense in the footnotes to our financial statements 
we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal as a result of prior option grants  including option grants in fiscal  we expect to recognize an additional million of stock based compensation over a weighted average period of approximately six years 
these charges have been  and will continue to be  allocated to cost of product revenue  general and administrative expenses  sales and marketing expenses and research and development expenses based on the departments in which the personnel receiving such awards have primary responsibility 
a substantial majority of these charges have been  and likely will continue to be  allocated to general and administrative expenses and sales and marketing expenses 
interest expense 
our interest expense is comprised primarily of interest expense on outstanding borrowings under long term debt obligations described under liquidity and capital resources indebtedness below  including the amortization of previously incurred financing costs 
we amortize deferred financing costs to interest expense over the life of the related debt instrument  ranging from six to fifteen years 
dividend and interest income 
our dividend income consists of dividends paid on preferred shares that we acquired in july the terms of these preferred shares provided for annual dividend payments to us of million 
the preferred shares were sold back to the issuer in june and all dividends accrued were paid upon sale 
we also report interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
for fiscal  our interest income increased as a result of our investment of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in short term  interest bearing  money market funds  bank certificate of deposits and investment grade securities 
income taxes 
as of march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes and million for state tax purposes 
included in these loss carryforwards were million for federal and million for state tax purposes of compensation expenses that were associated with the exercise of nonqualified stock options 
the benefit from our net operating losses created from these compensation expenses has not yet been recognized in our financial statements and will be accounted for in our shareholders equity as a credit to additional paid in capital as the deduction reduces our income taxes payable 
we also had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately  of which  are amounts that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements  and state tax credit carryforwards of  which is net of the valuation allowance of  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of most of these assets and has reserved for an allowance due to our state apportioned income and the potential expiration of the state tax credits due to the carryforwards period 
these federal and state net operating losses and credit carryforwards are available  subject to the discussion in the following paragraph  to offset future taxable income and  if not utilized  will begin to expire in varying amounts between and generally  a change of more than in the ownership of a company s stock  by value  over a three year period constitutes an ownership change for federal income tax purposes 
an ownership change may limit a company s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change 
in fiscal and prior to our ipo  past issuances and transfers of stock caused an ownership change for certain tax purposes 
when certain ownership changes occur  tax laws require that a calculation be made to establish a limitation on the use of 
table of contents net operating loss carryforwards created in periods prior to such ownership change 
for fiscal year  utilization of our federal loss carryforwards was limited to million 
there was no limitation that occurred for fiscal accretion of preferred stock and preferred stock dividends 
our accretion of redeemable preferred stock and preferred stock dividends consisted of accumulated unpaid dividends on our series a and series c preferred stock during the periods that such shares were outstanding 
the terms of our series c preferred stock provided for a per annum cumulative dividend unless we completed a qualified initial public offering or sale 
as a result  the carrying amount of our series c preferred stock were increased each period to reflect the accretion of accumulated unpaid dividends 
the obligation to pay these accumulated unpaid dividends was extinguished upon conversion of the series c preferred stock because our ipo constituted a qualified initial public offering under the terms of our series c preferred stock 
the series c preferred stock automatically converted into common stock upon closing of our ipo  and the carrying amount of our series c preferred stock  along with accumulated unpaid dividends  was credited to additional paid in capital at that time 
our series a preferred stock was issued beginning in fiscal and provided for a per annum cumulative dividend 
our series a preferred stock was converted into shares of our common stock in fiscal and fiscal as described under conversion of preferred stock 
conversion of preferred stock 
in fiscal  we offered our holders of then outstanding series a preferred stock the opportunity to convert each of their series a preferred shares  together with the accumulated unpaid dividends thereon and their other rights and preferences related thereto  into three shares of our common stock 
since the series a preferred shareholders had the existing right to convert each of their series a preferred shares into two shares of common stock  we determined that the increase in the conversion ratio from two to three shares of common stock was an inducement offer 
as a result  we accounted for the value of the change in this conversion ratio as an increase to additional paid in capital and a charge to our accumulated deficit at the time of conversion 
in fiscal   outstanding series a preferred shares were converted into shares of our common stock 
the remaining  outstanding series a preferred shares were converted into shares of our common stock on march  the premium amount recorded for the inducement  calculated using the number of additional common shares offered multiplied by the estimated fair market value of our common stock at the time of conversion  was million for fiscal and  for fiscal participation rights of preferred stock in undistributed earnings 
because all series of our preferred stock participate in all undistributed earnings with the common stock  we allocated earnings to the common shareholders and participating preferred shareholders under the two class method as required by emerging issues task force issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
the two class method is an earnings allocation method under which basic net income per share is calculated for our common stock and participating preferred stock considering both accrued preferred stock dividends and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the year 
because our participating preferred stock was not contractually required to share in our losses  in applying the two class method to compute basic net income per common share  we did not make any allocation to our preferred stock if a net loss existed or if an undistributed net loss resulted from reducing net income by the accrued preferred stock dividends 
all of our preferred stock was converted automatically into common stock on a one for one basis upon the closing of our ipo and we are no longer required to allocate any undistributed earnings to our preferred shareholders

table of contents our total revenue can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the purchasing decisions of our customers and our overall level of sales activity 
historically  our customers have tended to increase their purchases near the beginning or end of their capital budget cycles  which tend to correspond to the beginning or end of the calendar year 
as a result  we have in the past experienced lower relative total revenue in our fiscal first and second quarters and higher relative total revenue in our fiscal third and fourth quarters 
these seasonal fluctuations have been largely offset by our customers decisions to initiate multiple facility roll outs 
we expect that there may be future variations in our quarterly total revenue depending on our level of national account roll out projects and wholesale sales 
our results for any particular fiscal quarter may not be indicative of results for other fiscal quarters or an entire fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources overview on december   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share which includes the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option to purchase  shares and the sale of  shares by certain of our shareholders 
net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately million net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before the deduction of offering expenses 
we invested the net proceeds from the ipo in money market funds 
we currently plan to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes  including to fund potential future acquisitions 
as of the date of this form k  we have not entered into any purchase agreements  understandings or commitments with respect to any acquisitions 
we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of march  compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of march  our cash equivalents are invested in money market accounts  bank certificates of deposit  corporate securities and government agency bonds with maturities of less than days and an average yield of 
our short term investment account consists of a bank certificate of deposit in the amount of million with an expiration date of september and a yield of and a single government agency bond with an expiration date of november and a current yield of 
the current recessionary state of the global economy could potentially have negative effects on our near term liquidity and capital resources  including slower collections of receivables  delays of existing order deliveries and postponements of incoming orders 
however  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  our anticipated cash flows from operating activities and our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the remainder of fiscal as of march   we were in a strong financial position with million in cash and short term investments 
for that reason  we do not anticipate drawing on our million line of credit nor do we expect to use significant amounts of our cash balances for operating activities during fiscal our future working capital requirements thereafter will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue  our introduction of new products and services and enhancements to our existing energy management system  the timing and extent of expansions of our sales force and other administrative and production personnel  the timing and extent of advertising and promotional campaigns  and our research and development activities 
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for our fiscal  fiscal and fiscal fiscal year ended march  in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents

our working capital changes in fiscal were due to a decrease of million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments due to cash used to repurchase common stock of million and capital expenditures of million  a decrease of million in accounts receivable due to improved collections and a reduction in fourth quarter fiscal revenues and a million decrease in accrued expenses resulting from reductions in accrued income taxes  bonus compensation expense and accrued service costs as a result of decreasing installation service revenue  offset by a million increase in inventories due to investments in our phase wireless initiatives 
the vast majority of these wireless components are manufactured overseas and require longer delivery times 
we attempt to maintain a sufficient supply of on hand inventory of purchased components and raw materials to meet anticipated demand  as well as to reduce our risk of unexpected raw material or component shortages or supply interruptions 
our accounts receivable  inventory and payables may increase to the extent our revenue and order levels increase 
indebtedness on march   we entered into a credit agreement credit agreement to replace a previous agreement between us and wells fargo bank  na 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility line of 
table of contents credit that matures on august  the initial maximum aggregate amount of availability under the line of credit is million 
we have a one time option to increase the maximum aggregate amount of availability under the line of credit to up to million  although any advance from the line of credit over million is discretionary to wells fargo even if no event of default has occurred 
borrowings are limited to a percentage of eligible trade accounts receivables and inventories  less any borrowing base reserve that may be established from time to time 
in may  we completed an amendment to the credit agreement  effective as of march   which formalized wells fargo s prior consent to our treasury repurchase program  increased the capital expenditures covenant for fiscal and revised certain financial covenants by adding a minimum requirement for unencumbered liquid assets  increasing the quarterly rolling net income requirement and modifying the merger and acquisition covenant exemption 
borrowings allowed under the line of credit as of march  were million based upon available working capital as defined 
in december  we briefly drew million on the line due to the timing of treasury repurchases and funds available in our operating account 
the borrowings were repaid within a few days 
as of march  there were no borrowings on the line of credit 
as of march   we were in compliance with all covenants  as amended 
we pay a fee of on the average daily unused amount of the line of credit and fees upon the issuance of each letter of credit equal to per annum of the principal amount thereof 
the credit agreement provides that we have the option to select the interest rate applicable to all or a portion of the outstanding principal balance of the note either i at a fluctuating rate per annum one percent below the prime rate in effect from time to time  or ii at a fixed rate per annum determined by wells fargo to be one and one quarter percent above libor 
interest is payable on the last day of each month  commencing march  the credit agreement is secured by a first lien security interest in all of our accounts receivable  general intangibles and inventory  and a second lien priority in all of our equipment and fixtures and contains certain financial covenants including minimum net income requirements and requirements that we maintain liquid assets and net worth and fixed charge coverage ratios at prescribed levels 
the credit agreement also contains certain restrictions on our ability to make capital or lease expenditures over prescribed limits  incur additional indebtedness  consolidate or merge  guarantee obligations of third parties  makes loans or advances  declare or pay any dividend or distribution on its stock  redeem or repurchase shares of its stock  or pledge assets 
based upon our recent first quarter fiscal guidance predicting a net loss for the quarter  it is likely that we will be in default under our rolling net income requirement within the terms of our credit agreement 
while we believe that our relationship with our bank remains strong  we cannot predict the impact of our anticipated covenant violation 
while we believe the likely impact will be a renegotiation of borrowing terms  our bank could elect to terminate our existing line of credit 
we have no outstanding balances on our line of credit and believe that  based upon our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  a termination of the line of credit would have no negative near term impact on our financial condition 
in addition to our line of credit  we also have other existing long term indebtedness and obligations under various debt instruments and capital lease obligations  including pursuant to a bank term note  a bank first mortgage  a debenture to a community development organization  a federal block grant loan  two city industrial revolving loans and various capital leases and equipment purchase notes 
as of march   the total amount of principal outstanding on these various obligations was million 
these obligations have varying maturity dates between and and bear interest at annual rates of between and 
the weighted average annual interest rate of such obligations as of march  was 
based on interest rates in effect as of march   we expect that our total debt service payments on such obligations for fiscal  including scheduled principal  lease and interest payments  but excluding any repayment of borrowings on our line of credit  will approximate million 
all of these obligations are subject to security interests on our assets 
several of these obligations have covenants  such as customary financial and restrictive covenants  including maintenance of a minimum debt service coverage ratio  a minimum current ratio  quarterly rolling net income requirement  limitations on executive compensation and advances  limits on capital expenditures per year  limits on distributions  and restrictions on our ability to make loans  advances  extensions of credit  investments  capital contributions  incur additional 
table of contents indebtedness  create liens  guaranty obligations  merge or consolidate or undergo a change in control 
as of march   we were in compliance with all such covenants  as amended 
capital spending we have made capital expenditures primarily for general corporate purposes for our corporate headquarters and technology center  production equipment and tooling and for information technology systems 
our capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we plan to incur approximately million in capital expenditures in fiscal to complete the construction of our corporate technology center  to complete the improvement of our erp system and for other general corporate matters 
we expect a significant amount of these capital expenditures to be spent in the first half of fiscal we expect to finance these capital expenditures primarily through our existing cash  equipment secured loans and leases  to the extent needed  or by using our available capacity under our revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations information regarding our known contractual obligations of the types described below as of march  is set forth in the following table payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands bank debt obligations capital lease obligations cash interest payments on debt and capital leases operating lease obligations purchase order and cap ex commitments total reflects non cancellable purchase commitments in the amount of million for certain inventory items entered into in order to secure better pricing and ensure materials on hand and capital expenditure commitments in the amount of million for the completion of the new technology center at our manitowoc facility and improvements to information technology systems 
the table of contractual obligations and commitments does not include our unrecognized tax benefits related to fin no 
which were million at march  we have a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of any adjustments to these unrecognized benefits 
furthermore  we believe that any negative impact from future tax audits would result in a minimal cash liability due to our net operating loss carryforwards 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we re evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  the collectability of receivables  stock based compensation  warranty reserves and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
a summary of our critical accounting policies is set forth below 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable and no further obligation exists  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the majority of our revenue is recognized when products are shipped to a customer or when services are completed and acceptance provisions  if any  have been met 
in certain of our contracts  we provide multiple deliverables 
we record the revenue associated with each element of these arrangements based on its fair value  which is generally the price charged for the element when sold on a standalone basis 
since we contract with vendors for installation services to our customers  which includes recycling of old fixtures  we determine the fair value of our installation services based on negotiated pricing with such vendors 
additionally  we offer a sales type financing program under which we finance the customer s purchase 
our contracts under this sales type financing program are typically one year in duration and  at the completion of the initial one year term  provide for i four automatic one year renewals at agreed upon pricing  ii an early buyout for cash  or iii the return of the equipment at the customer s expense 
the monthly revenue that we are entitled to receive from the sale of our lighting fixtures under our sales type financing program is fixed and is based on the cost of the lighting fixtures and applicable profit margin 
our revenue from agreements entered into under this program is not dependent upon our customers actual energy savings 
upon completion of the installation  we may choose to sell the future cash flows and residual rights to the equipment on a non recourse basis to an unrelated third party finance company in exchange for cash and future payments 
in the event that we do sell the future revenue streams  we recognize revenue based on the net present value of the future payments from the third party finance company upon completion of the project 
revenue recognized from our sales type financing program has not been material to our recent results of operations 
deferred revenue or deferred costs are recorded for project sales consisting of multiple elements  where the criteria for revenue recognition have not been met 
the majority of our deferred revenue relates to prepaid services to be provided at determined future dates 
as of march  and  our deferred revenue was million and million  respectively 
in the event that a customer project contains multiple elements that are not sold on a standalone basis  we defer all related revenue and costs until the project is complete 
deferred costs on product are recorded as a current asset as project completions occur within a few months 
as of march  and  our deferred costs were million and million  respectively 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and include raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
items are removed from inventory using the first in  first out method 
work in process inventories are comprised of raw materials that have been converted into components for final assembly 
inventory amounts include the cost to manufacture the item  such as the cost of raw materials and related freight  labor and other applied overhead costs 
we review our inventory for obsolescence and marketability 
if the estimated market value  which is based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  falls below cost  then the inventory value is reduced to its market value 
our inventory obsolescence reserves at march  and were million and million 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and continuously monitor collections and payments and estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the aging of the underlying receivables  our historical experience with write offs and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations  and we believe appropriate reserves have been established  we may not adequately predict future credit losses 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and result in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required which would result in additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at march  and march  investments 
we account for investments in accordance with sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to our financial assets and liabilities only 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us gaap and enhances disclosures about fair value 
table of contents measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas no 
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas no 
must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
as of march   our financial assets  which consisted of short term investments  were measured at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
employing level inputs 
stock based compensation 
we have historically issued stock options to our employees  executive officers and directors 
prior to april   we accounted for these option grants under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and applied the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement no 
this accounting treatment resulted in a pro forma stock option expense that was reported in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for those years 
effective april   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires us to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized for fiscal included the current period s cost for all stock options granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  april  this cost was based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas the cost for all stock options granted subsequent to march  represented the grant date fair value that was estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
compensation cost for options granted after march  has been and will be recognized in earnings  net of estimated forfeitures  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
both prior to and following our april  adoption of sfas r  the fair value of each option for financial reporting purposes was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants fiscal year ended march  expected term years years years risk free interest rate estimated volatility estimated forfeiture rate expected dividend yield the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  including fair value  expected term  risk free interest rate  expected volatility  expected dividends  and expected forfeiture rate to calculate the fair value of stock based payment awards 

table of contents we estimated the expected term of our stock options based on the vesting term of our options and expected exercise behavior 
our risk free interest rate was based on the implied yield available on united states treasury zero coupon issues as of the option grant date with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the option 
for fiscal and  we determined volatility based on an analysis of a peer group of public companies 
we intend to continue to consistently use the same methodology and group of publicly traded peer companies as we used in fiscal to determine volatility in the future until sufficient information regarding the volatility of our share price becomes available or the selected companies are no longer suitable for this purpose 
we have not paid dividends in the past and we do not expect to declare dividends in the future  resulting in a dividend yield of 
our estimated pre vesting forfeiture rate was based on our historical experience and the composition of our option plan participants  among other factors  and reduces our compensation expense recognized 
if our actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  adjustments to our compensation expense may be required in future periods 
we engaged wipfli llp  an independent third party valuation firm  or appraisal consultant  to perform a valuation analysis of the fair value of our common stock as of april  our appraisal consultant s analysis was prepared in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the aicpa practice aid 
our appraisal consultant considered a variety of valuation methodologies and economic outcomes and calculated its final valuation using the probability weighted expected return method 
specifically  the valuation again placed particular emphasis on the publicly traded guideline company method and the discounted cash flow method  as well as referencing pending company stock transactions 
the valuation results from utilizing these private company enterprise methods were then supplemented by the appraisal consultant assessing additional scenarios to reflect the increased possibility of our pursuing a potential initial public offering or similar transaction 
the analysis took into account that  in april  we had signed an arm s length negotiated letter of intent to issue a new series of preferred stock to institutional investors on terms similar to our series c preferred stock  contemplating gross proceeds of approximately million at a per share price of 
the appraisal consultant s analysis stated that the proposed per share price of the new series of preferred stock reflected liquidation preferences and dividend rights not otherwise available to our shareholders of common stock 
the analysis also noted that transactions involving the sale of our common stock among shareholders within the prior six months had occurred at prices between and per share 
the analysis took into account that we had experienced liquidity and profitability difficulties in fiscal and  but that we had recovered in fiscal and that  based on our financial condition and growth potential  our outlook from a financial perspective had improved from neutral to positive 
based on the foregoing criteria  the appraisal consultant concluded that a private company enterprise fair value for our common stock as of april  in their opinion was per share 
in accordance with the aicpa practice aid  and unlike the november valuation  which only considered private company enterprise valuation approaches  the valuation then gave further supplementary recognition and quantification to our increasingly likely consideration of a potential initial public offering  while also considering the economic value of other potential strategic alternatives or economic outcomes that might occur 
in this regard  the appraisal consultant analyzed various preliminary valuation data received in may by our board of directors in connection with our potential initial public offering 
the appraisal consultant assessed our probability of an initial public offering at  our probability of completing a strategic alternative at  and our probability of our remaining a private company at 
based on such relative probabilities and i preliminary indications of the potential increase in value of our common stock resulting from a potential initial public offering  ii the potential increase in value of our common stock from other potential strategic alternatives  iii the value of our common stock resulting from remaining a privately held company  and iv the per share value implied by the arm s length negotiated letter of intent related to our proposed new series of preferred stock  appraisal consultant concluded that the fair value of our common stock as of april  was per share 
upon release of the april  appraisal consultant valuation on june   we determined that it was appropriate to reassess the fair market value of our stock options granted in march and april and use the per share fair market value as set forth in the appraisal consultant s april  valuation solely for financial statement reporting purposes for such stock option grants 
due to the proximity of the appraisal consultant s 
table of contents november  independent valuation to our december option grants  we believe that the per share exercise price established by our compensation committee and board of directors for such stock option grants appropriately represented fair market value on the date of grant for financial reporting purposes 
based on this reassessment for financial statement reporting purposes  we will recognize additional stock based compensation expense of million over the three year weighted average term of such stock options  including million in fiscal on july   we granted stock options for  shares at an exercise price of per share 
our compensation committee and board of directors determined that the exercise price of such stock options was at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock as of such date primarily based on the per share conversion price of our substantially simultaneous subordinated convertible note placement 
our compensation committee and board of directors based this determination on the fact that the valuation of our common stock reflected in such conversion price was the result of significant arm s length negotiations with sophisticated institutional investors  led by an indirect affiliate of geefs  and took into account the possibility of our potential near term initial public offering 
in determining that such exercise price was at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on such date  our compensation committee and board of directors also took into account appraisal consultant s april  valuation of our common stock at per share  which also took into account our appraisal consultant s assessed possibility of our potential initial public offering and the potential resulting value of our common stock 
our compensation committee and board of directors determined that there were no other significant events that had occurred during this period that would have given rise to a change in the fair market value of our common stock and that  despite the increasing possibility of a near term initial public offering  such potential offering remained contingent upon many variable factors  including i our financial results  ii investor interest in our company  iii economic and stock market conditions generally and specifically as they may impact us  participants in our industry or comparable companies  iv changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts following participants in our industry or comparable companies  v earnings and other announcements by  and changes in market evaluations of  us  participants in our industry or comparable companies  vi changes in business or regulatory conditions affecting us  participants in our industry or comparable companies  and vii announcements or implementation by our competitors or us of acquisitions  technological innovations or new products 
our initial public offering price of represented a significant increase in the value of our common stock from the fair value of our common stock as assessed by our compensation committee and board of directors as of july  one of the principal reasons for the increase in value of our common stock implied by our initial public offering price is attributable to the august investment in our company by geefs  as supported by the significant increase in value realized by a european publicly traded alternative energy company which received a similar type of investment by geefs in early this increase is also in significant part attributable to our improved results of operations for our fiscal and our expectations for future growth 
during our fiscal  we realized further customer acceptance of our comprehensive energy management systems  as well as an increased volume of large customer roll out initiatives 
another important reason for this increase is related to the increase in valuation multiples of comparable public companies during this period  particularly due to i the impact of the initial public offering by another company in the energy management sector  which was completed in may  and its subsequent stock price performance  ii the impact of two recently announced follow on public offerings by companies in the energy management sector  iii the overall increased market values of publicly traded comparable companies in the energy management and alternative energy sectors  iv the increased market values of certain other publicly traded comparable companies in the energy management sector resulting from several announced acquisitions of privately held energy management companies  and the implied valuations attributable to such acquired companies  and v the valuation implied by the june announced acquisition of a publicly traded comparable company in the lighting systems and equipment sector 
our initial public offering price also reflected the increased value of our common stock associated with it becoming a publicly traded security  compared to the relative lack of marketability of our common stock prior to this offering 
as required by our stock and incentive awards plan  since the closing of our initial public offering in december  we have solely used the closing sale price of our common shares on the nasdaq global market on the date of grant to establish the exercise price of our stock options 

table of contents we recognized stock based compensation expense under sfas r of million for fiscal and million for fiscal as of march   million of total stock option compensation cost was expected to be recognized by us over a weighted average period of years 
we expect to recognize million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal based on our stock options outstanding as of march  this expense will increase further to the extent we have granted  or will grant  additional stock options in fiscal common stock warrants 
we issued common stock warrants to placement agents in connection with our various stock offerings and services rendered in fiscal and the value of warrants recorded as offering costs was  and  in fiscal and fiscal the value of warrants recorded for services was  in fiscal as of march   warrants were outstanding to purchase a total of  shares  respectively  of our common stock at weighted average exercise prices of per share 
these warrants were valued using a black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions i contractual terms of five years  ii weighted average risk free interest rates of to  iii expected volatility ranging between and  and iv dividend yields of 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expenses  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in our statements of operations 
our judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
for fiscal  we have determined that a valuation allowance against our net state deferred tax assets was necessary in the amount of  due to our state apportioned income and the potential expiration of state tax credits due to the carryforward periods 
in making this determination  we considered all available positive and negative evidence  including projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  recent financial performance and ownership changes 
we believe that past issuances and transfers of our stock caused an ownership change in fiscal that affected the timing of the use of our net operating loss carryforwards  but we do not believe the ownership change affects the use of the full amount of the net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such ownership change to offset taxable income will be subject to limitations in a particular year  which could potentially result in increased future tax liability for us 
as of march   our federal net operating loss carryforwards were million and our state net operating loss carryforwards were million 
included in the loss carryforwards are million of federal and million of state expenses that are associated with the exercise of non qualified stock options that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements 
the benefit from the net operating losses created from these expenses will be recorded as a reduction in taxes payable and an increase in additional paid in capital when the benefits are realized 
we first recognize tax benefits from current period stock option expenses against current period income 
the remaining current period income is offset by net operating losses under the tax law ordering approach 
under this approach  we will utilize the net operating losses from stock option expenses last 
as of march   we had federal tax credit carryforwards of million  of which million are amounts that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements  and state tax credit carryforwards of million  which is net of a  valuation allowance 
we recognize penalties and interest related to uncertain tax liabilities in income tax expense 
penalties and interest were immaterial as of the date of adoption and are included in unrecognized tax benefits 
due to the existence of net operating loss and credit carryforwards  all years since are open to examination by tax authorities 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which became effective for us on april  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for 
table of contents the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the adoption of fin resulted in an increase to our accumulated deficit of million at march  recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp fas  which amends the list of factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under fas no

the new guidance applies to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets and intangible assets acquired in both business combinations and asset acquisitions 
under fsp fas  entities estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements or  in the absence of historical experience  must consider assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension 
fsp fas will require certain additional disclosures beginning october  and prospective application to useful life estimates prospectively for intangible assets acquired after september  we are in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of fsp fas may have on our financial statements and related disclosures

fsp fas and apb amend sfas no

this fsp also amends abp to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods 
we are required to adopt fsp fas and apb in our first quarter ending june  we do not expect that the adoption of fsp fas and apb will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
fsp fas and fas amends the other than temporary impairment guidance for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements 
we are required to adopt fsp fas and fas in our first quarter ending june  we do not expect that the adoption of fsp fas and fas will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

inflation 
our results from operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by inflation 
foreign exchange risk 
we face minimal exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our foreign currency losses for all reporting periods have been nominal 
interest rate risk 
our investments consist primarily of investments in money market funds  certificate of deposits and government sponsored instruments 
while the instruments we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we do not believe that we are subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
it is our policy not to enter into interest rate derivative financial instruments 
as a result  we do not currently have any significant interest rate exposure 
as of march   million of our million of outstanding debt was at floating interest rates 
an increase of in the prime rate would result in an increase in our interest expense of approximately  per year 
commodity price risk 
we are exposed to certain commodity price risks associated with our purchases of raw materials  most significantly our aluminum purchases 
we attempt to mitigate commodity price fluctuation for our aluminum through to month forward fixed price purchase orders and minimum quantity purchase commitments with suppliers
