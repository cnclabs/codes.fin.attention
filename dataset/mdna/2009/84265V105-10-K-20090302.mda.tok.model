table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation executive summary this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to and should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  therefore  unless otherwise noted  the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for us  including our minera mexico subsidiary  on a consolidated basis for all periods 
our financial results may not be indicative of our future results 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors 
see cautionary statements 
overview our business is primarily the production and sale of copper 
in the process of producing copper  a number of valuable metallurgical by products are recovered  such as molybdenum  zinc  silver  lead and gold  which we also produce and sell 
market forces outside of our control largely determine the sales prices for our products 
our management  therefore  focuses on copper production  cost control  production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to remain profitable 
we believe we endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs  exploration efforts and cost reduction programs 
our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices 
since our inception  we have principally maintained operations in peru 
however  in recent years  we have refocused our strategies to internationalize our business and broaden our market exposure 
in  we acquired exploration properties in chile  which are being evaluated for potential exploitation and  in we acquired minera mexico  with substantial mining operations in mexico 
the acquisition was accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests as it involved the reorganization of entities under common control 
the year was a turbulent time for the world s economies and it appears to us that this will continue at a minimum through the sub prime mortgage crisis in the united states led to liquidity issues at the major financial institutions and this spread through most of the industrialized world 
these problems began to have a significant effect on our industry in the third quarter of and continued through the balance of the year as metal prices declined 
the lme copper price ended at per pound and averaged per pound for the first three quarters of  the copper price in the fourth quarter  however  averaged per pound and ended the year at per pound 
early in  through mid february we see copper averaging about per pound 
these metal prices are being influenced by current economic distress and also by inventory adjustments draw downs by the worlds copper consumers 
we anticipate that the inventory adjustments will be completed later in and that demand will rise afterwards 
however  it is difficult to predict with any accuracy when this will occur 

table of contents while we are experiencing a major downturn  it must be remembered that we are in a cyclical industry and have historically operated through these up and down periods 
our company s strengths lie in our ore reserves  our low operating costs  our strong cash position of million and our low debt level of billion  with no significant principal payments until  which we believe will permit us to maintain our profitability and positive cash flow 
nevertheless  we have suspended most of our capital investments in new as well as in expansion projects  as we believe this prudence and business discipline is needed during the current low commodity cycle 
by most objective results was a good year for our company 
sales of billion and net earnings of billion were the third highest in our history  and dividend distributions to our shareholders of billion were the second highest in our history 
additionally  the average lme price of copper of per pound and the average molybdenum price of were the second and third highest average prices  respectively  for these metals 
however  the year closed with declining metal prices and resulted in a fourth quarter loss of million  the first such loss of our company since we combined our peruvian operations with minera mexico in the declining fourth quarter metal prices also created an adjustment to sales to write down provisionally priced sales to the lower realized prices and lower future prices 
this occurred as much of our copper  and almost all of our molybdenum sales  take their final price in months subsequent to shipment 
sales value for these provisionally priced shipments are recorded at prices in effect at the time of shipment  so that in a time of decreasing metal prices prior months sales create a negative adjustment to sales 
the effect in of the provisional price adjustment was a reduction in net sales of million and an estimated reduction in net earnings of million 
net sales for were billion  as compared to billion in the year end drop off in prices and lower volumes caused this decrease 
net earnings for were billion  as compared to billion in  this decrease was primarily caused by the decreasing metal prices and lower sales volumes and higher production cost 
in  capital spending and exploration spending totaled million  as compared to million in included in spending is million for the tia maria project and million for the toquepala expansion project 
in we distributed billion in cash dividends to our shareholders  as compared to billion in in light of the current economic situation we will continue to monitor dividend distributions throughout please see our dividend policy under other liquidity considerations in this item 
in copper mine production decreased by million pounds from prior year  largely as a result of the strike at our cananea mine 
zinc and silver production  in also decreased  while molybdenum production increased slightly 
despite these decreases  we exceeded our production objectives at the open pit mines of toquepala  cuajone and la caridad  as well as at the immsa underground units of charcas  santa eulalia  santa barbara  the coking facility at nueva rosita and the la caridad precious metals plant 
a continuing area of concern for our company is the strike at our cananea mine  as well as taxco and san martin 
this strike began in july and continues into while positive judicial rulings have been issued a number of times  these have been generally followed by appeals that reversed the previous decisions 
most recently  in december  the mexican federal labor court ruled in favor of the company and declared the strike illegal 
the union appealed this decision and on january   the judge of the fifth district on labor matters annulled the favorable decision to the company 
we have filed a request for a review of this ruling before an appellate federal court 
we will continue to pursue a favorable resolution of the labor 
table of contents stoppage 
it is expected that production at cananea will remain suspended until these labor issues are resolved 
we estimate that these strikes have reduced production of copper and zinc in by million pounds and million pounds  respectively  and have reduced operating income by approximately billion 
we are hopeful of resolving these strikes in  but it is difficult to predict with any accuracy when this will occur 
we discuss below several matters that we believe are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition 
these include  i our operating cash costs as a measure of our performance  ii metal prices  iii business segments  iv the effect of inflation and other local currency issues and v our expansion and modernization program and environmental protection program 
operating cash costs an overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced 
operating cash cost is a non gaap measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies 
a reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound to the cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  amortization and depletion as presented in the consolidated statement of earnings is presented under the subheading  non gaap information reconciliation  below 
we have defined operating cash cost per pound as cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  amortization and depletion  plus selling  general and administrative charges  treatment and refining charges and by products revenue and sales premiums  less workers participation and other miscellaneous charges  including the peruvian royalty charge and the change in inventory levels  divided by total pounds of copper produced and purchased by us 
in our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced  we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of by products  principally molybdenum  zinc  silver and the premium over market price that we receive on copper sales 
we account for the by product revenue in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper 
we believe that our company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company  and is valued  in large part  by the investment community s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost 
we also include copper sales premiums as a credit  as these amounts are in excess of published copper prices 
the increase in recent years in the price of molybdenum  as well as increases in silver and zinc  has had a significant effect on our traditional calculation of cash cost and its comparability between periods 
accordingly  we present cash costs with and without crediting the by product revenues against our costs 
we exclude from our calculation of operating cash cost depreciation  amortization and depletion  which are considered non cash expenses 
exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded 
workers participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre tax earnings and are also excluded 
additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non recurring nature and the royalty charge 
our operating cash costs per pound  as defined  are presented in the table below for the three years ended december  we present cash costs with and without the inclusion of by product revenues 

table of contents positive negative variance cents per pound operating cash cost per pound of copper produced and purchased less by products revenue operating cash cost per pound of copper produced and purchased without by products revenue against as seen on the chart above  our cash cost per pound for when calculated with by products revenue are costs of cents per pound compared with a credit of cents per pound in the decrease in the by products credit in the period was largely due to lower molybdenum prices especially in the last quarter of the year 
the effect of lower molybdenum prices reduced the by products credit by approximately cents per pound for our per pound cash cost  excluding by product revenues  were higher by cents per pound in compared to due to a decrease of in copper production  principally as a result of the cananea mine strike  which increased cash cost by cents and the higher power and fuel cost which increased cash cost by cents 
against our cash cost per pound for when calculated with by products revenue was a credit of cents per pound compared with a cost of cents per pound in the increase in the by products credit in the period was largely due to higher molybdenum prices and sales volume 
the credit for molybdenum sales was cents per pound in as compared to cents per pound in our cash cost  excluding by product revenues  were higher by cents per pound in compared to and this was due to cents of higher production cost mainly labor  power and fuel cost as well as to cents per pound of higher freight due to the sale of concentrates which were partially offset by cents per pound of lower purchases of third party metals 
metals prices the profitability of our operations is dependent on  and our financial performance is significantly affected by  the international market prices for the products we produce  especially for copper  molybdenum  zinc and silver 
metals prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors  which affect each commodity to varying degrees  include international economic and political conditions  levels of supply and demand  the availability and cost of substitutes  inventory levels maintained by producers and others and  to a lesser degree  inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates 
in addition  the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short term changes due to speculative activities 
we are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices 
assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved  that tax rates are unchanged and giving no effects to potential hedging programs  metal price 
table of contents sensitivity factors would indicate the estimated change in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in as provided in the table below copper molybdenum zinc silver change in metal prices per pound except silver per ounce change in net earnings in millions business segments we view our company as having three operating segments and manage on the basis of these segments 
these segments are our peruvian operations  our mexican open pit operations and our mexican underground operations  known as our immsa unit 
our peruvian operations include the toquepala and cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants  industrial railroad and port facilities which service both mines 
the peruvian operations produce copper  with significant by product production of molybdenum  silver and other material 
our mexican open pit operations include la caridad and cananea mine complexes  the smelting and refining plants and support facilities which service both mines 
the mexican open pit operations produce copper  with significant by products production of molybdenum  silver and other material 
our immsa unit includes five underground mines that produce zinc  lead  copper  silver and gold  a coal mine which produces coal and coke  and several industrial processing facilities for zinc  copper and silver 
segment information is included in our review of results of operations and also in note of our consolidated financial statements 
inflation and devaluation of the peruvian nuevo sol and the mexican peso our functional currency is the us dollar 
portions of our operating costs are denominated in peruvian nuevos soles and mexican pesos 
since our revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars  when inflation deflation in peru or mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso  respectively  to the dollar  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation devaluation effects are passed onto us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments 
in addition  the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by devaluation of the nuevo sol or the peso  resulting in a remeasurement loss in our financial statements 
recent inflation and devaluation rates are provided in the table below 
year ended december  peru peruvian inflation rate nuevo sol dollar devaluation appreciation rate mexico mexican inflation rate peso dollar devaluation appreciation rate capital expansion program we made capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and we expect to make capital expenditures  of

set forth below are descriptions of some of our current expected capital expenditures 
the company expects to meet the cash requirements for these projects from cash on hand  internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required 
peruvian operations tia maria the tia maria project  which includes the tia maria and the la tapada deposits  is located in the department of arequipa on the southern coast of peru and is part of a copper porphyritic system 

table of contents the feasibility studies in for tia maria show million tons of mineralized material with copper content 
for la tapada  the estimated mineralized resources show million tons of mineralized material  with copper content 
in the company completed the basic engineering and started the detailed engineering studies for the project 
the environmental impact assessment is expected to be completed in the second quarter of as of december   we have spent million for the tia maria project 
we are currently evaluating whether to put on hold or to slow down the spending in light of current market conditions and capital equipment cost 
we estimate spending million on this project during  which includes funds necessary to complete environmental and engineering studies  as well as spending previously committed 
when completed the new operating unit is expected to produce  tons of copper cathodes per year 
toquepala concentrator expansion as of december   we have spent million for the toquepala expansion 
this project is designed to increase annual toquepala copper production by approximately  tons per year 
we completed the feasibility study 
the basic engineering is almost completed and detailed engineering will be started 
the environmental impact assessment is also underway and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of we expect to spend million in  to complete studies and for previously committed orders 
after that we will put on hold making any new additional capital spending commitments for this project 
cuajone concentrator expansion for the cuajone concentrator expansion project we have completed the feasibility study and will only continue at this point with the environmental impact assessment 
however  any further spending is being deferred pending improvement in economic conditions 
ilo smelter modernization this project was completed in january and has allowed our company to increase sulfur capture over the requirement established in our agreement with the peruvian government 
a complimentary project to the ilo smelter modernization is the construction of a marine trestle to offload the sulfuric acid produced at the smelter directly to offshore ships 
at december  this project reached completion and is expected to be completed in june the completed project is expected to ease congestion in our ilo area 
tailings disposal at quebrada honda this project will increase the height of the existing quebrada honda dam to impound future tailings from the toquepala and cuajone mills 
the procurement of the main equipment and materials was finished 
construction of the main civil and mechanical and electrical installations for the main and lateral dams has been completed 
the lateral dam was commissioned in december and the main dam will be commissioned in february progress on the first stage of this project is complete and the balance is expected to be completed by march the total cost of this project is estimated to be million  with million expended through december  mexican operations the company will continue with the environmental projects at its mining and metallurgical facilities 
at la caridad metallurgical complex the gas handling and dust and effluent treatment projects are being completed 
these projects are at and of completion  respectively  and have a combined budget of million for the agua prieta lime plant modernization project  in the mexican state of sonora  is moving forward to completion 
when finished  this project is expected to reduce the annual lime cost of our mexican operations by approximately million 
the capital budget for this project is million 

table of contents other expenditures regarding our copper deposit projects at los chancas in peru  el arco  pilares and the underground polymetallic mine in angangueo in mexico  we will continue to evaluate them  but will defer making a final decision until economic conditions improve 
all capital projects related to cananea are on hold pending resolution of the labor situation 
these include the new sx ew plant  the concentrator expansion and a molybdenum circuit at this operation 
potential projects we have a number of projects that we may develop in the future 
we evaluate new projects on the basis of our long term corporate objectives  expected return  environmental needs  required investment and estimated production  among other considerations 
all capital expenditures have been stopped or are under review 
we believe that this discipline is required in response to the weakened commodity prices and economic uncertainties 
the above information are estimates only 
we cannot make any assurance that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate
