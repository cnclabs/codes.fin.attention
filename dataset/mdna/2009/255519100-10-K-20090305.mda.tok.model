item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview over the last three years  demand for products manufactured by the united states carpet industry and our business has been significantly affected by declining demand as tighter credit conditions  lower consumer confidence and other economic factors reduced the level of new residential housing construction  the sales and refurbishment of existing homes and more recently  the levels of business construction and refurbishment activity 
as a result of the continuing market weakness  sales of our business declined in each of the last two years and over for the three year period ended december  during this same three year period  sales for the carpet industry were down approximately 
in the third and fourth quarters of  our sales began slowing at a greater rate than the sales of the carpet industry 
we believe our recent results reflect the impact of the overall downturn as it reaches the higher end of the market where our busin ess is concentrated 
while it is difficult to predict the length of the current downturn and its impact on the markets we serve  we believe our position in the upper end of the market will permit us to benefit from improved conditions and grow our sales at a rate that will exceed the rate of growth of the carpet industry  as and when economic conditions improve 
facility consolidations and costs reduction plan in response to the continued difficult economic conditions  we developed plans to consolidate our north georgia carpet tufting operation into our atmore  alabama tufting  dyeing and finishing facility  combine our two santa ana  california facilities and make organizational and other changes to reduce staff and expenses throughout our company 
the consolidation of our east coast tufting operations was substantially completed in the first quarter of expenses for the consolidation and organizational changes were million in and  included million for relocation of equipment and inventory and thousand for severance costs and employee relocation expenses 
approximately thousand of additional expenses are expected to complete the east coast facilities consolidation and organizational changes 
the east coast facility consolidations and organizational changes are expected to reduce costs and expenses by approximately million annually 
in addition  we suspended our match of certain k contributions for and lowered the compensation of our salaried associates effective march  these actions should reduce expenses by an additional million annually 
we are reviewing our alternatives for our west coast operation and are considering the possibility of selling this business  or more likely  consolidating it into our east coast facilities  beginning as early as the second half of if implemented  such a consolidation would further reduce costs  headcount and allow us to sell or lease our california real estate 
the costs to fully implement this consolidation should be approximately million to million  and we expect a payback of one year or less 
the sale of our california real estate would permit the company to significantly further reduce debt 
in  we reduced total employment by approximately 
the sale or consolidation of our west coast operations into our east coast facilities should reduce employment by another to 
goodwill and long lived asset impairments as a result of the effect of economic conditions on our business  we evaluated the recoverability of goodwill associated with our reporting units during the third quarter of and twice in the fourth quarter of the evaluation compares the carrying amount of our reporting units  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model 
for these purposes  fair value is an estimate of the value of the reporting units current and future cash flows  discounted at our weighted average cost of capital wacc 
no potential goodwill impairment was indicated when we evaluated the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of when our annual goodwill impairment evaluation was performed in october of  we reduced our projections for the future sales and profitability of our reporting units  because economic conditions in the carpet industry had continued to deteriorate 
in addition  higher interest rates for year treasury constant maturities and moody s baa bonds increased our wacc 
as a result of the decline in the cash flow projections for our reporting units and the higher wacc  goodwill was potentially impaired in the two reporting units that had goodwill associated with their operations 
because our assessment indicated that goodwill may not be fully recoverable  we performed the second step in the goodwill evaluation process by comparing the implied fair value of our reporting units goodwill with the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill 
for this purpose  the implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit that has goodwill page associated with its operations was determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill is determined in a business combination 
the measurement resulted in the impairment of all of the goodwill  or million  associated with the acquisition of patrick carpet mills  inc in and million  or approximately of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of fabrica international  inc in the total non cash goodwill impairment loss recognized in the fourth quarter of was million 
all remaining goodwill on our balance sheet at december  is associated with the acquisition of fabrica international  inc we retested goodwill for impairment at the end of the fourth quarter of and no additional impairment was indicated 
considering seasonal factors  economic conditions in the carpet industry at that date had not significantly changed and our future sales and profitability expectations were unchanged 
additionally  our wacc decreased from to by the end of the fourth quarter due to decreases in the rates for year treasury constant maturities and moody s baa bonds 
our facility consolidations and cost reduction plan identified certain assets  primarily computer software  which would not be utilized in our ongoing operations 
as a result  the company recorded million of non cash asset impairments to reflect the loss in value of these assets in the fourth quarter of results of operations our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with u 
s

continued weakness in residential carpet markets had a negative impact on the sales of the carpet industry and our business 
nevertheless  our sales continued to significantly outpace the sales of the carpet industry  which reported that carpet sales declined  with residential carpet sales down and commercial carpet sales improving  compared with the prior year 
our year over year carpet net sales comparison reflected a decline  with net sales of residential carpet down and net sales of commercial carpet growing

revenue from carpet yarn processing and carpet dyeing and finishing services decreased in  compared with cost of sales 
the percentage point decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales in  compared with was principally attributable to higher selling prices  improved product mix and operational performance

we expect capital page expenditures to be approximately million in  while depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately million 
capital expenditures in will be primarily for newly designed manufacturing technology 
in october  we amended and restated our senior loan and security agreement to extend the term of the agreement 
the amended and restated senior loan and security agreement matures on may  and provides million of credit  consisting of million of revolving credit and a million term loan 
the term loan is payable in monthly principal installments of thousand and is due may  interest rates available under the amended and restated senior loan and security agreement may be selected from a number of options that effectively allow us to borrow at rates ranging from the lender s prime rate plus to the lender s prime rate plus for base rate loans  or at rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus for libor loans

the levels of our accounts receiv able and inventory limit the borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility 
the facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
the amended and restated senior loan and security agreement does not contain ongoing financial covenants and permits payment of dividends and repurchases of our common stock in an aggregate annual amount of up to million and distributions in excess of million under conditions specified in the agreement

unused borrowing capacity under the amended and restated senior loan and security agreement on december  was million 
effective january   the amended and restated senior loan and security agreement was further amended to modify certain interest rate definitions to change the relative relationship between base rates and libor rates as used in the agreement and to reduce the applicable credit spreads for base rate loans by

accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits of thousand as of december   have been excluded from the summary of contractual obligations 
we believe our operating cash flows  credit availability under our senior loan and security agreement and other sources of financing are adequate to finance our normal liquidity requirements 
however  significant additional cash expenditures above our normal liquidity requirements or significant further deterioration in economic conditions that affect our business could require supplemental financing or other funding sources 
there can be no assurance that such supplemental financing or other sources of funding can be obtained or will be obtained on terms favorable to us 
income tax considerations 
approximately million of income tax refunds are expected in due to overpayments of estimated income taxes and carrybacks of net operating loss to prior years 
other than these income tax refunds  we do not anticipate that cash outlays for income taxes will be materially different from our provision for income taxes during the next three fiscal years 
approximately thousand of state net operating loss and income tax credit carryforward benefits are expected to be utilized in the future 
during  we increased our tax valuation reserve related to future benefits for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards by million 
critical accounting policies certain estimates and assumptions are made when preparing our financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including amounts reported for assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  and amounts reported for revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods presented 
estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict 
as a result  actual amounts could differ from estimates made when our financial statements are prepared 
the securities and exchange commission requires management to identify its most critical accounting policies  defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and the application of which requires our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
although our estimates have not differed materially from our experience  such estimates pertain to inherently uncertain matters that could result in material differences in subsequent periods 
we believe application of the following accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates and represent our critical accounting policies 
other significant accounting policies are discussed in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues  including shipping and handling amounts  are recognized when the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence that a sales agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title to products shipped and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership  which is generally on the date of shipment 
at the time revenue is recognized  we record a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based primarily on historical experience and any known trends or conditions 
accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and periodic evaluations of the financial condition of our customers 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to significantly deteriorate  or other factors impair their ability to pay their debts  credit losses could differ from allowances recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
customer claims and product warranties 
we provide product warranties related to manufacturing defects and specific performance standards for our products 
we record reserves for the estimated costs of defective products and failure to meet applicable performance standards 
the levels of reserves are established based primarily upon historical experience and our evaluation of pending claims 
because our evaluations are based on historical experience and conditions at the time our financial statements are prepared  actual results could differ from the reserves in our consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method lifo  which generally matches current costs of inventory sold with current revenues  for substantially all page inventories 
reserves are also established to adjust inventories that are off quality  aged or obsolete to their estimated net realizable value 
additionally  rates of recoverability per unit of off quality  obsolete or excessive inventory are estimated based on historical rates of recoverability and other known conditions or circumstances that may affect future recoverability 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value our inventory 
goodwill 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing 
this test is based on the fair value of the underlying assets and businesses to which the goodwill applies based on estimates of future cash flows  which require judgments and assumptions about future economic factors that are difficult to predict 
changes in our judgments and assumptions about future economic factors could materially change our estimate of values and could materially impact the value of goodwill and our consolidated financial statements 
self insured accruals 
we estimate costs required to settle claims related to our self insured medical  dental and workers compensation plans 
these estimates include costs to settle known claims  as well as incurred and unreported claims 
the estimated costs of known and unreported claims are based on historical experience 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to estimate these accruals 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory income tax rates that are expected to be applicable in future periods when temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of changes in income tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that a change in income tax rates is enacted 
taxing jurisdictions could disagree with our tax treatment of various items in a manner that could affect the tax treatment of such items in the future 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using existing laws  rules and regulations  each of which is subject to change 
stock based awards we recognize compensation expense related to share based stock awards based on the fair value of the equity instrument over the period of vesting for the individual stock awards that were granted 
at december   the total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested restricted stock awards was million with a weighted average vesting period of years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands the company s earnings  cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to interest rates 
it is the company s policy to minimize its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates and manage interest rate risks inherent in funding the company with debt 
the company addresses this financial exposure through a risk management program that includes maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and the use of derivative financial instruments 
at december   the company was a party to an interest rate swap agreement on its mortgage note payable with a notional amount equal to the outstanding balance of the mortgage note  at december  which expires in march of under the interest rate swap agreement  the company pays a fixed rate of interest of times the notional amount and receives in return an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
the swap agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on the mortgage note payable at 
on october   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  through may  under this agreement  the company pays a fixed rate of interest of times the notional amount and receives in return a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
the interest rate swap agreement is linked to the company s variable rate debt and is considered a highly effective hedge 
at december    or approximately of the company s total debt  was subject to floating interest rates 
a fluctuation in the variable interest rates applicable to this floating rate debt would have an annual after tax impact of approximately page
