item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate two types of businesses funeral homes  which account for approximately of our revenues  and cemeteries  which account for approximately of our revenues 
funeral homes are principally a service business that provide funeral services burial and cremation and sell related merchandise  such as caskets and urns 
cemeteries are primarily a sales business that sells interment rights grave sites and mausoleums and related merchandise such as markers and outer burial containers 
as of december   we operated funeral homes in states and cemeteries in states within the united states 
substantially all administrative activities are conducted in our home office in houston  texas 
factors affecting our funeral operating results include demographic trends in terms of population growth and average age  which impact death rates and number of deaths  establishing and maintaining leading market share positions supported by strong local heritage and relationships  effectively responding to increasing cremation trends by packaging complementary services and merchandise  controlling salary and merchandise costs  and exercising pricing leverage related to our at need business to increase average revenues per contract 
in simple terms  volume and price are the two variables that affect funeral revenues 
the average revenue per contract is influenced by the mix of traditional and cremation services because our average cremation service revenue is approximately one third of the average revenue earned from a traditional burial service 
funeral homes have a relatively fixed cost structure 
thus  small changes in revenues  up or down  normally cause significant changes to our profitability the cemetery operating results are affected by the size and success of our sales organization 
approximately of our cemetery revenues relate to preneed sales of interment rights and mausoleums and related merchandise and services 
we believe that changes in the level of consumer confidence a measure of whether consumers will spend for discretionary items also affect the amount of cemetery revenues 
approximately of our cemetery revenues are attributable to investment earnings on trust funds and finance charges on installment contracts 
changes in the capital markets and interest rates affect this component of our cemetery revenues 
we have implemented several significant long term initiatives in our operations designed to improve operating and financial results by growing market share and increasing profitability 
we introduced a more decentralized  entrepreneurial and local operating model that included operating and financial standards developed from our best operations  along with an incentive compensation plan to reward business managers for successfully meeting or exceeding the standards 
the model essentially eliminated the use of financial budgets in favor of the standards 
the operating model and standards  which we refer to as being the best  focus on the key drivers of a successful operation  organized around three primary areas market share  people and operating and financial metrics 
the model and standards are the measures by which we judge the success of each business 
to date  the being the best operating model and standards have driven significant changes in our organization  leadership and operating practices acquisitions our growth strategy includes the execution of the strategic portfolio optimization model 
the goal of that model is to build concentrated groups of businesses in ten to fifteen strategic markets 
we assess acquisition candidates using six strategic ranking criteria and to differentiate the price we are willing to pay 
those criteria are size of business size of market competitive standing demographics strength of brand barriers to entry in general terms  our price expectations range from four to five times pre tax earnings before depreciation for tuck ins to six to seven times pre tax earnings before depreciation for businesses that rank very high in the ranking criteria 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  realization of accounts receivable  inventories  intangible assets  property and equipment and deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  third party data and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these considerations form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying value of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  because there can be no assurance the margins  operating income and net earnings as a percentage of revenues will be consistent from year to year 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements presented herewith  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states excluding certain year end adjustments because of the interim nature of the consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
funeral and cemetery operations we record the sales of funeral and cemetery merchandise and services when the merchandise is delivered or service is performed 
sales of cemetery interment rights are recorded as revenue in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
this method generally provides for the recognition of revenue in the period in which the customer s cumulative payments exceed of the contract price related to the real estate 
costs related to the sales of interment rights  which include property and other costs related to cemetery development activities  are charged to operations using the specific identification method in the period in which the sale of the interment right is recognized as revenue 
revenues to be recognized and cash flow from the delivery of merchandise and performance of services related to preneed contracts that were acquired in acquisitions are typically lower than those originated by us 
allowances for bad debts and customer cancellations are provided at the date that the sale is recognized as revenue 
in addition  we monitor changes in delinquency rates and provide additional bad debt and cancellation reserves when warranted 
when preneed funeral services and merchandise are funded through third party insurance policies  we earn a commission on the sale of the policies 
insurance commissions earned by the company are recognized as revenues when the commission is no longer subject to refund  which is usually one year after the policy is issued 
preneed selling costs consist of sales commissions that we pay our sales counselors and other direct related costs of originating preneed sales contracts and are expensed as incurred 
goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired  as determined by management in transactions accounted for as purchases  is recorded as goodwill 
many of the acquired funeral homes have provided high quality service to families for generations 
the resulting loyalty often represents a substantial portion of the value of a funeral business 
goodwill is typically not associated with or recorded for the cemetery businesses 
in accordance with fas no 
 goodwill and other tangible assets  we review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually on reporting units aggregated geographically to determine if facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that this intangible asset might be carried in excess of fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the businesses in each reporting unit at our weighted average cost of capital less debt allocable to the reporting unit and by reference to recent sales transactions of similar businesses 
the calculation of fair value can vary dramatically with changes in estimates of the number of future services performed  inflation in costs  and the company s cost of capital  which is impacted by long term interest rates 
if impairment is indicated  then an adjustment will be made to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to fair value 
a more complete discussion of the goodwill impairment testing is included later in item of this form k 
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated us federal income tax return and separate income tax returns in the states in which we operate 
we record deferred taxes for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes and account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb no 

the company records a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain 
management reviews the valuation allowance at the end of each quarter and makes adjustments if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
in june  fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized  measured  and derecognized in financial statements  requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters  specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the balance sheet  and provides transition and interim period guidance  among other provisions 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and was adopted by the company as of january  we have reviewed our income tax positions and identified certain tax deductions  primarily related to business acquisitions that are not certain 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin has been recorded as a reduction to the opening balance of retained earnings and an increase in noncurrent liabilities in the amount of million which includes accrued interest and penalties totaling million 
our policy with respect to potential penalties and interest is to record them as other expense and interest expense  respectively 
stock compensation plans the company has stock based employee compensation plans in the form of restricted stock  performance unit  stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
the company accounts for stock based compensation under sfas no 
r  share based payment fas no 
r 
fas no 
r requires companies to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payment issued to employees over the period of vesting 
the fair value of stock options and awards containing options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
fas no 
applies to all transactions involving issuance of equity by a company in exchange for goods and services  including employee services 
preneed funeral and cemetery trust funds the company s preneed and perpetual care trust funds are reported in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 as revised  fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 

the investments of such trust funds are classified as available for sale and are reported at market value  therefore  an allocation of unrealized gains and losses  income and gains and losses are recorded to deferred preneed receipts held in trust and care trusts corpus in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company s future obligations to deliver merchandise and services are reported at estimated settlement amounts 
unrealized gains and losses and attributable to the company  but that have not been earned through the performance of services or delivery of merchandise are allocated to deferred revenues 
although fin r requires consolidation of preneed and perpetual care trusts  it did not change the legal relationships among the trusts  the company and its customers 
in the case of preneed trusts  the customers are the legal beneficiaries 
in the case of perpetual care trusts  the company does not have a right to access the corpus in the perpetual care trusts 
for these reasons  the company has recognized financial interests of third parties in the trust funds in our financial statements as deferred preneed funeral and cemetery receipts held in trust and care trusts corpus 
business combinations tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value and goodwill is recognized for any difference between the price of the acquisition and our fair value determination 
we customarily estimate our purchase costs and other related transactions known at closing 
to the extent that information not available to us at the closing date subsequently becomes available during the allocation period we may adjust goodwill  assets  or liabilities associated with the acquisition 
discontinued operations in accordance with the company s strategic portfolio optimization model  non strategic businesses are reviewed to determine whether the business should be sold and the proceeds redeployed elsewhere 
a marketing plan is then developed for those locations which are identified as held for sale 
when the company receives a letter of intent and financing commitment from the buyer and the sale is expected to occur within one year  the location is no longer reported within the company s continuing operations 
the assets and liabilities associated with the location are reclassified as held for sale on the balance sheet and the operating results  as well as impairments  are presented on a comparative basis in the discontinued operations section of the consolidated statements of operations  along with the income tax effect 
fair value measurements effective january   we apply fas which defines fair value as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fas requires disclosure of the extent to which fair value is used to measure financial assets and liabilities  the inputs utilized in calculating valuation measurements  and the effect of the measurement of significant unobservable inputs on earnings  or changes in net assets  as of the measurement date 
fasb staff position no 
fas fsp  issued in february  delayed the effective date of fas no 
for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  until fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted fas no 
effective january   with the exceptions allowed under fsp  the adoption of which has not affected our financial position or results of operations but did result in additional required disclosures  which are provided in note in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas no 

fas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
fas no 
was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not elected to apply the provisions of statement no 
to any additional financial instruments  therefore  the adoption of statement no 
effective january  has not affected our financial position or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncments and accounting changes business combinations in december  the fasb issued fas no 
revised  business combinations fas no 
r 
fas no 
r requires the acquiring entity to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at the fair values as of that date 
goodwill is measured as a residual of the fair values at acquisition date 
acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  that adoption of fas no 
r will have on its consolidated financial statements 
non controlling interests in december  the fasb issued sfas no  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary  which is sometimes referred to as unconsolidated investment  is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements 
among other requirements  sfas requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the non controlling interest 
it also requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated income statement  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest 
the provisions of sfas are effective for us on january  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
during our examination of sfas and its impact on our current accounting  we determined that balances historically designated as non controlling interest in our consolidated preneed funeral and cemetery trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts do not meet the criteria for non controlling interest as prescribed by sfas sfas indicates that only a financial instrument classified as equity in the trusts financial statements can be a non controlling interest in the consolidated financial statements 
the interest related to our merchandise and service trusts is classified as a liability because the preneed contracts underlying these trusts are unconditionally redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is certain to occur 
since the earnings from our cemetery perpetual care trusts are used to support the maintenance of our cemeteries  we believe the interest in these trusts also retains the characteristics of a liability 
accordingly  effective december   the amounts historically described as non controlling interest in funeral and cemetery trusts are characterized as either deferred preneed funeral receipts held in trust or deferred preneed cemetery receipts held in trust  as appropriate 
the amounts historically described as non controlling interest in cemetery perpetual care trusts are characterized as care trusts corpus

our cemetery businesses suffered a million decline in pre tax operating profit  equal to per diluted share 
corporate costs and expenses increased million from primarily due to increases in legal costs and severance expenses

the acquired businesses have a product mix that is cremation services 
cremation services represented of the number of funeral services during  compared to for the average revenue for all burial contracts increased to  while the average revenue for cremation contracts decreased to  we have addressed the growing demand for cremation by training the funeral directors to present multiple merchandise and service options to families  resulting in choices that produce higher revenues

earnings from perpetual care trust funds are included in financial revenues and totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the year over year improvements were largely due to realized gains in equity investments which appreciated in line with the corresponding markets 
other 
general and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended december  primarily because we upgraded our consolidation platform systems  infrastructure and people 
during  we made significant improvements in numerous home office departments including strategic development  legal  human resources and training  all of which were under new leadership compared to prior years 
we view any controllable overhead above our individual businesses as a support cost that needs to be value added to our field operating leadership  our employees and to our client families 
other increases related primarily to four areas unusually high litigation costs in four cases  higher employee matching contributions under our k program  higher recruiting fees related to successful operating leadership searches  and incentive compensation based on performance 
we paid out more incentive compensation during than at any time in our history and have converted of our managing partner incentive compensation to standards achievement 
interest income and other  net for the year ended december  was primarily interest income on the short term investments 
interest income declined during the year as a direct result of our investments maturing and cash was used for the acquisitions 
income taxes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the income taxes for and goodwill impairment testing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of funeral home businesses acquired in business combinations is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill has not historically been recorded in connection with the acquisition of cemetery businesses 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment by assessing the fair value of each of our reporting units 
for the year  our funeral segment reporting units consisted of our east  central and west regions in the united states 
we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas using information as of august  our goodwill impairment test involves estimates and management judgment 
in the first step of our goodwill testing  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both a market approach  weighted  and an income approach  weighted 
funeral home selling prices are typically quoted in the marketplace as a multiple of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our methodology for determining a market approach fair value utilized recent sales transactions in the industry  which ranged from to times ebitda 
our methodology for determining an income based fair value is based on discounting projected future cash flows 
the projected future cash flows include assumptions concerning future operating performance that may differ from actual future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital for carriage and other public deathcare companies 
goodwill impairment is not recorded where the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the implied fair value of goodwill as defined in sfas is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill and if the carrying amount exceeds the implied value  an impairment charge would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
based on our impairment test performed using august  data  we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill 
in addition to our annual review  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be greater than fair value 
factors that could trigger an interim impairment review include  but are not limited to significant adverse changes in the business climate which may be indicated by a decline in the company s market capitalization or decline in operating results 
the market capitalization of the company consists of the common stock  senior notes and convertible trust preferred securities all of which declined in market value during the fourth quarter of the decline in market capitalization may have resulted from the decline in the company s operating profits compared to the prior year 
we performed an additional impairment test based on december  information and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill 
additionally  we researched the other public companies in our industry for evidence of goodwill impairment in their funeral reporting units and found that there were none 
the decline in operating profits was due to the decline in operating profits from the cemetery segment which is much more sensitive to economic conditions because it is reliant on preneed sales which are impacted by consumer discretionary income 
as previously discussed  goodwill is not recorded on cemeteries 
the earnings and cash flow from the funeral segment was not negatively impacted by the economy in and is not cyclical in nature 
the number of deaths in the united states is relatively stable year to year and is projected to increase with the aging of the baby boomers 
the number of funeral services provided and the average price realized per service by carriage increased year over year 
if economic conditions worsen causing deterioration in our financial operating results  we may have another triggering event that could result in an impairment of our goodwill in liquidity and capital resources while the impact has not been dramatic yet  we believe the adverse economic conditions in the us will continue to effect our business and may impair our ability to access the capital markets  if needed 
carriage began with million in cash and other liquid investments and ended the year with million in cash and an undrawn million line of credit 
the elements of cash flow for consisted of the following in millions cash and liquid investments at beginning of year cash flow from operations cash flow from discontinued operations proceeds from sales of businesses cash used for maintenance capital expenditures cash used for growth capital expenditures funeral homes cash used for growth capital expenditures cemeteries other investing and financing activities cash at end of year the outstanding principal of senior debt at december  totaled million and consisted of million in senior notes  described below  and million in acquisition indebtedness and capital lease obligations 
additionally  million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the credit facility at december  in january  we issued million of unsecured senior notes at par 
interest is payable quarterly in january and july 
the senior notes are due in the company has a million senior secured revolving credit facility that matures in april and is collateralized by all personal property and funeral home real property in certain states 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either prime or libor options 
at december   the libor option was set at libor plus basis points 
the facility is undrawn  except for the letters of credit referred to above  at december  a total of million was outstanding at december  on the convertible junior subordinated debenture 
amounts outstanding under the debenture are payable to our affiliate trust  carriage services capital trust  bear interest at and mature in substantially all the assets of the trust consist of the convertible junior subordinated debentures 
in  the trust issued million shares of term income deferrable equity securities tides 
the rights of the debentures are functionally equivalent to those of the tides 
the convertible junior subordinated debenture payable to the affiliated trust  and the tides  each contain a provision for the deferral of interest payments and distributions for up to consecutive quarters 
during any period in which distribution payments are deferred  distributions will continue to accumulate at the annual rate 
also  the deferred distributions themselves accumulate distributions at the annual rate of 
during any deferral period  carriage is prohibited from paying dividends on common stock or repurchasing common stock  subject to limited exceptions 
the company currently expects to continue paying the distributions as due 
the company intends to use its cash  cash flow and proceeds from the sale of businesses  to repurchase common stock  acquire funeral home and cemetery businesses and for internal growth projects  such as cemetery inventory development 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have an active share repurchase program for which the board of directors approved for the company to purchase up to million of its common stock 
at december   approximately million was still available to spend under the program 
the company also has the ability to draw on our revolving credit facility  subject to customary terms and conditions of the credit agreement 
we believe our cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and the available capacity under our credit facility described above will be adequate to meet our working capital needs and other financial obligations over the next twelve month 
however  should the current economic crisis continue for a significant period of time or if the economic crisis worsens significantly  conditions may negatively affect our ability to refinance our long term debt in future periods

if we are not able to meet these obligations with cash provided for by our operating activities  we may be required to access the capital markets or draw down on our credit facilities both of which may be more likely and more difficult to access due to the current economic crisis 
seasonality our business can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the death rate 
generally  the rate is higher during the winter months because the incidences of death from influenza and pneumonia are higher during this period than other periods of the year

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are typically exposed to a variety of market risks 
currently  these are primarily related to changes in market values related to outstanding debts and changes in the values of securities associated with the preneed and perpetual care trusts 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and developing and utilizing appropriate risk management techniques when appropriate and when available for a reasonable price 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks including commodity price risk  nor foreign currency exchange risk 
we monitor current and forecasted interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business and seek to maintain optimal financial flexibility  quality and solvency 
as of december   our outstanding debt is comprised of entirely fixed rate obligations 
we do not currently have any floating rate long term borrowings outstanding under our million floating rate line of credit 
if we borrow against the line of credit  any change in the floating rate would cause a change in interest expense 
the senior notes were issued to the public at par and are carried at a cost of million 
at december   these securities were typically trading at a price of approximately 
the convertible junior subordinated debentures  payable to carriage services capital trust  pay interest at the fixed rate of and are carried on our balance sheet at a cost of approximately million 
the estimated fair value of these securities is estimated to be million at december  based on available broker quotes of the corresponding preferred securities issued by the trust 
increases in market interest rates may cause the value of these debt instruments to decrease but such changes will not affect our interest costs 
the remainder of the our long term debt and leases consist of non interest bearing notes and fixed rate instruments that do not trade in a market  nor otherwise have a quoted market value 
any increase in market interest rates causes the fair value of those liabilities to decrease 
securities subject to market risk consist of investments held by our preneed funeral  cemetery merchandise and services and perpetual care trust funds 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for the estimated fair values of those securities 
the sensitivity of the fixed income securities is such that a change in interest rates causes an approximate change in the value of the fixed income securities
