item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused on developing products which can provide improved efficacy  safety or patient convenience in the treatment of acute and chronic pain and pain related conditions 
we operate a business model that focuses on the following obtaining patents for innovative ideas which we believe have value in the marketplace  utilizing a small group of talented employees to develop those ideas through proof of concept by working with strategic outsource partners  
table of contents agreeing a regulatory pathway with the appropriate agency  and licensing the resulting product or technology to a strong pharmaceutical partner to commercialize 
we hire experts with strong project management skills in the specific disciplines we believe are important to maintain within our company 
we contract with and manage strong outsource partners as we complete the necessary development work  permitting us to avoid incurring the cost of buying or building laboratories  manufacturing facilities or clinical research operation sites 
this allows us to control our annual expenses  but to utilize best in class resources as required 
after we establish the proof of concept for an innovative idea  we work with the us food and drug administration  or fda  or foreign regulatory agencies to design a clear path forward to the filing of a new drug application  or nda  or its foreign equivalent 
we may then decide to seek a strong pharmaceutical partner to license the product or technology to collaborate with us in the remaining development and to commercialize the product or technology after approval 
the success of our business is highly dependent on the marketplace value of our ideas and the related patents we obtain  our ability to obtain from the required regulatory agencies approval to sell the developed products and our ability to find strong commercial partners to successfully commercialize the products 
we have developed treximet formerly known as trexima in collaboration with glaxosmithkline  or gsk 
treximet is the brand name for the product combining sumatriptan mg  formulated with rt technology and naproxen sodium mg in a single tablet designed for the acute treatment of migraine 
on april   the fda approved treximet for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults 
upon receipt of fda approval  gsk notified us of its intention to launch the product and treximet was available in pharmacies in may treximet incorporates our mt technology  which refers to our proprietary combinations of a triptan htb d agonist and a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug  or nsaid 
under our mt technology  we sought to develop product candidates that provide acute migraine therapy by combining the activity of two drugs that act by different mechanisms to reduce the pain and associated symptoms of migraine 
we filed the nda for treximet with the fda in august  and in june we received an approvable letter requiring us to provide certain additional safety information relating to treximet  some of which required new studies 
an approvable letter is an official notification from the fda that contains conditions that must be satisfied prior to obtaining final us marketing approval 
in early january  we delivered a full response to this approvable letter that provided additional data and analyses and supporting information addressing the fda s safety concerns  including cardiovascular safety 
on august   we received a second approvable letter from the fda for treximet in which the fda requested that we further address the fda s concern about the product s potential for genotoxicity 
in response to this approvable letter  we submitted the results of three non clinical in vitro studies that provided clarifying information about the chinese hamster ovary  or cho  assay and data from a clinical evaluation of the genotoxic potential of treximet in human volunteers which indicated that no chromosomal aberrations were induced in peripheral blood lymphocytes when treximet was administered to volunteers for seven days 
on april   the fda approved treximet for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults 
we are also developing product candidates that combine a type of acid inhibitor  a proton pump inhibitor  or ppi  with an nsaid our pn program 
these product candidates are intended to provide management of pain and inflammation associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis  and are intended to have fewer gastrointestinal complications compared to an nsaid taken alone 
in august  we entered into an exclusive global collaboration and license agreement with astrazeneca ab  or astrazeneca  to co develop and commercialize proprietary fixed dose combinations of the ppi esomeprazole magnesium with the nsaid naproxen in a single tablet using our pn formulation technology  which agreement was amended in september we began the phase program in september as part of the program  conducted two phase pivotal trials in patients who are at risk for developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers  the primary endpoint for which was the reduction in endoscopic gastric ulcers 
in october  he fda informed us that it was conducting an internal review of the acceptability of using endoscopic gastric ulcers as a primary endpoint in clinical trials 
in late january  fda informed us that it had completed its internal discussions and that there was no change to previous agreements that gastric ulcer incidence was an acceptable primary endpoint for pozen s clinical programs 
the two pivotal trials have been completed and met their primary endpoints 
in both trials  patients taking pn experienced significantly fewer endoscopically confirmed gastric ulcers compared to subjects receiving enteric coated naproxen during the six month treatment period 
in addition to the phase pivotal trials  we are conducting a long term  open label safety study 
we have terminated a non pivotal smaller study in patients at high risk of gastrointestinal related events from nsaids which we believe is not required for approval 
we are also conducting additional studies  for which astrazeneca is paying us to conduct 

table of contents another product candidate  pa  a combination of a ppi and aspirin  is currently in formulation and clinical development testing 
our pa product candidates are excluded from our agreement with astrazeneca 
we have met with the fda to discuss the overall development program requirements 
an investigational new drug application  or ind  was filed in the fourth quarter of we have completed a study which demonstrated the bioequivalence of the salicylic acid component of pa as compared to mg of enteric coated aspirin which we believe will satisfy the fda s bioequivalence requirement 
we filed a special protocol assessment  or spa  with the fda for the design of the phase studies for the product  the primary endpoint for which is the reduction in endoscopic gastric ulcers 
the spa is a process by which the fda and a company reach agreement on the phase pivotal trial protocol design  clinical endpoints and statistical analyses that are acceptable to support regulatory approval 
in october  the fda informed us that it was conducting an internal review of the acceptability of using endoscopic gastric ulcers as a primary endpoint in clinical trials 
in late january  fda informed us that it had completed its internal discussions and that there was no change to previous agreements that gastric ulcer incidence was an acceptable primary endpoint for our clinical programs 
in february  we received written confirmation from the fda that endoscopic gastric ulcer incidence was an acceptable primary endpoint for the phase clinical studies we proposed in our spa for pa we are also conducting both formulation development and early stage clinical studies with new product concepts that are currently in the exploratory stage 
if warranted  we may file us and international patent applications with claims directed toward these novel combinations and formulations 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception and have not yet generated significant revenue from product sales 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we record revenue under two categories licensing revenues and development revenues 
our licensing revenues include upfront payments upon contract signing  additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product s development or commercialization are reached  and the royalty payments based on product sales 
additionally  our development revenues include the billings for the direct costs and certain personnel related time incurred in performing additional development activities described under our collaboration agreements 
our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including clinical trial activities for our product candidates and general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses include salaries and benefits for personnel involved in our research and development activities and direct development costs  which include costs relating to the formulation and manufacturing of our product candidates  costs relating to preclinical studies  including toxicology studies  and clinical trials  and costs relating to compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to the development of our product candidates 
since inception  our research and development expenses have represented approximately of our total operating expenses 
for the fiscal year ended december   our research and development expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses 
we expect that we may continue to incur operating losses over the next several years as we complete the development and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates  develop other product candidates and acquire and develop product portfolios in other therapeutic areas 
our results may vary depending on many factors  including the progress of our pn and pa product candidates and our other product candidates in the clinical and regulatory process  the ability of gsk to successfully commercialize treximet in the us for example  treximet was available in pharmacies within one month from the date of its approval  but promotional and professional materials for the product  including direct to consumer advertising  were not approved on a timely basis by the fda 
the lack of approved materials and delayed advertising launch may have had an adverse impact on uptake of the product  thus negatively impacting our royalty revenue  the establishment of new collaborations and progress and or maintenance of our existing collaborations for the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates  and the acquisition and or in licensing  and development of our therapeutic product candidates 

table of contents we do not currently have commercialization or manufacturing capabilities 
we have entered into collaborations and may enter into additional collaborations with established pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical services companies to commercialize and manufacture our product candidates once approved 
our ability to generate revenue is dependent upon our ability  alone or with collaborators  to achieve the milestones set forth in our collaboration agreements  to enter into additional collaboration agreements  and successfully develop product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and commercialize our future products 
these milestones are earned when we have satisfied the criteria set out in our revenue recognition footnote accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these payments generate large non recurring revenue that will cause large fluctuations in quarterly and annual profit and loss 
status and expenses related to our product candidates there follows a brief discussion of the status of the development of our product candidates  as well as the costs relating to our development activities 
our direct research and development expenses were million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   and million for the fiscal year ended december  our research and development expenses that are not direct development costs consist of personnel and other research and development departmental costs and are not allocated by product candidate 
we generally do not maintain records that allocate our employees time by the projects on which they work and  therefore  are unable to identify costs related to the time that employees spend on research and development by product candidate 
total compensation and benefit costs for our personnel involved in research and development were million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   and million for the fiscal year ended december  total compensation for  and  respectively included a million  million and a million charge for non cash compensation for stock option expense resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
r on january  other research and development department costs were million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   and million for the fiscal year ended december  treximet 
on april   the fda approved treximet for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults 
gsk notified us of its intention to launch the product and was available in pharmacies in may as part of our nda program for treximet  we conducted five phase trials  two phase pivotal trials  and one month open label safety trial using a formulation of treximet developed by gsk 
the phase pivotal trials  including the endpoints required to evaluate treximet  were designed to demonstrate superiority to placebo for relief of pain and the associated symptoms of migraine nausea  photophobia and phonophobia at two hours 
additionally  the program was designed to demonstrate that each component makes a contribution to the efficacy of treximet the combination drug rule that the fda requires of all combination products 
the efficacy endpoint for the combination was sustained pain free  which is defined as improvement from moderate or severe pain to no pain at two hours and remaining at no pain through twenty four hours without the use of rescue medicine 
further  gsk continues to conduct market support studies for treximet 
as required by the terms of our agreement with gsk  we transferred ownership of the nda and other regulatory filings for treximet to gsk on may   and gsk now has responsibility for all ongoing regulatory obligations for the product  including post marketing clinical trial requirements 
we incurred million in direct development costs associated with the development of mt treximet for the fiscal year ended december  we received in the fiscal year ended december   million in milestone payments from gsk for the approval of  and gsk s intent to commercialize treximet and we recorded million of treximet royalty revenue  of which million is in accounts receivable at december  we billed gsk million for treximet activities for the fiscal year ended december  our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
we received notices of paragraph iv certifications from par pharmaceutical  inc  or par  and alphapharm pty ltd  alphapharm  and its designated agent  mylan pharmaceuticals inc  or mylan  informing us that each company had filed an anda with the fda seeking approval to market sumatriptan mg naproxen sodium mg tablets 
par and alphapharm have each indicated that they intend to market a generic version of treximet tablets before the expiration of us patent nos 
  and  gsk advised us that it elected not to exercise its first right to bring an infringement suits against par and alphapharm 
we filed suit against par in on november  in the federal court of the eastern district of texas 
we filed suit against alphapharm and mylan on january   also in the federal court of the eastern district of texas 
both actions have been consolidated into one suit 
upon filing of a patent infringement lawsuit against the filer of an anda  approval of such anda would automatically be stayed  or barred  for months  or until an adverse court decision is entered  whichever may occur earlier 
treximet currently has regulatory exclusivity through april  and such exclusivity can be extended by months by completing pediatric studies 
pediatric studies are underway and expected to complete in 
table of contents pn program 
under our pn program  we have completed formulation development and clinical studies for several combinations of a ppi and a nsaid in a single tablet intended to provide effective management of pain and inflammation associated with chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis  and intended to have fewer gastrointestinal complications compared to a nsaid taken alone in patients at risk for developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers 
we initially conducted studies with two pn product formulations in this program pn  a combination of the ppi lansoprazole and the nsaid naproxen  and pn  a combination of the ppi omeprazole and naproxen  prior to entering into our collaboration with astrazeneca 
our present development and commercialization efforts under the pn program are covered under our exclusive collaboration agreement with astrazeneca  which we entered into on august  and which was amended in september and october under our agreement with astrazeneca  we are co developing with astrazeneca  and astrazeneca will commercialize  proprietary fixed dose combinations of the ppi esomeprazole magnesium with the nsaid naproxen in a single tablet 
the initial product to be developed under the agreement  pn  is being studied for the management of pain and inflammation associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in patients who are at risk for developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers 
on march   we filed an ind with the fda for pn and in april  the first phase study was initiated 
in discussions with the fda during regarding our development plans for studies to pursue fda approval of pn and pn  the fda agreed that by including naproxen as the nsaid within the pn formulation  we could expect that all indications for chronic use of naproxen in adults would accrue to the pn product  if clinical trials successfully demonstrated improved safety lower incidence of gastric ulcers of the pn product compared with naproxen alone and the pn formulation was shown to be bioequivalent to marketed formulations of enteric coated  or ec  naproxen 
prior to entering into our collaboration agreement with astrazeneca  we completed a study designed to demonstrate the bioequivalence of the naproxen component of our pn product candidate development formulation to ec naproxen 
this study demonstrated that the pn product was bioequivalent to the reference drug  ec naprosyn  with respect to the naproxen component 
in early  we submitted a spa to the fda for our pivotal phase clinical trials for pn the spa is a process in which the fda provides evaluations and guidance on clinical trial protocols for pivotal phase clinical trials 
in april  we announced that we had reached an agreement with the fda on the phase pivotal clinical trials for pn for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis  rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in patients at risk of developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers 
we also reached agreement with the fda that the development program and study design proposed for pn would be applicable to a product that contained an isomer of omeprazole combined with naproxen 
in light of our collaboration agreement with astrazeneca  we  along with astrazeneca have met with the fda and confirmed the core development program and the principles in the spa already agreed upon do apply to the new product consisting of proprietary fixed dose combinations of esomeprazole magnesium with naproxen 
in the third quarter of  we began recruiting subjects for a six month comparative trial of pn as compared to ec naproxen in patients requiring chronic nsaid therapy 
the primary endpoint for the trial was the cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers over six months of treatment 
because we did not have final results until the fourth quarter of  we  together with astrazeneca reviewed the interim results of this trial prior to commencing phase studies of pn in september this study has now been completed and the results which have been presented publicly  indicated significantly fewer endoscopically confirmed gastric ulcers during the six month treatment period in subjects on pn compared to subjects receiving enteric coated naproxen alone 
we have completed two pn phase pivotal trials in patients who are at risk for developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers  the primary endpoint for which is the reduction in endoscopic gastric ulcers 
in october  the fda informed us that it was conducting an internal review of the acceptability of using endoscopic gastric ulcers as a primary endpoint in clinical trials 
in late january  the fda informed us that it had completed its internal discussions and that there was no change to previous agreements that gastric ulcer incidence was an acceptable primary endpoint for our clinical programs 
the two pivotal trials have been completed and met their primary endpoints 
in both trials  patients taking pn experienced significantly fewer endoscopically confirmed gastric ulcers compared to subjects receiving enteric coated naproxen during the six month treatment period 
in addition  we are conducting a long term  open label safety study for pn we have terminated a non pivotal smaller study in patients at high risk ie  previous bleeding from a gastric ulcer of gastrointestinal related events from nsaids which is not required for approval 
we are also conducting additional studies at astrazeneca s expense 
in  we also had discussions with the fda concerning the implications of the fda s guidance issued in june concerning labeling of nsaid containing products  which resulted from an fda advisory committee meeting held in february the advisory committee addressed the safety of nsaids  and  in particular  the cardiovascular risks of cox selective nsaids 
based on our discussions with the fda reviewing division for pn products  we believe that  unless new information about naproxen safety concerns becomes available  long term cardiovascular safety studies will not be required at this time for fda approval of our pn product candidates containing naproxen 
however  we cannot guarantee that such studies will not be required 
we will continue to evaluate and review with the fda its expectations and recommendations regarding the efficacy and safety requirements and study design necessary to support approval of ndas for our pn product candidates 

table of contents additionally  we have met with four national european regulatory agencies to discuss the proposed development program for pn 
under our agreement with astrazeneca  astrazeneca has responsibility for the development program for pn outside the us  including interactions with regulatory agencies 
it is our understanding that astrazeneca intends to file marketing applications for pn in certain ex us countries based upon clinical data being generated for the nda soon after the nda is filed 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the amount or timing of the costs necessary to obtain regulatory approval of pn nor can we reasonably estimate or know the amount or timing of the costs necessary to continue exploratory development and or complete the development of any pn product candidates we may seek to develop or when  if and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from any pn products 
the additional costs that may be incurred include expenses relating to clinical trials and other research and development activities and activities necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
we incurred direct development costs associated with the development of our pn program of million for the fiscal year ended december   million of which was funded by development revenue from astrazeneca 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
pa program 
as part of our pa program  we are exploring the development of a combination of a ppi and aspirin in a single tablet 
similar to the pn program  our pa product candidate is intended to induce fewer gastrointestinal complications compared to an aspirin taken alone in patients at risk for developing aspirin associated gastric ulcers 
our pa product candidates are covered under the same patent as pn  but we have retained all rights to this program 
our initial pa product candidate  pa  is currently in early stage clinical development 
we completed a phase proof of concept study in canada of an earlier formulation of pa containing mg of aspirin and mg of omeprazole pa in the first quarter of the primary endpoint was gastrointestinal damage as measured by the lanza scoring system used in our previous pn studies 
the results were highly significant p with percent of the pa group having lanza or gastrointestinal damage  whereas of the ec aspirin group had this level of gastrointestinal damage during the day study 
we also completed a second proof of concept study with pa as compared to mg of ec aspirin 
these results confirmed the earlier levels of gastric damage as measured by lanza scoring at about for pa while these results in the second study were numerically different between treatment groups  they did not achieve statistical significance from the results obtained with mg ec aspirin 
after reviewing these data  we decided to increase the dose of omeprazole to mg per tablet and conduct an additional day phase study using the formulation containing mg of immediate release of omeprazole and mg of aspirin pa compared to mg ec aspirin 
topline results from this study indicate a highly significant p reduction in gastrointestinal damage with the higher strength pa tablet as compared with mg ec aspirin vs 
grade or lanza scores  respectively 
in this last study  of subjects treated with the pa tablet showed no gastrointestinal damage at all as compared to with the pa tablet 
an ind for the product was filed in the fourth quarter of and we met with the fda in july to discuss the overall development program requirements 
we completed a study which demonstrated that the salicylic acid component of pa was bioequivalent to the reference drug  ec aspirin  with respect to the aspirin component  and which we believe will allow our pa product to receive all the cardio and cerebrovascular secondary prevention claims of aspirin 
in june  we filed an spa with the fda for our pivotal phase trials for pa  the primary endpoint for which is the reduction in endoscopic gastric ulcers 
the spa is a process by which the fda and a company reach agreement on the phase pivotal trial protocol design  clinical endpoints and statistical analyses that are acceptable to support regulatory approval 
in october  the fda informed us that it was conducting an internal review of the acceptability of using endoscopic gastric ulcers as a primary endpoint in clinical trials 
in late january  fda informed us that it had completed its internal discussions and that there was no change to previous agreements that gastric ulcer incidence was an acceptable primary endpoint for our clinical programs and in february  we received written confirmation from fda that endoscopic gastric ulcer incidence was an acceptable endpoint for the phase clinical studies we proposed in our spa for pa we are also conducting both formulation development and early stage clinical studies with other pa product candidates for indications in addition to cardiovascular protection 
additionally  we have met with three national european regulatory agencies to discuss the proposed development program for pa 
each of these regulatory agencies has indicated that reduction in gastric ulcers is an appropriate endpoint for the pivotal trials  along with demonstrating bioequivalence to the reference drug  ec aspirin  with respect to the aspirin component 
dose ranging studies may also be required 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the amount or timing of the costs necessary to continue exploratory development and or complete the development of any pa product candidates we may seek to develop or when  if and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from any pa products 
the additional costs that may be incurred include expenses relating to clinical trials and other research and development activities and activities necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 

table of contents we incurred direct development costs associated with the development of our pa program of million during the fiscal year ended december  our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
mt in october  we received a not approvable letter from the fda related to our nda for mt  which we had submitted in december we are not currently conducting any clinical trials for mt and do not expect to incur any additional significant development costs related to mt  nor do we believe that we will receive any future cash inflows from mt we incurred million direct development costs associated with the development of mt for the fiscal year ended december  our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
in july  we received a letter from valeant na  seeking payment of a million withdrawal fee required under certain conditions under the agreement 
we do not believe that the withdrawal fee is payable under the circumstances of receipt of the not approvable letter from the fda 
the agreement requires that unresolved disputes by the parties be referred to the respective chief executive officers for resolution 
if still unresolved  the agreement provides for binding arbitration 
valeant na has disputed our conclusion that the withdrawal fee is not payable and has indicated its intention to pursue the dispute resolution provisions provided for under the agreement  although the last written communication from valeant na was received in march in  based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances  we recognized the remaining million licensing fee for mt we can give no assurance that valeant na will agree to termination terms acceptable to us  or that we will not be required to pay valeant na the withdrawal fee described above 
critical accounting policies and estimates management makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the us in the preparation of our financial statements 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  and the related disclosure about these policies  have been reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we have historically discussed and continue to discuss three critical accounting estimates revenue recognition  accrued expenses and income taxes 
revenue recognition we record revenue under two categories licensing revenues and development revenues 
with regard to the licensing revenues  the licensing and other collaborative agreements have terms that include up front payments upon contract signing  additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product s development are reached  royalty payments based on future product sales and withdrawal fees if certain conditions are met 
we recognize revenue under these agreements in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition as amended by sab revenue recognition sab  and emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under sab recognition of revenue from non refundable up front payments is deferred by us upon receipt and recognized over the period ending on the anticipated dates of regulatory approvals  as specified in the agreements relating to the product candidates 
if regulatory approvals or other events relating to our product candidates are accelerated  delayed or not ultimately obtained  then the amortization of revenues for these products would prospectively be accelerated or reduced accordingly 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon the achievement of specified milestones if i the milestone is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and ii the fees are non refundable 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue and only recognized as revenue when both criteria are met 

table of contents treximet royalty revenue is recognized when earned as will future royalty revenues with respect to the manufacture  sale or use of our products or technology 
for treximet or those future arrangements where royalties are reasonably estimable  we recognize revenue based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and reflect in future revenue any differences between the estimated and actual royalties 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of royalty revenue which is included within licensing revenue in the accompanying statements of operations 
with regard to the development revenues  our licensing agreements may include payment for services provided by us on an hourly rate and direct expense basis 
we record such revenue in accordance with the agreements which would generally be based upon time spent and materials used on the project 
in accordance with eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  under the astrazeneca and gsk agreements  we will recognize as revenue the direct costs and certain personnel related expense incurred in performing additional development activities described within the related agreement 
management believes that its current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate the periods for revenue recognition described above are appropriate  and historical changes in our estimates of these periods have not resulted in material changes in the revenue we recognized 
however  we continually review these estimates  which could result in a change in the deferral period and might impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
further  if regulatory approval for treximet is accelerated  delayed or not ultimately obtained  then the amortization of revenues for this product would prospectively be accelerated or reduced accordingly 
as of december   we had deferred revenue on our balance sheet totaling million 
the current portion of deferred revenue  totaling million  is expected to be earned in the next twelve months 
we recognized licensing revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   and million for the fiscal year ended december  of the licensing revenue we recognized million in milestone revenue related to the approval of  and gsk s intent to commercialize  treximet and million in royalty revenue during the fiscal year ended december  a million milestone payment from astrazeneca for the pn program was recognized in the fiscal year ended december  we recognized development revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   and million for the fiscal year ended december  there was no milestone revenue recognized for the fiscal year ended december  accrued expenses  including contracted costs significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with accrued expenses  including those related to contract costs  such as costs associated with our clinical trials 
specifically  our management must make estimates of costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced in relation to contracted  external costs 
management analyzes the progress of product development  clinical trial and toxicology and related activities  invoices received and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability for these related costs 
material differences in the amount and timing of the accrued liability for any period may result if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our management believes that its current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate accrued expenses for the period are appropriate 
however  determining the date on which certain contract services commence  the extent of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services involves subjective judgments and estimates and often must be based upon information provided by third parties 
in the event that we do not identify certain contract costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the extent of services performed or the costs of such services  we adjust our annuals during the period in which the information becomes available 
accrued costs related to product development and operating activities  including clinical trials  based upon the progress of these activities covered by the related contracts  invoices received and estimated costs totaled million at december  and million at december  the variance  at each of these ending periods  between the actual expenses incurred and the estimated expenses accrued has been less than  
table of contents stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires us to account for share based payment transactions using a fair value based method and recognize the related expense in our results of operations 
prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r  as permitted by sfas no 
 we accounted for share based payments to employees using the accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  intrinsic value method 
therefore  prior to january  we generally recognized compensation expense for restricted stock awards and did not recognize compensation cost for employee stock options  as all such options had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
sfas no 
r allows companies to choose one of two transition methods the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
we chose to use the modified prospective transition methodology 
under this transition method  our compensation cost recognized includes compensation costs for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
accordingly  we have not restated our financial results for prior periods 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
consistent with the valuation method we used for disclosure only purposes under the provisions of sfas no 
 we use the black scholes model to value service condition and performance condition option awards under sfas no 
r 
for awards with only service conditions and graded vesting features  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
for awards with performance or market conditions granted subsequent to our adoption of sfas no 
r  we intend to recognize compensation cost over the expected period to achieve the performance or market condition  provided achievement of the performance condition is deemed probable 
determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected terms 
our expected volatility rate was estimated based on an equal weighting of the historical volatility of our common stock over a six year period 
the expected term we use was estimated based on average historical terms to exercise 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on seven year us treasury securities 
the pre vesting forfeiture rate used for the year ended december  was based on actual historical rates 
determining the appropriate amount to expense for performance based awards based on the achievement of stated goals requires judgment  including forecasting future performance results 
the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate 
the cumulative impact of any revisions is reflected in the period of change 
if any applicable financial performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
fair value measurement on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas fair value measurements sfas 
sfas was issued in september and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb released fsp no 
fas which deferred the effective date of sfas for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
it did not defer recognition and disclosure requirements for financial assets and financial liabilities or for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are remeasured at least annually 
accordingly  as of january   we have applied the provisions of sfas only to financial assets and liabilities as discussed below 
our adoption of sfas did not result in our recording any cumulative effect adjustments to retained earnings 
under sfas  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in determining fair value  we use various valuation approaches  including quoted market prices and discounted cash flows 
sfas no 
also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect a company s judgment concerning the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available under the circumstances 
the fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that the company is able to access 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment 
level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar  or quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar instruments  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
the financial assets for which we perform recurring remeasurements are cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of december   financial assets utilizing level inputs included cash equivalents and short term investments 
financial assets utilizing level inputs included short term investments in government agency obligations and corporate fixed income securities 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  our own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
we use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date  including during periods of market dislocation  such as the recent illiquidity in the auction rate securities market 
in periods of market dislocation  the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments 
this condition has caused  and in the future may cause  our financial instruments to be reclassified from level to level or from level to level sfas requires that the valuation techniques used by us are consistent with at least one of the three possible approaches the market approach  income approach  and or cost approach 
our level valuations are based on the market approach and consist primarily of quoted prices for identical items on active securities exchanges 
our level valuations also use the market approach and are based on significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices for financial instruments not traded on a daily basis 
we did not rely on level input for valuation of our securities at december  income taxes we estimate an annual effective tax rate of for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was for the twelve month period ended december  however  the actual effective rate may vary depending upon actual licensing fees and milestone payments received  specifically the pre tax book income for the year  and other factors 
income taxes have been accounted for using the liability method in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and may incur substantial and recurring losses in future periods 
the tax reform act of the act provides for a limitation on the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry forwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the act that could limit our ability to utilize these carry forwards 
we have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the act  as a result of  among other reasons  past financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carry forwards may be limited 
additionally  because tax laws limit the time during which these carry forwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes 
we currently file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and the state of north carolina 
we are no longer subject to federal or north carolina income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before however  the loss carryforwards generated prior to may still be subject to change  if we subsequently begin utilizing these losses in a year that is open under statute and subject to federal or north carolina income tax examinations by tax authorities

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable 
sfas also requires expanded disclosure to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
sfas was adopted effective january  in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas gives companies the irrevocable option to carry most financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
sfas was adopted effective january  in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb released fsp no 
fas which deferred the effective date of sfas for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
it did not defer recognition and disclosure requirements for financial assets and financial liabilities or for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are remeasured at least annually 
accordingly  as of january   we have applied the provisions of sfas only to financial assets and liabilities 
our adoption of sfas did not result in our recording any cumulative effect adjustments to retained earnings 
in june  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf on eitf issue no 
 accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf requires companies to defer and capitalize prepaid  nonrefundable research and development payments to third parties  and amortize them over the period that the research and development activities are performed or the services are provided  subject to an assessment of recoverability 
eitf is effective for new contracts entered into during fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted eitf effective january  item a

under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a decrease in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio
