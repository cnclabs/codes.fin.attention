item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item of this annual report 
in addition to the historical information  the discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements due to applications of our critical accounting policies and factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under the caption risk factors in item a of part i of this annual report 
executive summary overview we offer outsourcing services to national and regional financial institutions and educational institutions for designing and implementing private education loan programs 
these private education loan programs are designed to be marketed to prospective student borrowers and their families directly or through educational institutions and to generate portfolios intended to be held by the originating lender or financed in the capital markets 
in addition  we provide administrative and other services to securitization trusts that we have facilitated  asset servicing to the third party owner of certain securitization trusts and portfolio management services to a limited number of clients 
we offer prospective clients the opportunity to outsource key components of their private education loan programs to us by providing a fully integrated suite of services  including our new monogram product offering that allows clients to meet their desired risk control and return objectives 
in addition  we offer the following services on a stand alone  fee for service basis loan origination we provide loan processing services to schools and lenders  from application intake through loan disbursement 
we customize our services to meet the specific branding  pricing and underwriting requirements of our clients 
portfolio management we manage private education loan portfolios on behalf of their owners by employing risk analytics to monitor and manage the performance of the portfolio over time 
as part of this service offering  we monitor portfolio performance metrics  work with our clients to manage the performance of third party vendors and interface with rating agencies 
our infrastructure provides us with data that enables robust analytics  and we are able to customize collections strategies as needed to optimize loan performance 
trust administration as administrator for securitization trusts that we facilitated  we monitor the performance of the loan servicers and third party collection agencies  including ensuring compliance with the servicing guidelines and review of default prevention and collections activities 
in this capacity  we are responsible for reconciliation of funds among the third parties and the trusts 
we also provide regular reporting to investors in the abs issued by the trusts and other parties related to the trusts 
asset servicing our experience enables us to offer asset servicing such as residual analysis and valuation optimization services and strategies relating to asset funding 
additional services from time to time  we may offer other services as needs arise  including services relating to loan marketing and loan financing 
we also provide banking services such as residential and commercial mortgage loans  retail savings products  time deposit products and money market accounts through our subsidiary union federal  which is a federally chartered thrift regulated by the ots 
in the past  union federal has also offered private education loans directly to consumers 

table of contents during fiscal  we took several measures to adjust our business model in light of economic conditions 
most significantly  we refined our product offerings in an effort to attract lenders and educational institutions back into the market for private education loans 
we also added fee for service offerings such as portfolio management and asset servicing 
we also revised our fee structures  made major changes in senior management and significantly reduced our operating expenses 
our new monogram product offering has been designed to strengthen the value of the resulting loan assets  through redesigned risk based pricing  enhanced cosigner participation  and by aligning risk and product options to the specific credit profile of the student borrower and their cosigner 
additionally  given the current market conditions  we would anticipate originating a greater proportion of immediate repayment loans  or loans for which payment of principal and interest begins shortly after final disbursement  and interest only loans  or loans for which payment of interest begins shortly after disbursement but payment of principal is deferred during enrollment 
the success of the new product will be critical to growing and diversifying our revenues and client base 
in light of regulatory constraints  however  union federal is not expected to participate as a program lender during fiscal we also changed our fee structure with respect to our services and have developed additional services that would provide us with fee based income as our services are provided 
the revised fee structure is intended to improve our cash flow and reduce our dependence on the credit and capital markets and on any single guarantor or other credit enhancement provider 
significant uncertainty exists regarding the success or market acceptance of our new products and services and our ability to access the securitization markets 
nonetheless  we believe our new strategies combined with our capital  experience and industry knowledge should position us to compete effectively in a re emerging private education loan marketplace 
the historical driver of our results of operations and financial condition has been the volume of private education loans for which we provided outsourcing services from loan origination through securitization 
asset backed securitizations have historically been our sole source of permanent financing for our clients private education loan programs  and substantially all of our income has been derived from securitizations 
securitization refers to the technique of pooling loans and selling them to a special purpose  bankruptcy remote entity  typically a trust  which issues bonds backed by those loans to investors 
in the past  we offered our clients a fully integrated suite of outsourcing services  but we did not charge separate fees for many of those services 
although we provided those various services without charging a separate fee  or at cost in the case of loan processing services  we generally entered into agreements with the lender clients giving us the exclusive right to securitize the private education loans that they did not intend to hold 
for our past securitization services  we have been entitled to receive from the trusts up front structural advisory fees  additional structural advisory fees over time and residual cash flows 
we have been unable to access the securitization market since september as a result of market disruptions that began in the second quarter of fiscal  accelerated during the third quarter of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  persist as of september  in addition  our lender clients previously had the opportunity to mitigate their credit risk through a loan repayment guaranty by teri  and we historically received reimbursement from teri for outsourced loan processing services we performed on teri s behalf 
in april  teri filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
the teri reorganization  together with capital markets dislocations  has had  and will likely continue to have  a material negative effect on our client relationships  facilitated loan volumes  our ability to structure loan securitizations  the value of our service receivables and our ability to realize fully the cost reimbursement and guaranty obligations of teri 
during fiscal  we facilitated loans with an aggregate principal balance of million and received million in processing fees from teri 
in contrast  during fiscal  we facilitated loans 
table of contents with an aggregate principal balance of billion and received million in processing fees from teri 
we do not expect to receive processing fees from teri in the future 
in addition  credit performance of consumer related loans generally  and the private education loans held by us and the various securitization trusts we have facilitated  have been adversely affected by general economic conditions in the united states  including increasing unemployment rates and reduced availability of consumer credit 
during fiscal  we increased the projected weighted average gross default rates for the ncslt trusts by basis points to and credit rating agencies took negative rating actions with respect to those trusts  resulting in write downs of our service receivables 
the portfolio of private education loans held by us has experienced a higher level of defaults than we originally projected 
the interest rate  economic and credit environments may continue to have a material negative effect on the estimated value of our service receivables and loans held for sale 
we recorded losses during fiscal of million in connection with write downs of the loans to their estimated fair value 
in addition  we have committed to the ots to reduce the level of private education loans held by union federal by december   which could result in the sale or other disposition of such education loans at a significant loss 
we remain focused on preserving capital and maximizing liquidity in these challenging market conditions 
during fiscal  we received million in gross proceeds from an equity financing  and we greatly reduced our annual cash expenditure requirements through reductions in headcount  consolidation of office space and other cost saving initiatives that began in fiscal in addition  as of march   we sold the trust certificate  which represented our residual interests in substantially all of the teri guaranteed private education loans that we had previously securitized 
as a result of this transaction  we expect to generate a refund for income taxes previously paid and eliminate certain of our future tax liabilities  which would have had a material negative effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
also  we are no longer entitled to receive residual cash flows from the ncslt trusts  which represented substantially all of our residuals receivables  however  we continue to have rights to additional structural advisory fees and will earn asset servicing fees from the ncslt trusts  as well as additional structural advisory fees and residuals from certain trusts other than the ncslt trusts 
business trends and uncertainties beginning in late and continuing through the date of this annual report  general economic conditions in the united states have deteriorated 
credit performance of consumer related loans generally  and the private education loans held by us and the various securitization trusts that we have facilitated  have been adversely affected and are continuing to deteriorate 
in the broader markets  the current conditions have remained challenging  as a result of increasing unemployment rates  the lack of available consumer credit  securitization market disruptions and capital constraints and reluctance by lenders to participate in the private education loan market 
changes in any of the following factors have materially affected  and may continue to materially affect  our financial results the private education loan securitization market  including the costs or availability of financing  including the impact of government efforts such as the talf  and market receptivity to private education loan asset backed notes and auction rate notes  including notes backed by direct to consumer private education loans  regulatory requirements applicable to union federal and us  including the supervisory agreement and the order  which require  among other things  a reduction in the level of private education loans union federal holds by december  and maintenance by fmc of union federal s regulatory capital ratios at specified levels  and which prevents union federal from funding additional private education loans  
table of contents valuation adjustments relating to union federal s portfolio of private education loans held for sale  our ability to recover federal income taxes previously paid on certain of our residuals receivables  the demand for private education financing  which may be affected by limitations established by the federal government on the amount of federal loans that a student can receive  the terms and eligibility criteria for loans under the federal government s plus loan program and legislation recently passed or under consideration as of september   the market acceptance of our monogram product offering and our fee for service offerings  the competition for providing private education financing and reluctance by lenders to participate in the private education loan market  the general interest rate and consumer credit environments  including their effect on our assumed discount  net default and prepayment rates and the trusts ability to recover principal and interest from borrowers  our critical accounting policies and estimates  applicable laws and regulations  which may affect the terms upon which lenders agree to make private education loans  recovery rates on defaulted education loans and the cost and complexity of our loan facilitation operations  developments in connection with the teri reorganization  including approval of any plan of reorganization proposed by teri or the creditors committee  and actions taken by rating agencies  including changes to transaction assumptions  ratings actions on outstanding securitization transactions and or modifications of credit enhancement levels 
dislocations in the debt capital markets persisted throughout fiscal  and we did not complete a securitization transaction during the period 
in addition  rating agencies have expressed concerns that direct to consumer loans will experience higher levels of defaults than school channel loans 
a significant portion of the loans that we have facilitated for clients in the past  and all of our private education loans held for sale  are direct to consumer loans 
we believe  however  that conditions in capital markets have begun to improve during the first quarter of fiscal  including additional issuances of private education loan abs pursuant to the talf program 
if we are able to facilitate the securitization of private education loans in the future  we expect the structure and economics of such a transaction to be substantially different from our past transactions 
we expect lower revenues and additional cash requirements on our part and limited  if any  demand for subordinate tranches of abs 
we have pursued alternative means to finance our clients loans and our loans held for sale  but other sources of funding have not been available to us 
in july  we entered into the supervisory agreement with the ots  and union federal consented to the issuance by the ots to union federal of the order 
among other things  we agreed to reduce the level of private education loans held by union federal by december   and we agreed to submit to the ots a new business plan for union federal covering fiscal years  and we are uncertain whether we will be able to dispose of union federal s loan portfolio on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  we are uncertain whether the ots will approve the strategy and business activities that we propose for union federal  including the extent to which union federal will be permitted to originate private education loans 
see note  subsequent events supervisory agreement and order to cease and desist  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report for additional details 
although we intend to take such actions as may be necessary to enable us to comply with the supervisory agreement and the order  we 
table of contents cannot assure you that we will be able to comply fully  or do so within the timeframes required 
moreover  compliance with the requirements may be more time consuming or more expensive than we anticipate  and efforts to comply with such requirements may have adverse effects on our operations and financial condition 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  such as those involving recognition of service revenues and the valuation of our service receivables and portfolio of private education loans held for sale 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements to be a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that our estimates relating to the recognition and valuation of our securitization related revenue and receivables and asset servicing revenue and receivables  as described below  fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
we also consider our policy with respect to the determination of whether or not to consolidate the financial results of the securitization trusts that we facilitate and the valuation of the portfolio of private education loans held by union federal to be critical accounting policies 
service revenue and receivables we have historically structured and facilitated securitization transactions for our clients through a series of bankruptcy remote  special purpose statutory trusts 
through the securitization process  the trusts obtain private education loans from the originating lenders or their assignees  which relinquish to the trust their ownership interest in the loans 
the debt instruments that the trusts issue to finance the purchase of these private education loans are obligations of the trusts  rather than our obligations or those of originating lenders or their assignees 
we have received several types of fees in connection with our past securitization services up front structural advisory fees 
we received a portion of the structural advisory fees at the time the securitization trust purchased the loans 
additional structural advisory fees 
we are entitled to receive a portion of the structural advisory fees over time  based on the amount of loans outstanding in the trust from time to time over the life of the trust 

table of contents asset servicing fees 
for nclst trusts for which we were previously entitled to receive a portion of the residual interests  we are now entitled to receive asset servicing fees based on services we are contractually obligated to perform on behalf of the new residual interest owners 
receipt of such fees is contingent upon distributions available to the owners of the residual interests of such trusts 
see note  sale of trust certificate and related transactions  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report for additional details 
residuals 
we also have the right to receive a portion of the residual interests  if any  generated by various securitization trusts other than the ncslt trusts 
this right is junior in priority to the rights of the holders of the debt sold in the securitizations and additional structural advisory fees 
as required under gaap  we recognize the fair value of additional structural advisory fees and residuals as revenue at the time the securitization trust purchases the private education loans  as they are deemed to be earned at the time of the securitization but before we actually receive payment 
these amounts are deemed earned because evidence of an arrangement exists  we have provided the services  the fee is fixed and determinable based upon a discounted cash flow analysis  there are no future contingencies or obligations and collection is reasonably assured 
for asset servicing fees  we earn additional fees as the services are performed  however  the receipt of the fees is contingent on distributions available to the owners of the residual interests of the trusts subject to these services 
under gaap  we are required to estimate the fair value of the additional structural advisory fees  asset servicing fees and residuals receivables as if they are investments in securities classified as trading  similar to retained interests in securitizations 
in subsequent periods  we reevaluate the estimated fair value of these receivables and recognize the change in fair value as servicing revenue in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
because there are no quoted market prices for our additional structural advisory fees  asset servicing fees  residuals receivables or private education loans held for sale  we use discounted cash flow modeling techniques and the following key assumptions to estimate their values expected annual rate and timing of loan defaults  and teri s obligation and ability to pay default claims  if applicable  expected recoveries of defaulted loans  including recoveries to replenish trusts pledged accounts  the annual rate and timing of private education loan prepayments  the discount rate  which we use to calculate the present value of our future cash flows  the trend of interest rates over the life of the loan pool  including the forward libor curve and the spread between libor and auction rates  if applicable  fees and expenses of the securitization trusts  and in the case of private education loans held for sale  the proportion of equity to financing and borrowing costs and a buyer s expected rate of return 
we base our estimates on our proprietary historical data  publicly available third party data and our industry experience  adjusting for specific product and borrower characteristics such as loan type and borrower creditworthiness 
we also monitor trends in loan performance over time and make adjustments we believe are necessary to value properly our receivables balances and private education loans at each balance sheet date 
at june  and  the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the debt issued by the ncslt trusts was billion and billion  respectively 
the underlying assets in the ncslt 
table of contents trusts were teri guaranteed private education loans  of which approximately were in deferment  were in forbearance and were in repayment status as of june  approximately of the loans in repayment status as of june  were current  were between and days past due  were between and days past due  and were greater than days past due 
as of june   the cumulative gross default rate with regard to loans in  and loans that have previously been in  repayment status was for the aggregate loans in the ncslt trusts 
we have posted to our website  and filed as exhibit to this annual report  static pool data as of june   including actual borrower payment status  delinquency  cumulative loss and prepayment data as of june  for certain securitization trusts that we have facilitated 
we have also posted to our website  and filed as exhibit to this annual report  a supplemental presentation of certain historical trust performance data  including channel specific loans available for securitization by fiscal quarter  parity ratios by trust  net recovery rates by trust  fico score rates by year of origination and by channel  payment status by trust and six month rolling prepayment rates by trust 
because our fair value estimates rely on quantitative and qualitative factors  including historical data and macroeconomic indicators to predict prepayment  default and recovery rates  management s ability to determine which factors should be more heavily weighted in our estimates  and our ability to accurately incorporate those factors into our loan performance assumptions  can have a material effect on our valuations 
default and recovery rates 
the net default rate is calculated as the weighted average for all of our private education loan securitization trusts of the estimated cumulative principal balance  including capitalized interest and fees  of defaulted private education loans over the life of a trust  which we refer to as the endpoint default  minus the estimated net cumulative amount of recoveries reduced by costs of recovery on defaulted loans over the life of the trust  divided by the original principal balance of the loans 
a securitization trust may have a life of over years  based on a lifecycle for private education loans that includes borrowers in school deferment  grace  repayment and forbearance periods 
higher levels of loan defaults are generally expected to occur in the early years of a trust  as loans enter repayment 
recoveries on defaulted loans are expected to lag defaults by months or years  with cumulative recoveries increasing gradually over an extended period of time later in the life of a trust 
as a result  at a single point in time  particularly early in the life of a trust  a trust may experience an actual net default rate that is higher than the estimated endpoint net default rate for that trust 
for the same reason  we assess the actual current net default rates against an expected default timing curve  which reflects the expected speed of defaults over the life of a trust 
the shape of the default curve is based in part on our proprietary database of loan performance information  reflecting data through a variety of economic cycles  and influences the estimated endpoint defaults  which in turn influence the net default rate 
prepayment rates 
we compute prepayments as the difference between the total amount of payments  both principal and interest  received from or on behalf of a borrower and the amount of principal and interest billed to the borrower during the same period 
to convert this dollar amount into a rate  we divide these amounts by the dollar amounts that could possibly have been repaid during that period and annualize the result 
this approach results in a rate that is expressed as a conditional prepayment rate  or cpr 
the cpr is essentially an estimate of the likelihood that a loan will be prepaid during a period  given that it has not previously defaulted or been prepaid in full 
the prepayment rate can be significantly different at different points in time over the life of a trust  or any pool of loans  because the prepayment rate for a given cohort of loans will vary with their seasoning  credit quality  prevailing interest rates and availability of consumer credit 

table of contents a loan in deferment is expected to have a low likelihood of being prepaid 
a loan is expected to have a higher likelihood of being prepaid during the first  compared to the second  year of repayment 
however  after the second year  as a loan becomes more seasoned  the likelihood of a prepayment is expected to increase further  as borrowers increase their earning power and their ability to partially or fully prepay their loans  or as they establish better credit 
discount rate additional structural advisory fees 
we base the discount rate that we use to estimate the fair value of our additional structural advisory fees on a spread over the year us treasury note rate 
the spread represents our estimate of the risk premium related to the additional structural advisory fees 
in developing the spreads  we primarily consider yield curves for certain composite indices for bbb and bb rated corporate bond indices with year maturities  as well as yields  including indicative yields  in the broader abs marketplace during the fiscal year 
discount rate asset servicing fees and residuals 
in determining an appropriate discount rate for valuing our asset servicing fee receivables and the remaining residual interests  we consider a number of factors  including market data made available to us on spreads on federally guaranteed loans and private education loans as well as rates used in the much broader abs market 
we also evaluate yield curves for corporate subordinated debt with maturities similar to the weighted average life of our residuals 
in developing our discount rates during fiscal  we considered  among other things  spreads in subordinate tranches of actual federal loan abs issuances and actual transactions involving other abs asset classes  as well as indicative spreads  not supported by actual transactions  in subordinate tranches of private education loan abs 
auction rate note interest rates 
prior to fiscal  we facilitated five trusts that issued auction rate notes to finance the purchase of private education loans 
interest rates for the auction rate notes are determined from time to time at auction 
we use a spread over one month libor to project the future cost of funding of the auction rate notes issued by each such trust 
the spread over libor used to estimate the future cost of funding was based on historical trends  then current market conditions or then current rates paid by the trusts 
during fiscal and fiscal  failed auctions occurred and persisted with respect to auction rate notes issued by each of the five securitization trusts 
as a result of the failed auctions  the auction rate notes bear interest at a contractual maximum spread over one month libor  based on the ratings assigned to the notes by certain rating agencies 
during fiscal  the ratings assigned to the auction rate notes were downgraded  resulting in an increase in that maximum spread 
in addition  the insurance financial strength rating assigned to ambac assurance corporation  or ambac  which provides credit enhancement for certain auction rate notes  was downgraded in fiscal  resulting in a further downgrading of the ratings assigned to certain of our auction rate notes 
we assumed at june  that all auction rate notes would continue to bear interest at their current maximum spreads until their expected maturity dates 
if auctions do not fail  but the interest rate determined pursuant to the auction procedures exceeds the maximum rate  the interest rate for the applicable interest period would be set at the maximum rate 
the amount of the excess interest would accrue as carryover interest 
a noteholder s right to receive carryover interest is superior to our additional structural advisory fees  asset servicing fees and residual interest in the applicable securitization trust 
as a result  our projected cash releases from securitization trusts that have issued auction rate notes  including the timing of receipt  could be materially adversely affected 
in estimating the fair value of our service receivables  we have assumed that no trust will accrue carryover interest 
forward libor curve 
libor is the underlying rate for most of the trusts assets and liabilities and can have a significant effect on the cash flows generated by each trust 
changes in the forward libor curve affect the principal balances of education loans held by the trusts  particularly as interest 
table of contents is capitalized during loan deferment  which affects the net interest margin that the trust generates 
in addition  certain trusts have issued a tranche of abs that bears a fixed interest rate 
a decrease in the forward libor may result in a reduced spread on the fixed interest tranche  which in turn decreases the estimated fair value of our service receivables 
significant changes to the forward libor curve can also affect the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fees and asset servicing fees  which bear interest at the rate of libor plus a spread to the extent such fees are accrued but unpaid by the trusts 
teri s obligation and ability to pay claims 
the indentures relating to the securitization trusts specify certain circumstances  which we refer to as trigger events  upon the occurrence of which payments that would otherwise be due in respect of additional structural advisory fees and residuals would instead be directed to the holders of the notes issued by the trusts until the conditions causing the trigger event cease to exist or all notes  and related interest  are paid in full 
under the indentures  a trigger event generally occurs when the cumulative gross defaults of loans held by such trust exceed a specified level 
as a result of the teri reorganization  in the third quarter of fiscal  we adjusted our assumptions to assume that amounts available to pay a trust s default claims will be limited to amounts available from the trust s pledged account  assuming that recoveries on defaulted loans would replenish such pledged account 
previously  we assumed that teri would pay default claims on a timely basis and that no default trigger event would occur 
although the overall expected cash flows generated by the trusts improved as a result of the higher priority of repayment of the notes  the expected timing of cash payments to us with respect to additional structural advisory fees and residuals was delayed  reducing their estimated fair value 
we did not adjust our assumptions regarding teri s obligation and ability to pay claims during fiscal notwithstanding the adversary complaint filed by the creditors committee challenging certain security interests and the expected rejection  in the context of a plan of reorganization  of teri s guaranty obligations to existing lenders and the ncslt trusts 
loans held for sale 
in april  union federal sold to fmc substantially all of its economic interest in a warehouse facility provided by a third party lender 
loans used to secure the education loan warehouse facility are subject to call provisions by the third party lender  therefore  we do not have the ability to hold the loans to maturity 
we also classify union federal s education loan portfolio as held for sale 
our intent is to dispose of union federal s private education loans in accordance with ots requirements 
loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
in the absence of quoted market values  we have utilized a cash flow model for estimating fair value  similar to the model used for valuing our service receivables utilizing assumptions and techniques previously described 
in addition to the relevant loan performance and interest rate assumptions described above  the model determines an estimated fair value based on the following percentage of the purchase price that is financed by debt versus buyer equity  a buyer s estimated return on equity  a lender s interest rate on the debt  gross default and recovery rates on the pool of loans  and collateral performance criteria necessary to garner talf financing 
these estimates are based on historical and third party data and our industry experience 
the extent of buyers equity versus debt is assumed to be similar to the talf margin requirement for investments of this duration 
the assumption for lenders cost of debt is based on market observations of recent securitizations of education loan portfolios that have similar characteristics to our loan portfolio 

table of contents sensitivity analysis increases in our estimates of defaults  prepayments and discount rates  as well as decreases in default recovery rates and the multi year forward estimates of libor  would have a negative effect on the value of our additional structural advisory fees as well as our asset servicing fees receivable and our loans held for sale 
private education loan prepayments include either full or partial payments by a borrower in advance of the maturity schedule specified in the credit agreement 
if amounts in the pledged accounts were unavailable to pay the trusts default claims or if recoveries on defaulted loans were not used to replenish the pledged accounts  or if net defaults increase beyond the level of expected third party reimbursement assumptions  then these changes will have an additional negative effect on the value of these assets 
libor is the reference rate for a substantial majority of the loan assets and  we believe  a reasonable index for borrowings of the trusts and loan purchaser 
we have included a sensitivity analysis in note  service receivables  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
this analysis is intended to show the sensitivity of our fair value estimates of our additional structural advisory fees to the significant inputs used in our discounted cash flow model 
the analysis presents our loan performance and discount rate assumptions at june  and changes to the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fees as of june  that would result from changes in our assumptions 
see note  under the heading service receivables  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report for additional information 
consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the first marblehead corporation and its subsidiaries  after eliminating inter company accounts and transactions 
we have not consolidated the financial results of the securitization trusts purchasing loans that we have facilitated 
at june  and  each of the securitization trusts created after january  has met the criteria to be a qualified special purpose entity  or qspe  as defined by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
accordingly  we did not consolidate these existing securitization trusts in our financial statements 
in addition  the securitization trusts created prior to january  in which we hold a variable interest that could result in us being considered the primary beneficiary of such trust  have been amended in order for them to be considered qspes 
on june   fasb issued financial accounting standard  accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement  which we refer to as fas  and financial accounting standard  amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  which we refer to as fas both statements are effective beginning with our financial statements for fiscal year fas removes the concept of a qspe from fasb statement and removes the exception from applying fasb interpretation no 
revised as fasb interpretation no 
r in december  consolidation of variable interest entities  to qualifying special purpose entities 
fas amends fasb interpretation no 
r to require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 

table of contents as of september   we are evaluating the impact that adoption of these statements will have on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations years ended june   june  and june  summary the following table summarizes our results of operations for the fiscal years ended june   and fiscal years ended june  change between periods in thousands  except per share data in thousands  except per share data service revenues net interest income total revenues non interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss net income loss per share  diluted diluted average shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis  we reported a net loss per share of for fiscal  compared with a net loss per share of in fiscal the higher net loss per share for fiscal is  in part  attributable to our inability to access the securitization markets to generate new revenue 
we did not facilitate any new securitization transactions in fiscal we facilitated two securitization transactions during the first quarter of fiscal in addition  we recorded further write downs of our service receivables in fiscal due to current market conditions and the sale of the trust certificate 
we ceased providing loan processing services to teri and marketing services to many clients in fiscal  causing a significant decrease in our cost reimbursement and other fee revenues  however  the decrease in these service revenues was largely offset by a decrease in the related expenses 
in total  revenues in fiscal decreased by million from fiscal partially offsetting the decrease in revenue  total non interest expenses decreased million over the same period 
the cessation of services for teri and marketing services for other clients  combined with reductions in headcount and other cost savings initiatives  reduced non interest expenses by million during fiscal  however  the write down of our private education loans held for sale increased non interest expenses to million from million in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a net loss per share of  on a fully diluted basis  compared with net income of per share in fiscal the loss in fiscal reflected a million decrease in service revenues from the prior period coupled with a million increase in non interest expenses 
lower revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due in large part to lower securitization volumes and the write downs of the service receivables for increases in discount  prepayment and default rates  partially offset by an increase in marketing revenue 
the increase in non interest expenses in fiscal included severance costs  higher marketing and advertising expenses associated with the increase in marketing revenues  and higher liquidity fees and loan origination costs

table of contents students with various expected terms to graduation  the structure of  and prevailing market conditions at the time of  a securitization  the marketing fees which our clients earn on loans we securitize for them  and a number of other factors 
therefore  readers are cautioned that the yields above are not indicative of yields that we will be able to achieve in future securitizations 
up front structural advisory fees historically  we received up front structural advisory fees at the time a securitization trust purchased the loans 
in exchange for these fees  we structured the debt securities sold in the securitization  coordinated the attorneys  accountants  trustees  loan servicers  loan originators and other transaction participants and prepared cash flow modeling for rating agencies as needed 
we did not record any up front structural advisory fees in fiscal because we did not facilitate any securitizations during the period 
we recorded million in up front structural advisory fees in fiscal related to two securitizations of teri guaranteed loans that we facilitated during the first quarter of fiscal for the securitizations facilitated during the first quarter of fiscal  up front structural advisory fees were equal to of the aggregate principal and accrued interest of the loans securitized  down from of loans securitized during fiscal we are uncertain as of september  whether the fee structure that we have historically received will be used in any future securitization transactions 
in particular  market conditions may dictate that we reduce or forgo our up front structural advisory fee in connection with securitizations  if any  that we are able to facilitate in the near term 
in fiscal  we recorded million in up front structural advisory fees due to a higher volume of loans securitized during that period as compared to prior or subsequent periods 
in addition  the private education securitization trusts that we facilitated in fiscal issued bbb rated securities  resulting in a higher up front structural advisory fee yield compared to the securitization trusts we facilitated in fiscal  which did not issue bbb rated securities 
additional structural advisory fees we are entitled to receive additional structural advisory fees over time  based on the amount of loans outstanding in the trusts from time to time over the life of the trusts  with no further requirement for service on our part 
in the case of the ncslt trusts  this portion accumulates monthly in each trust from the date of a securitization at a rate of to basis points per year plus accrued interest on earned but unpaid fee income 
we record the net present value  or estimated fair value  of these fees as a structural advisory fee receivable on the balance sheet 
we generally become entitled to receive this additional portion  plus interest  once the ratio of assets to liabilities in the particular ncslt trust  which we refer to as the parity ratio  reaches a stipulated level  which ranges from to 
the stipulated parity ratio levels may be raised if certain trust characteristics change 
the level applicable to a particular trust is determined at the time of securitization 
actual parity ratios at june  ranged from to 
please refer to exhibit to this annual report for additional information on actual trust parity ratios as of june  additional structural advisory fees recognized in the income statement represent the change in fair value during the period in the structural advisory fee receivable  less cash received  if any 
the estimated fair value of structural advisory fee receivables is based on the net present value of the future cash flows due to us from the trusts 
to estimate the amount and timing of the cash flows of these fees  we use a discount rate and estimate the amount and timing of cash flows of each trust  taking into consideration default and recovery rates  prepayments  recoverability from third party guarantors  operating expenses of the trust and trust performance assumptions  the trend of contractual and market interest rates over the life of the loan pool  the cost of funding outstanding auction rate notes  and the probability of delays due to the existence of trigger events  which generally occur when the cumulative gross defaults of loans held by a trust exceed a specified level 
these assumptions are based on historical and third party data and our industry experience 

table of contents on a quarterly basis  we update our estimate of the fair value of our structural advisory fee receivable 
we expect  as of june   to begin to receive these fees approximately five to years after the date of a particular securitization transaction 
however  for many of the trusts  the bankruptcy filing of their loans primary guarantor  teri  and the securitization market disruptions over the last two years have constituted trigger events 
these events may significantly delay the receipt of fees 
we estimate the trend of interest rates over the life of the loan pool using an implied forward libor curve  and an assumed spread between libor and auction rates  to estimate trust cash flows 
for fiscal  we recorded losses from trust updates for additional structural advisory fees of million  compared to losses from trust updates of million for fiscal the higher losses in fiscal reflect further increases in the assumed discount rate  net default rates and auction rate notes spreads  and a decrease in the forward libor curve  and resulted in a million decrease in the fair value of the receivables during fiscal  offset in part by accretion of million for the passage of time 
fiscal service revenue also included million of revenue attributable to new securitizations 
see service revenues receivables assumptions below for a discussion of each assumption 
we recorded losses of million related to additional structural advisory fees for fiscal  a decrease of million when compared to income of million for fiscal of this decrease  million was due to lower securitization volumes and million was due to increases in the assumed discount  prepayment and default rates and a decrease in the forward libor curve  offset somewhat by accretion of million for the passage of time

we recorded the estimated fair value of these residual cash flows on our balance sheet as residuals receivables 
residual fees recognized in the income statement represent the change during the period in the estimated fair value of residuals receivable 
the estimated fair value is based on the net present value of the future cash flows due to us from the trusts related to our residual interest ownerships 

table of contents during fiscal  we recorded losses on residuals receivables of million  compared with losses of million in fiscal and income of million in fiscal the losses in fiscal reflect our inability to access the securitization markets to generate new revenue and our write off of residuals receivables related to the sale of the trust certificate of nc residuals owners trust  which held substantially all of the teri guaranteed loans facilitated by us 
we sold the trust certificate effective march  under the terms of the sale  we are no longer entitled to receive any amounts related to the residual interests in these trusts 
at the time of the sale  we reduced our residuals receivables by million  in addition to net write downs of million recorded prior to the sale for changes in assumptions regarding discount rates  prepayment rates  net default rates and auction rate notes spread prior to the sale and fourth quarter adjustments to residuals of trusts not part of the sale 
see service revenues receivables assumptions below for a discussion of each assumption 
we continue to have the right to receive a portion of the residual interests  if any  generated by various securitization trusts other than the ncslt trusts 
this right is junior in priority to the rights of the holders of the debt sold in the securitizations and additional structural advisory fees 
losses in fiscal included write downs of million partially offset by million generated by two securitizations 
the write downs in fiscal reflected teri s inability to pay claims  increases in the assumed discount  default and prepayment rates  increases in the spread on auction rate notes and a decrease in the forward libor curve 
in fiscal  additions from new securitizations were higher  consistent with the higher level of loans securitized  and adverse changes in assumptions had less effect on the estimated fair value of our residuals receivables 
we entered into the asset services agreement with the purchaser of the trust certificate and vcg securities  llc  pursuant to which we have agreed to provide certain services to the purchaser to support its ownership of the ncslt trust residuals  including  among others  analysis and valuation optimization services and services relating to funding strategy 
we are entitled to asset servicing fees for these services to the extent that amounts payable to the holder of the ncslt trust residuals are paid from distributions made by each of the ncslt trusts on each payment date 
see note  sale of trust certificate and related transactions  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional details 
during fiscal  we recorded million in asset servicing fees as the net present value of our receivable under the asset services agreement

during fiscal  we increased the discount rate spread over the year us treasury note rate by basis points  to basis points 
in increasing the discount rate  we considered  among other things  overall significant widening in spreads in the abs marketplace  as well as increases in indicative spreads on subordinate private education loan securities 
the year us treasury note rate decreased by basis points during the same period  to at june  as a result  we applied a discount rate of for purposes of estimating the fair value of the additional structural advisory fees 
the increase in the discount rate during fiscal resulted in a decrease of million in the estimated fair value of additional structural advisory fees 
during fiscal  we increased the discount rate spread over the year us treasury note from basis points to basis points 
the year us treasury note rate decreased by basis points during the same period resulting in a discount rate of up from at june   in response to the deterioration in the market for structured and corporate debt 
the effect of the increase was a million decrease in the estimated fair value during fiscal 
table of contents discount rate asset servicing fees and residuals 
at june   we used a weighted average discount rate of for purposes of estimating the fair value of our asset servicing fee receivables and the remaining residual interests on our balance sheet 
the weighted average discount rate used to estimate the fair value of residuals receivables related to the ncslt trusts at the date of sale of the trust certificate was 
these rates are up from the weighted average discount rates used at june  and of and  respectively 
the increases over the two fiscal years were in response to the deterioration of the abs market and revised assumptions about teri s ability to pay claims 
losses related to the increases in the weighted average discount rates used for residuals were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
default and recovery rates 
we increased the weighted average gross default rate assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our residuals and additional structural advisory fees receivables as a result of the trusts actual default experience and general economic pressure on all consumer asset classes over the last two fiscal years 
the weighted average gross default rate at june  was  up from at june  and at june  the increases in the weighted average gross default rate assumptions resulted in decreases in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fee receivables of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and decreases in the estimated fair value of residual receivables of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  we reduced the recovery rate from to 
in addition  we lengthened the recovery timetable we use from nine years to years as a result of changing the methodology used to determine both the endpoint as well as the timing of cash recoveries 
the decrease in the recovery rate resulted in a decrease of million in the value of our additional structural advisory fees 
our assumed weighted average net default rates were  and at june   and  respectively 
auction rate notes spread 
during fiscal and fiscal  failed auctions occurred and persisted with respect to auction rate notes issued by each of the five securitization trusts 
as a result of the failed auctions  the auction rate notes bear interest at a maximum spread over one month libor  based on the ratings assigned to the notes by certain rating agencies 
during fiscal  the ratings assigned to the auction rate notes were downgraded  resulting in an increase in the maximum spread 
in addition  the insurance financial strength rating assigned to ambac  which provides credit enhancement for certain auction rate notes  was downgraded in fiscal  resulting in a further downgrading of the ratings assigned to certain of our auction rate notes 
these events resulted in increases of to basis points on the interest rates on those auction rate notes to the maximum amount under the terms of the agreements 
we assumed at june  and that those auction rate notes would continue to bear interest at their respective maximum rates until their expected maturity dates  which resulted in a million decrease in the estimated fair value of additional structural advisory fees and million for residuals during fiscal  and a decrease of million in the estimated fair value of residuals during fiscal prepayment rates 
in response to a historically low prepayment rate  the current interest rate environment and limited availability of consumer credit  we adjusted our prepayment assumption during fiscal by extending the period during which decreased prepayments were expected to persist 
as of june   we assumed that the current prepayment rate will persist until june  and then gradually revert to historical norms during the ensuing months 
these changes resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fees receivable of million and an increase of million for residuals during fiscal during fiscal  we had anticipated a higher level of prepayments in response to actual experience which resulted in a decrease in our estimates of additional structural advisory fees and residuals of million and million  respectively 

table of contents forward libor curve 
libor is the underlying rate for most of the trusts assets and liabilities and can have a significant effect on the cash flows generated by each trust 
changes in the forward libor curve affect the principal balances of education loans held by the trusts  particularly as interest is capitalized during loan deferment  which affects the net interest margin that the trust generates 
in addition  certain trusts have issued a tranche of abs that bear a fixed interest rate 
a decrease in the forward libor curve may result in a reduced spread on the fixed interest tranche  which in turn decreases the estimated fair value of our service receivables 
significant changes to the forward libor curve can also affect the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fees  which bear interest at the rate of libor plus basis points to the extent such fees are accrued but unpaid by the trusts 
decreases in the forward libor curve resulted in decreases in the estimated fair value of additional structural advisory fees of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and decreases in the estimated fair value of residuals of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
teri s ability to pay claims 
the change in our assumptions with regard to teri s ability to pay claims resulted in a decrease of million in the estimated fair value of our residuals receivable during fiscal no changes were made to our assumptions regarding teri s ability to pay claims during fiscal processing fees from teri historically  we provided outsourcing services for teri  including loan origination  customer service  default processing  default prevention and administrative services at cost under a master servicing agreement 
we recognized teri s reimbursement of our expenses for these services as revenue 
during fiscal and fiscal  we received million and million  respectively  in processing fees from teri pursuant to a master servicing agreement 
in june  in the context of the teri reorganization  the bankruptcy court entered an order approving a motion by teri to reject the master servicing agreement effective as of may   but provided for a transition services agreement between teri and us with a term through september  as a result  our reimbursement from teri for fiscal was million  a decrease of million 
we do not expect to receive a material amount of processing fees from teri in the future 
in addition  we have filed a general unsecured claim with regard to million of processing fees from teri that were due  but unpaid  prior to the filing of teri s bankruptcy petition 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the impact of the teri reorganization  partially offset by an increase in reimbursable expenses required to process a higher volume of loans actively disbursed during fiscal compared to fiscal administrative and other fees administrative and other fees decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal administrative and other fees include trust administration fees generated from the daily management and information gathering and reporting services for parties related to securitization trusts  marketing fee reimbursements upon the securitization of certain private education loans  and in fiscal year  stand alone fee based loan origination and processing fees and loan portfolio default prevention services 
administrative and other fees decreased by million in fiscal from fiscal marketing fees decreased by million to million in fiscal due to the termination of contracts with many clients as a result of the teri reorganization 
trust administration fees remained flat at million during each of fiscal and fiscal stand alone fee based loan origination and processing fees and default prevention services  new in fiscal  were million 

table of contents during fiscal  we experienced a million increase in administrative and other fees from fiscal the increase primarily related to a million increase in reimbursed marketing expenses and marketing fees  and to a lesser extent  a million increase in trust administration fees from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of higher private education loan balances in the securitization trusts 
net interest income net interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and up from million in fiscal interest income from cash equivalents  investments and federal funds sold decreased by million 
the decrease in interest income was due primarily to sharp reductions in market rates compared to the prior year and lower volume due to the use of cash for operating expenses and taxes 
interest income from loans held for sale increased due to higher volume resulting from our inability to access the securitization markets 
interest expense decreased year over year by million  due to lower volume and rates for deposits and lower rates on borrowings under the loan warehouse facility  largely offset by higher volume for the loan warehouse facility 
during fiscal  interest income from loans held for sale increased by million over fiscal due to a higher average volume of loans held for sale as a result of our inability to access the securitization markets 
higher interest income was partially offset by higher interest expense as a result of funding required to support loan balances

we reduced headcount by employees and employees  during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of decreases in several categories of expenses 
the overall decrease in marketing coordination expense was primarily due to the termination by clients of their marketing coordination agreements  largely as a result of the teri reorganization 
the overall decrease in loan volumes reduced the need for and expenses related to external call centers  professional and consulting services  and other costs for loan origination and liquidity and guaranty fees included in other expenses 
in addition  the reduced headcount in fiscal resulted in lower occupancy and equipment costs 
general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal from fiscal primarily due to the high volume of marketing services provided in fiscal  as well as higher loan liquidity fees and loan origination expenses included in other expenses 
unrealized losses on loans held for sale 
unrealized losses on loans held for sale were million in fiscal  compared with million for fiscal and no losses for fiscal the increase during fiscal was due to increases in assumptions for the discount rate  default rate  the anticipated cost of funds and a decrease in the assumption for recoveries 
these assumptions may differ from the assumptions used for our service revenue receivables 
the default rate used for our loan portfolio is higher than that of the ncslt trusts based on borrower characteristics 
see note  loans held for sale  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report for additional information 
income tax benefit expense income tax benefit increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal and an income tax expense of million in fiscal the increase in income tax benefit was primarily the result of an increase in the amount of pre tax losses between periods 
during fiscal  our effective tax rate  or the income tax benefit as a percentage of pre tax loss  decreased to from an effective tax rate of for fiscal our effective tax rate was in fiscal the decrease in our effective tax rate between fiscal and fiscal was primarily due to our inability to utilize state net operating losses primarily in the commonwealth of massachusetts  which does not provide for a carry back or a carry forward 
the decrease in our effective tax rate between fiscal and fiscal was primarily due to the change in the relative sources of total revenues 
our up front structural advisory fees decreased and our residual revenues  which have a lower effective tax rate  were a greater proportion of our loss before taxes during fiscal as compared to fiscal 
table of contents financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we expect to fund our long term liquidity requirements through revenues from operations and through issuances of common stock  promissory notes or other securities 
we expect to assess our financing alternatives periodically and access the capital markets opportunistically 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we were to enter into a strategic arrangement with another company  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities 
any sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to further delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more aspects of our operational activities  which could harm our business 
our actual liquidity and capital funding requirements may depend on a number of factors  including the extent to which our services and products  including our new monogram product offering  gain market acceptance and remain competitive  the timing  size  structure and terms of any securitization or other funding transactions that we structure  as well as the composition of the loan pool being securitized  the timing and magnitude of income tax payments created by our service receivables and receipt of income tax receivables based on the sale of the trust certificate  the extent to which we contribute amounts to fund portfolio reserves in connection with our monogram product  regulatory capital requirements applicable to union federal see support of subsidiary bank below  the amount and timing of receipt of additional structural advisory fees  asset servicing fees and residuals  our operating and information systems needs  damages that we may owe former clients as a result of a failure to securitize their loans  the extent to which we repurchase shares of our common stock or pay cash dividends to our stockholders  and the availability of education loans or grants through federal programs 
liquidity would be required for capital expenditures  working capital  business development expenses  costs associated with alternative financing transactions  general corporate expenses  repurchases of our common stock  quarterly cash dividends and maintaining the regulatory capital of our bank subsidiary  union federal 
in order to preserve capital and maximize liquidity in challenging market conditions  we have taken four broad measures in august  we received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million from the sale of preferred stock to affiliates of gscp 
the proceeds from the sale of preferred stock significantly improved our ability to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
in march  we sold the trust certificate  which represented our residual interests in trusts holding substantially all of the teri guaranteed loans that we had previously securitized 
this disposition should result in a significant refund in fiscal of taxes previously paid  and the sale is expected to eliminate any future federal and state tax liabilities associated with the ncslt trust residuals 
however  the tax consequences of the sale are not certain 

table of contents throughout the fiscal year  we have reduced headcount and marketing coordination and operational expenses 
finally  our board of directors has eliminated regular quarterly cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock for the foreseeable future 
we had combined cash  cash equivalents  federal funds sold and investments of million and million  at june  and june   respectively 
net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal  reflecting the funding of operations 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal of million reflecting a net use of million by union federal to generate private education loans 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal of million reflected up front fees related to the higher securitization volume less funding of operations 
cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to the net reduction in federal funds sold and investments that was used to finance operating activities 
cash used by investing activities of million in fiscal and million in fiscal reflected a higher volume of investments  primarily in variable rate demand notes  and equipment purchases 
cash provided by financing activities reflected the net issuance proceeds of series b non voting convertible preferred stock of million in fiscal  largely offset by a reduction in deposit levels 
at the request of the ots  we reduced the level of broker deposits at union federal by million  some of which we were able to offset by increases in other types of deposits 
the order requires union federal to obtain prior approval of the ots before increasing the dollar amount of brokered deposits 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal reflected the build up of the deposit balance at union federal  borrowings made under the education loan warehouse facility to fund the private education loans reflected in cash used by operating activities  and the issuance of common stock 
cash used in fiscal of million reflected purchases of our stock under a stock repurchase plan and a higher dividend payout to shareholders 
the following table summarizes our time deposits  by maturity at june  in thousands within three months three to six months six months to one year over one year the maturities of these deposits are not directly indicative of future timing of cash needed for financing activities because they do not take into account the clients that will rollover their funds into new time deposits or into other types of deposit accounts 
we remain uncertain about future regulatory capital requirements relating to union federal and the extent to which we may contribute amounts to fund portfolio reserves pursuant to our monogram product 
however  we believe  based on our operating plan that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations through fiscal support of subsidiary bank union federal is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements would initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our liquidity 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for 
table of contents prompt corrective action  union federal must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of union federal s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classification  however  are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weighting and other factors 
union federal s equity capital was million at june  quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require union federal to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total capital and tier capital to risk weighted assets each as defined in the regulations 
see note  union federal regulatory capital requirements  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report for union federal quantitative measures 
in july  fmc entered into the supervisory agreement and union federal consented to the order  pursuant to which fmc and union federal agreed to comply with certain requirements imposed by the ots  including reducing the level of private education loans held by union federal  which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition

treasury stock we had treasury stock of million and million at june  and  respectively 
our treasury stock balance was primarily derived from the repurchases of our common stock in open market transactions  although we are not repurchasing more stock for the foreseeable future 
treasury stock also includes shares of our stock withheld from employees to satisfy statutory minimum withholding obligations as equity compensation awards vest 
in april  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of common stock 
as of june   we repurchased an aggregate of  shares under this program at an average price paid per share  excluding commissions  of per share under this repurchase program 
we did not repurchase any shares of common stock pursuant to this program during the twelve months ended june  or contractual obligations in july  union federal s subsidiary  ufsb private loan spv  llc  or ufsb spv  entered into a million education loan warehouse facility with a third party conduit lender to fund the purchase of private education loans by ufsb spv from union federal 
the facility provided interim financing which we used to fund the disbursement of private education loans by union federal 
at june  and june   million and million  respectively  were outstanding under the facility 
under the facility  ufsb spv pledged the purchased private education loans as collateral for the advances it received from the conduit lender 
the conduit lender s recourse to us under the indenture is limited to the private education loans pledged as collateral 
the teri reorganization  and subsequent teri ratings downgrades  resulted in events of termination under the indenture relating to the facility 
as a result  the facility termination date was declared  ufsb spv is not eligible for further borrowings under the facility  and the conduit lender may elect to accelerate repayment of notes outstanding under the facility 
in fiscal  additional events of termination occurred under the indenture relating to the one and three month default ratios on the underlying portfolio 
in april  union federal sold substantially all of its economic interest in the facility to a newly formed subsidiary of fmc 
as a result of the transaction  the private education loans held by ufsb spv  and the related indebtedness to the conduit lender  were eliminated from union federal s balance sheet  which accommodated regulatory capital compliance under the regulations of the ots

previously  union federal could borrow up to of the outstanding principal balance of its private education loans in a current repayment status 
the interest rate on the facility is variable based on the federal reserve bank of boston s stated rates 
at june   we had million available for borrowings from the federal reserve bank discount window through union federal 
in addition  we had million available for borrowing under an unused line of credit with the federal home loan bank of boston 
there were no borrowings outstanding with either institution at june  we expect an increase in amounts available for borrowings through the discount window after october   as a result of the changes enacted by the federal reserve bank of boston

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk 
interest rate risk applies to all of our interest bearing assets and liabilities as well as service revenue receivables 
credit risk is primarily related to loans held for sale  service revenue receivables  mortgage loans  cash equivalents and investments 
interest rate risk the interest rate characteristics of our interest bearing assets are driven by the nature  volume and duration of our interest bearing liabilities 
generally  our interest bearing liabilities are either variable rate instruments or are of a short duration and are subject to frequent repricing at maturity 
less than of our customer deposits at union federal have fixed interest rates in excess of twelve months 
approximately of the deposits have fixed interest rates of six months or less 
deposit pricing is subject to weekly examination by a committee of senior bank management and representatives from corporate finance  and risk and compliance management 
the committee looks at pricing of competitors and inflows and outflows of deposit balances at the customer level 
pricing decisions are made based on the desired volume of deposits in each given duration and product type 
outstanding borrowings under the education loan warehouse facility carry interest at prime plus and reprice daily 
none of our other liabilities bear interest 
the frequent repricing of our liabilities drives our investment decisions 
all of our private education loans  and approximately of our mortgage loans  have variable interest rates 
excess cash is primarily invested in federal funds sold and us federal agency mortgage backed securities  depending on the expected timing of time deposit turnover and other cash needs 
the matching of the interest rate characteristics and duration of assets and liabilities mitigates interest rate risk with respect to net interest revenue 
however  we are still subject to interest rate risk because as interest rates decline  the spreads between our assets and liabilities narrow and net interest income declines 
the fair value of private education loans held for sale will fluctuate due to variance in prepayments and discount rates  as well as the multi year forward estimates of the libor rate  which is the reference rate for the loan assets and assumed borrowings  and buyer s equity assumptions used in our cash flow model 
we frequently monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated fair value of these assets 
we believe that we have adequately addressed interest rate risks in our cash flow models 
credit risk we manage cash and investments conservatively 
the primary objective of our investment policy is the preservation of capital 
therefore  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are only placed in aa rated or better investment vehicles  federal funds sold or government agency mortgage backed securities 
union federal offers conventional conforming and non conforming fixed and variable interest rate first and second residential mortgage loans  as well as commercial real estate loans 
we base underwriting criteria primarily on credit score  consumer credit file information  and collateral characteristics  and all mortgage loans are underwritten to be saleable to institutional investors

private education loans are not offered through union federal as of the date of this annual report 
we use default prevention and early awareness procedures to mitigate credit risk on the portfolio and are considering selling the union federal portfolio in connection with a recent order by the ots 
see note  subsequent events supervisory agreement and order to cease and desist  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report for additional information 
our assumptions regarding defaults and recoveries of loans securitized and teri s obligation and ability to pay claims on defaulted loans affect the expected timing of cash payments to us in respect of additional structural advisory fees  asset servicing fees and residual cash flows  and our estimates of their fair value 
if we were to determine that recoveries with respect to a trust s defaulted education loans would be unavailable to replenish the trust s pledged account  the estimated value of our additional structural advisory fees would be reduced 
in addition  increases in our estimates of defaults  as well as decreases in default recovery rates would have a negative effect on the value of our additional structural advisory fees
