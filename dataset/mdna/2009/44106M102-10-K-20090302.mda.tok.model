developments marriott kauai resort beach club lease effective january   we entered into a new lease for our marriott kauai resort beach club hotel with a subsidiary of marriott 
this hotel was previously part of a hotel portfolio leased to one of our trss  and managed by marriott 
the rent payable to us under the lease is  per annum subject to annual adjustment based upon changes in the consumer price index 
the lease agreement expires december   and marriott has four renewal options of years each 
marriott guarantees the rent payable to us under the lease 
pursuant to the lease agreement  we agreed to fund certain planned improvements to the hotel 
the annual minimum rent payable to us under the lease will increase as improvements are funded 
sparks  nevada travel center acquisition on march   we acquired the land and improvements at our petro stopping centers branded travel center located in sparks  nevada from a third party for  we simultaneously leased them to travelcenters of america llc  or ta  and rent under our lease with ta for petro stopping centers branded travel centers was increased by  per annum 
we funded the acquisition with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
ta lease amendment on may   we entered into an amendment to our lease with ta for travel centers 
the historical lease provided for our purchase from ta of a total of  of specified capital improvements to the leased travel centers during the first five years of the term  and that these purchases were limited to  per year 
the amendment provides that ta may accelerate our purchase of the specified capital improvements 
in the event that ta sells us capital improvements before the time contractually required by the original lease terms  our purchase commitment amount is discounted to reflect the accelerated disbursement of funds by us according to a present value formula established in the amendment 
as of december   our remaining undiscounted purchase commitment under this lease is  ta rent deferral arrangement when we created ta and distributed ta shares to our shareholders on january   ta was capitalized with approximately  of cash and working capital 
later in  we acquired the real estate of petro stopping centers  lp  or petro  with ta and ta completed an equity offering for net proceeds of approximately  at the time of these transactions  we and ta believed that ta was adequately capitalized to meet all of its obligations to us 
however  since then there have been material changes in the market conditions in which ta operates 
specifically  the increase during the first half of in the price of diesel fuel which ta buys and sells at its travel centers and the current us recession adversely affected ta s business and increased its working capital requirements 
ta has undertaken a restructuring of its business to adjust to these changed market conditions 
we believe that ta s operating cash flows were sufficient to meet ta s rent obligations to us 
however  while certain ta operating issues appear to have been addressed  ta s balance sheet flexibility and liquidity remain a concern  as a prolonged economic downturn and fuel price volatility may negatively impact ta s future operating results and working capital requirements 
under these circumstances  on august   we and ta agreed upon a rent deferral arrangement to allow ta to build a working capital cushion 
significant terms of this arrangement include ta currently leases travel centers from us under two leases for combined rent of  per month 
this rent amount periodically increases pursuant to formulas in the leases 
ta will 
table of contents have the option to defer its monthly rent payments to us by up to  per month for periods beginning july  until december  ta is not obligated to pay cash interest on the deferred rent through december  ta issued  ta common shares to us of ta s shares outstanding immediately after this new issuance and of ta s shares outstanding as of december  
in the event ta does not defer monthly rental payments for the full permitted amounts through december   it may repurchase a pro rata amount of ta shares issued to us for nominal consideration 
as of december    shares of ta common stock remained eligible for repurchase if ta does not exercise its right to defer any additional rent in the future 
unpaid rent deferrals bear interest payable to us monthly at the rate of per annum  beginning january  there are no rent deferrals permitted for rent periods after december  any deferred rent and interest thereon not paid is due to us on july  any deferred amounts and interest may be prepaid at anytime 
this deferral agreement also includes a prohibition on share purchases and dividends by ta while any deferred rent remains unpaid and has change of control as defined in the deferral agreement covenants so that amounts deferred will be payable to us in the event ta experiences a change of control while deferred rent is unpaid 
from july  through december   ta deferred  of rent under this agreement 
the agreement we have entered with ta provides for rent deferral  not rent forgiveness 
we believe ta s recent operating results demonstrate that ta has a valuable business franchise which provides it with the ability to pay its rent obligations 
this agreement is intended by us to afford ta improved financial flexibility to meet its working capital needs which resulted from the unusual combination of significant price increases and volatility in diesel fuel prices during a period of slowing demand for the products and services which ta sells 
despite the fact that this is a deferral agreement  we have determined that  due to the uncertainties regarding ta s ability to perform its obligations under the leases  generally accepted accounting principles require us to reserve previously accrued straight line rent and to defer recognition of future straight line and deferred rents until circumstances change or these amounts are collected 
us hotel industry the us economy has been in a recession since december as a result of the impact of a recessionary economy  in the us hotel industry experienced declines versus in occupancy  revenues and profitability 
we believe these declines resulted primarily from reduced business and leisure travel resulting from reduced business and consumer spending 
during  most of our hotel operators reported declines in the operating performance of our hotels versus the prior year 
as of december   all returns and rent payments due to us under our hotel operating agreements were current 
our hotel operating agreements contain security features  such as guarantees and security deposits  which are intended to protect payments of minimum returns and rents to us in accordance with our operating agreements regardless of hotel performance 
however  the effectiveness of various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured  particularly if travel patterns continue at depressed levels for extended periods 
if our tenants  managers or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our cash flows will decline and we may become unable to pay distributions at the current rate or at any rate 
capital markets during  the capital markets experienced a continuing lessening of capital availability for businesses whose obligations are not guaranteed by governments 
at the beginning of  we believed unsecured credit was still available to investment grade companies in hospitality related businesses but that costs had begun to rise significantly 
by about mid year  it appeared to us that unsecured credit might be prohibitively expensive to most hospitality companies but that secured debt may be available 
by year end  it appeared to us that secured debt was becoming very expensive to companies that own hospitality real estate  and that the availability of such debt was 
table of contents limited 
because we own a large number of unencumbered properties  because we believe we have a history of operating our business in a financially conservative manner and because we do not have any material amounts of current debt maturities  we do not believe that the present adverse capital market conditions jeopardize our ability to operate our business at this time 
however  we do not know how long the illiquid current capital market conditions may persist  and we are closely monitoring the market conditions and considering financial alternatives which may be available in the event that the current conditions continue for an extended period 
year to date update the financial performance of the hotel industry generally and our hotel properties continued to deteriorate during january and february revenue per available room  or revpar  at our hotels was down approximately in january compared to january marriott has recently notified us that the operating performance of our hotels in the operating agreements we call marriott nos 
and were projected to not meet our minimum return rent requirements during the first quarter of marriott s guarantees for deficiency amounts earned at our hotels in the marriott operating agreements nos 
and have expired  but we continue to hold security deposits for each of the operating agreements in the amounts of approximately  and  respectively 
the notices we received with respect to our operating agreement known as marriott no 
were followed by payments to us of amounts which were less than the minimum monthly returns required in this agreement for the first three periods of the amount of the deficiencies were  for the first period   for the second period and  for the third period 
in each of the first two instances we sent marriott a notice that there was a deficiency in the amount of the minimum payment due to us and  in each case  marriott paid the deficiency amount within the ten day cure period established in this operating agreement 
we sent marriott a notice regarding the deficiency for the third period on march  if marriott does not pay the third period deficiency we will reduce the amount of the security deposit we hold for the marriott no 
operating agreement by the amount of the deficiency as well as possibly take other actions permitted under the operating agreement 
with respect to our operating agreement known as marriott no 
 we received payment of the full minimum rent required in this agreement for the first two periods in the payment we received for the third period of was less than the full minimum rent required under this agreement 
on march   we sent crestline  our tenant under the marriott no 
operating agreement  and marriott  the manager of the hotels included in our marriott no 
agreement  a notice of default 
pursuant to the terms of the operating agreement  crestline and or marriott has ten days to cure this default 
if we do not receive the deficiency amount within the applicable cure period we will reduce the amount of the security deposit we hold for the marriott no 
agreement by the amount of the deficiency and pursue other remedies available to us under the operating agreement  including possible termination of the lease 
should we reduce the amounts of the security deposits we hold for these agreement or any other operating agreements for payment deficiencies  the applications of the security deposits will cause us to record income equal to the full amounts of the minimum return due to us  but it will not result in cash flow to us of the deficiency amounts 
we are currently having discussions with marriott concerning payments which may be made to us from these hotels in the current hotel industry conditions  but we do not know whether marriott will continue to pay the full minimum returns due to us with respect to marriott no 
or if marriott or crestline will pay the full rent due to us with respect to our marriott no 
agreement 
ta produced net operating income in the third and fourth quarters of we believe that these results were achieved  in large part  by expense controls and business strategy changes implemented by ta during the early part of the current economic recession in the us continues to cause ta fuel volumes to decline 
one of ta s largest competitors has recently filed for bankruptcy 
we believe there may be limits to the amount of additional expense savings ta can achieve without jeopardizing the long term value of its businesses and out travel center properties 
ta has elected to defer  of rent due in each of january and february  as it is permitted to due under the rent deferral arrangement we entered with ta in august

table of contents the decrease in hotel operating revenues in versus was caused primarily by the sale of managed hotels in february  june and december and the conversion of our kauai marriott hotel from managed to leased effective january   partially offset by slightly higher revenues at our remaining managed hotels 
revenues decreased at most of our managed hotels from due to lower occupancy rates  however  these declines were offset by increased revenues at our recently renovated and rebranded hyatt place hotels

we recognized additional returns of  and  in the fourth quarter and  respectively 
the decrease in additional returns from is due primarily to weaker operating performance as a result of the recessionary us economy described above 
all of our managed hotels generated net operating results above the minimum returns due to us in certain of our managed hotels had net operating results that were  less than the minimum returns due to us in  but these amounts were funded by our tenants and operators 
we reflected these amounts in our consolidated statement of income as a reduction to hotel operating expense because the minimum returns were funded by the manager of these hotels 
the increase in minimum rents hotels is a result of the conversion of the kauai marriott hotel to a leased hotel as described above and our funding of improvements at certain of our leased hotels in and that resulted in increases in the annual minimum rents due to us 
the increase in minimum rents travel centers is a result of our acquisition of travel centers and commencement of our second lease with ta on may   offset by the deferral agreement with ta as described above 
rental income travel centers includes  and  of adjustments necessary to record rent on the straight line basis for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
for the reasons described above  we ceased recognizing straight line rent under our lease with ta for travel centers in the second quarter of the decrease in percentage rent hotels is the result of decreased sales compared to base year sales at our leased hotels 
ff e reserve income hotels represents amounts paid by certain of our hotel tenants into restricted accounts owned by us  the purpose of which is to accumulate funds for future capital expenditures 
the terms of our hotel leases require these amounts to be calculated as a percentage of total sales at our hotels 
the increase in ff e reserve income hotels is primarily due to the conversion of the kauai marriott hotel to a leased hotel as described above offset by decreased levels of hotel sales in versus at our leased hotels 
we do not report the amounts which are escrowed as ff e reserves for our managed hotels

we recognized additional returns of  and  in the fourth quarter and  respectively 
the increase in additional returns from is due to the improved operating performance of our managed hotels in described above 
as a result of renovations which required hotel rooms to be taken out of service in and  certain of our managed hotels had net operating results that were  and  less than the minimum returns due to us in and  respectively 
these amounts are reflected in our consolidated statement of income as a net reduction to hotel operating expenses in these years because the minimum returns were funded by our managers 
the increase in minimum rents hotels is a result of our funding of improvements at certain of our leased hotels in and that caused in increases in the annual minimum rents due to us

the increase in income tax expense is primarily due to increased canadian income taxes at one of our trss and higher state income taxes as a result of a change in tax laws in the state of texas

table of contents shareholders and the corresponding per common share amounts are primarily due to the investment and operating activities discussed above 
on a per share basis  the percentage increases in income from continuing operations available for common shareholders  income from discontinued operations available for common shareholders and net income available for common shareholders was lower due to our issuance of common shares in july and december and february liquidity and capital resources our managers and tenants all of our properties are operated under management agreements or leases 
all costs of operating and maintaining our properties are paid by the third party hotel managers as agents for us or by hotel or travel center tenants for their own account 
these managers and tenants derive their funding for property operating expenses  ff e reserve  and returns and rents due to us generally from property operating revenues and  to the extent that these managers and tenants fund our minimum returns and minimum rents  from their separate resources 
we define coverage for each of our management agreements or leases as total property sales minus all property level expenses that are not subordinated to the minimum returns and minimum rents due to us and the required ff e reserve contributions  divided by the aggregate minimum payments due to us 
more detail regarding coverage  guarantees and other security features of our operating agreements is presented in the tables on pages through assuming our eleven hotel operating agreements as of december  had been in place during the twelve months ended december   ten agreements  representing hotels  generated coverage of at least x using historical operating results 
one hotel agreement generated coverage below x during the rents due under this agreement are guaranteed by marriott  the parent of the lessee 
assuming our two travel center leases  representing and properties as of december  had been in place during the twelve months ended december   the agreements would have generated coverage of x and x  respectively  using historical operating results 
as described above  effective july   we entered into a rent deferral agreement with ta  the tenant under our two travel center leases 
however  we calculated the rent coverage ratios for the twelve months ended december  using the contractual rent amounts without consideration of the rent deferral 
because substantially all of ta s business is conducted at properties leased from us  property level rent coverage may not be an appropriate way to evaluate ta s ability to pay rents due to us 
we believe property level rent coverage is nonetheless one useful indicator of the performance and value of our properties as we believe it is what a operator interested to acquire these properties or the leaseholds might evaluate these properties contributions to their earnings before corporate level expenses 
three hundred fifty of our properties  representing of our total investments at cost as of december   are operated under nine management arrangements or leases which are subject to full or limited guarantees 
these guarantees may provide us with continued payments if the total sales less total expenses and required ff e reserve payments fail to equal or exceed guaranteed amounts due to us 
some of our managers and tenants or their affiliates may also supplement cash flow from our properties in order to make payments to us and preserve their rights to continue operating our properties even if they are not required to do so by guarantees 
guarantee or supplemental payments to us  if any  made under any of our management agreements or leases  do not subject us to repayment obligations but  under some of our agreements  these guarantee or supplemental payments may be recovered by the manager  tenant or guarantor from the future cash flows from our properties after our future minimum returns and minimum rents are paid 
as described above  on march   we sent marriott and crestline notices regarding deficiencies in the payment of the minimum return rents due us on march  under the marriott no 
and marriott no 
agreements  respectively 
as of march   all other payments due from 
table of contents our managers and tenants are current 
however  the effectiveness of our various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured  particularly if the current economic downturn continues for a prolonged period 
if any of our property operators  tenants or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our cash flows will decline 
our operating liquidity and capital resources our principal source of funds for current expenses and distributions to shareholders are minimum returns from our managed hotels and minimum rents from our leased hotels and travel centers 
we receive minimum returns and minimum rents from our managers and tenants monthly 
we receive additional returns  percentage returns and rents and our share of the operating profits of our managed hotels after payment of all management fees and other deductions either monthly or quarterly 
this flow of funds has historically been sufficient for us to pay our operating expenses  interest and distributions to shareholders 
we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  interest and distribution payments for the foreseeable future 
however  given the weak us economy and its impact on the hotel and travel center industries  our operators and tenants may be unable to pay minimum returns and minimum rents to us when due  in which case our cash flow and net income will decline and we may need to reduce the amount of our distributions to common shareholders 
we maintain our status as a reit under the irc by meeting certain requirements 
as a reit  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on the majority of our income 
in  federal legislation known as the rma  was enacted and became effective on january  the rma  among other things  allows a reit to lease hotels to trss if the hotels are managed by an independent third party 
the income realized by our trss in excess of the rent they pay to us is subject to income tax at corporate tax rates 
also  the income we receive from our hotels in canada  puerto rico and certain states is subject to taxes in those jurisdictions 
our investment and financing liquidity and capital resources various percentages of total sales at most of our hotels are escrowed as ff e reserves to fund future capital improvements 
during the twelve months ended december   our hotel managers and hotel tenants contributed  to these accounts and  was spent from the ff e reserve escrow accounts and from our payments to renovate and refurbish our hotels 
as of december   there was  on deposit in these escrow accounts  which was held directly by us and is reflected on our balance sheet as restricted cash 
our hotel operating agreements generally provide that  if necessary  we will provide our managers and tenants with funding for capital improvements to our hotels in excess of amounts otherwise available in escrowed ff e reserves 
to the extent we make such additional fundings  our annual minimum returns or minimum rents generally increase by a percentage of the amount we fund 
during the twelve months ended december   we funded  for capital improvements to our hotels in excess of ff e reserve fundings available from hotel operations  as follows during the twelve months ended december   we funded  for improvements to hotels included in our four marriott portfolio agreements using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we expect to fund between  and  for improvements to our marriott hotels during and with funds from our existing cash balances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
pursuant to an april agreement we entered with a subsidiary of hyatt  for management of amerisuites hotels  we agreed to provide funding to hyatt for rebranding of these hotels to the hyatt place brand and for other improvements 
to the extent our fundings exceed  the minimum return payable by hyatt to us increases as these funds are advanced 
as of 
table of contents december   we have funded  we funded  of this amount during the twelve months ended december  using funds from our existing cash balances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we currently do not expect to make additional fundings in pursuant to january and april agreements we entered with intercontinental  for the management of ten hotels  we agreed to fund  for capital improvements to these hotels during the three years following closing 
we funded  in january   in january and the final  in january  using funds from our existing cash balances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
pursuant to a january lease agreement we entered with a subsidiary of marriott for our kauai hotel  we agreed to fund certain planned improvements to the hotel 
we funded  for improvements in february under this agreement with funds from our existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the annual rent payable to us under the lease increases by approximately of the amounts funded for improvements at this hotel 
ff e escrow deposits are not required under our travel center leases with ta 
however  ta is required to maintain the leased travel centers  including structural and non structural components 
on may   we entered into an amendment to our lease with ta for travel centers 
the historical lease provided for our purchase from ta of an aggregate of  of specified capital improvements to the leased travel centers during the first five years of the lease term  and that these purchases were limited to  per year 
the amendment provides that ta may accelerate our purchase of the specified capital improvements 
in the event that ta sells us capital improvements before the time contractually required by the original lease terms  our purchase commitment amount is discounted to reflect the accelerated disbursement of funds by us according to a present value formula established in the amendment 
as of december   we have funded  and our remaining undiscounted purchase commitment under this lease is  which we expect to fund in using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
under both our leases with ta  ta may request that we fund additional amounts for capital improvements to the leased facilities in return for annual minimum rent increases  we made no fundings under such lease provisions during the twelve months ended december  on january   april   july  and october   we paid a per share distribution to our series b preferred shareholders with respect to the periods ended january   april   july  and october   respectively 
on december   we declared a per share distribution to series b preferred shareholders of record on december  with respect to the period ended january  we paid this distribution on january  we funded these distributions using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on february   may   august  and november  we paid a per share distribution to our series c preferred shareholders with respect to the periods ended february   may   august  and november  on january   we declared a distribution of per series c preferred shareholders with respect to the period ending february  we paid this distribution on february  we funded these distributions using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on february   may   august  and november   we paid a per share distribution to our common shareholders  for the quarters ended december   march   june  and september   respectively 
on january   we declared a per share distribution to our common shareholders of record on january  we paid this distribution on february  we funded these distributions using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents on march   we redeemed  of our senior notes using borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on march   we acquired certain land and improvements at our petro travel center in sparks  nevada for  we funded this acquisition with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in order to fund capital improvements to our properties and acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of returns and rents and our desire or need to make distributions or pay operating expenses  we maintain a revolving credit facility with a group of institutional lenders 
the maturity date of our revolving credit facility is october  and we have the option to extend the facility for one additional year upon payment of an extension fee of  the annual interest rate payable for drawn amounts under the facility is libor plus a premium totaling per annum at december  
we may borrow up to  under the revolving credit facility and it includes a feature under which the maximum amount available for borrowing may be expanded to  in certain circumstances 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility are unsecured 
we may draw  repay and redraw funds until maturity  and no principal repayment is due until maturity 
as of december   we had a balance of  outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had  of cash excluding ff e restricted cash and cash equivalents and  available from our revolving credit facility 
we expect to use existing cash balances  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future property acquisitions and other general business purposes 
our term debt maturities other than our revolving credit facility are as follows  in   in   in   in   in   in   in  and  in our convertible senior notes  due in are convertible if certain conditions are met including certain changes in control into cash equal to the principal amount of the notes and  to the extent the market price of our common shares exceeds the exchange price of per share  subject to adjustment  either cash or our common shares at our option  with a value based on such excess amount 
holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march   march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events 
as of december   we had one mortgage note we assumed in connection with our acquisition of one hotel with a current principal balance of  this mortgage note requires monthly payments of principal and interest of and is expected to have a principal balance of  at maturity in july none of our other debt obligations require principal or sinking fund payments prior to their maturity date 
in connection with our acquisition of petro stopping centers holdings  lp  or petro holdings  we acquired certain petro holdings properties which secure debt that was previously issued by petro 
upon closing of our acquisition of petro holdings  the petro debt assumed by ta was covenant defeased and funds were escrowed to redeem the petro debt 
ta redeemed this debt on february  when amounts are outstanding under our revolving credit facility and as the maturity dates of our revolving credit facility and term debts approach over the longer term  we will explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due 
such alternatives in the short term and long term may include incurring additional debt and issuing new equity securities 
we have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis  but does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities 
recent capital markets conditions have been challenging 
the availability and cost of credit have been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid capital markets and wide credit spreads  and 
table of contents equity markets have been extremely volatile 
while we believe we will have access to various types of financings  including debt or equity offerings  to fund our future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any debt or equity offerings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will be reasonable 
if current market conditions continue or worsen  one or more lenders under our revolving credit facility may be unable or unwilling to fund advances which we request or we may not be able to access additional capital 
our ability to continue to access capital could be impacted by various factors including general market conditions and the continuing slowdown in the economy  interest rates  credit ratings on our securities  the market price of our capital stock  the performance of our tenants  borrowers and operators  including any restructurings  disruptions or bankruptcies of our tenants  borrowers and operators  and the perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions 
impacts such as these might impair our ability to make future acquisitions and make our current growth plans unachievable 
also  the current market conditions have led to materially increased credit spreads which  if they continue  may result in material increases in the interest costs under our floating rate debts and our fixed rate debts when we refinance or when we incur new debt 
these interest cost increases could have material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial conditions 
in february  we repurchased and retired  of our convertible senior notes at a total cost of  including transaction costs but excluding accrued interest  using borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we expect to record a gain of approximately  net of unamortized deferred financing costs  on the early extinguishment of this debt in the first quarter of as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows payment due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations ground lease obligations capital improvements projected interest expense total holders of our convertible senior notes  due in may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march   march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events prior to march  the amounts in the table reflect these notes as being due on their maturity date and therefore are included in the more than years category 
in february  we repurchased and retired  of our convertible senior notes 
of our hotels and of our travel centers are on land leased partially or in its entirety 
in each case the ground lessors are unrelated to us 
generally  payments of ground lease obligations are made by our managers or tenants 
however  if a manager or tenant fails to perform obligations under a ground lease or elects not to renew any ground lease  we might have to perform obligations under the ground lease or renew the ground lease in order to protect our investment in the affected hotel or travel center 
represents amounts we expect to fund for capital improvements to our properties in addition to recurring ff e reserve funding from hotel operations 
projected interest expense is attributable to only the long term debt obligations listed above at existing rates and is not intended to project future interest costs which may result from debt prepayments  new debt issuances or changes in interest rates 

table of contents as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  guarantees  joint ventures or partnerships 
as of december   our secured debt obligations were limited to one mortgage note of  secured by a single property 
none of our debt documentation requires us to provide collateral security in the event of a ratings downgrade 
debt covenants our debt obligations at december   consist of our revolving credit facility  our  of unsecured term debt and convertible notes and our  mortgage note 
our unsecured term debt and convertible notes are governed by an indenture 
this indenture and related supplements and our revolving credit facility agreement contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts  including debts secured by mortgages on our properties  in excess of calculated amounts  require us to maintain a minimum net worth  restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain various financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our covenants under our indenture and its supplements and our revolving credit facility agreement 
neither our indenture and its supplements nor our revolving credit facility contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings 
however  under our revolving credit facility agreement  our senior debt rating is used to determine the fees and interest rate applied to borrowings 
if our credit rating is downgraded  our interest expense and related costs under our revolving credit facility would therefore increase 
our public debt indenture and its supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of  or more 
similarly  our revolving credit facility agreement has cross default provisions to other indebtedness that is recourse of  or more and indebtedness that is non recourse of  or more 
related person transactions we have no employees 
rmr provides management services to us and also provides management services to other public and private companies  including hrp  snh  five star and ta

in addition  rmr receives an incentive fee based upon increases in our cash available for distribution per share  as defined in the business management agreement 
the incentive fee is paid in common shares 
our property management agreement with rmr provides for management fees relating to the office building  equal to of gross rents and construction management fees equal to of certain construction costs

critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
we believe that our judgments and assessments are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our five most critical accounting policies are as follows classification of leases 
certain of our properties are leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital or operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a leased property  appropriate present value discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 
allocation of purchase price and recognition of depreciation and amortization expense 
the acquisition cost of each property investment is allocated to various property components such as land  buildings and equipment  and each component generally has a different useful life 
for real estate acquired  we allocate the purchase price among building  land  furniture  fixtures and equipment  and  if applicable  the value of in place leases  the fair market value of above or below market leases and customer relationships 
acquisition cost allocations and the determination of the useful lives are based on our estimates or studies from independent experts 
we compute related depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements  and up to years for personal property 
the value of intangible assets is amortized over the shorter of 
table of contents their estimated useful lives  or the term of the respective lease or the affected contract 
the allocated cost of land is not depreciated 
inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs or incorrect estimates of useful lives could result in depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
impairment of long lived assets and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate our real estate investments assets for impairment indicators 
these indicators may include weak or declining operating profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related investment by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from that investment 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
we test our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test requires us to determine the estimated fair value of the intangible asset 
an impairment charge is recorded if the fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value 
estimated fair value for our long lived assets and indefinite lived intangible assets are determined through an evaluation of recent financial performance and projected discounted cash flows using standard industry valuation techniques 
this analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future operating profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate  fail to record a charge when we should have done so or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
variable interest entities 
under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  if an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity  it must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the enterprise that absorbs the majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
generally  expected losses and expected residual returns are the expected negative and positive variability  respectively  in the fair value of the variable interest entities net assets 
when our trs enters a new operating agreement or materially modifies an existing operating agreement with a third party hotel manager we are required to assess if our trs is or continues to be the primary beneficiary 
this assessment requires us to make estimates of the future cash flows of our trs 
incorrect assumptions or estimates of  among other things  occupancy  average daily room rate and operating expenses of our hotels may result in an inaccurate determination of the primary beneficiary 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas accounting for income taxes 
under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be realized when necessary 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the irc and are generally not subject to federal and state income taxation on our operating income provided we distribute our taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain organization and operating requirements 
we are subject to income tax in canada  puerto rico and in certain states despite our reit status 
further  we lease our managed hotels to our wholly owned trs that  unlike most of our subsidiaries is generally subject to federal  state and foreign income tax 
our consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes the income tax provision or benefit related to the operations of the 
table of contents trs and state and foreign income taxes incurred by us despite our tax status as a reit 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin fin prescribes how we should recognize  measure and present in our financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return 
pursuant to fin  we can recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit 
to the extent the more likely than not standard has been satisfied  the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
as required  we adopted fin effective january  and have concluded that the effect is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of fin tax returns filed for the through tax years are subject to examination by taxing authorities 
we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions  if any  in our financial statements as a component of general and administrative expense 
these policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual values  the ability of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us  and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our properties operate 
in the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not now known  and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets 
property management agreements  leases and operating statistics as of december   we owned hotels and travel centers which are grouped into operating agreements 
our hotels are managed by or leased to subsidiaries of hotel operating companies including intercontinental  marriott  host  barcelo crestline corporation  or barcelo crestline  hyatt and carlson under agreements 
our travel centers are leased to and operated by subsidiaries of ta under two agreements

table of contents seasonality our hotels and travel centers have historically experienced seasonal differences typical of their industries with higher revenues in the second and third quarters of calendar years compared with the first and fourth quarters 
this seasonality is not expected to cause material fluctuations in our income or cash flow because our contractual management agreements and leases require our managers and tenants to make the substantial portion of our return payments and rents to us in equal amounts throughout a year 
seasonality may affect our hotel operating revenues  but we do not expect seasonal variations to have a material impact upon our financial results of operations or upon our managers or tenants ability to meet their contractual obligations to us 
impact of inflation inflation might have both positive and negative impacts upon us 
inflation might cause the value of our real estate investments to increase 
in an inflationary environment  the percentage returns and rents which we receive based upon a percentage of gross revenues should increase 
offsetting these benefits  inflation might cause our costs of equity and debt capital and other operating costs to increase 
an increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs will result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues 
in periods of rapid inflation  our managers or tenants operating costs may increase faster than revenues and this fact may have an adverse impact upon us if the operating income from our properties becomes insufficient to pay our returns or rents 
to mitigate the adverse impact of insufficient income at our properties  all of our operating agreements contain security features  such as security deposits or guarantees of our returns or rents 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased costs of debt capital in the event of material inflation  we may enter into interest rate hedge arrangements in the future  the decision to enter into these agreements will be based on the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding  our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollar amounts in thousands we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 
as of december   our outstanding publicly tradable debt consisted of seven issues of fixed rate  senior unsecured notes and one issue of fixed rate convertible senior notes principal balance annual interest rate annual interest expense maturity interest payments due   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually the convertible senior notes are convertible if certain conditions are met including certain changes in control into cash equal to the principal amount of the notes and  to the extent the market price of our common shares exceeds the initial exchange price of per share  subject to adjustment  either cash or our common shares at our option with a value based on such excess amount 
holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march   march   and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events prior to march  except as described in the footnote to the table above  no principal repayments are due under these notes until maturity 
because these notes bear interest at fixed rates  changes in market interest rates during the term of this debt will not affect our operating results 
however  if at maturity these notes were refinanced at interest rates which are higher than shown above  our per annum interest cost would increase by approximately  changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
based on the balances outstanding at december   and discounted cash flow analyses  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations by approximately  change in the trading price of our common shares may also affect the fair value of our  of convertible senior notes 
each of these fixed rate unsecured debt arrangements allows us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date 
we are generally allowed to make prepayments only at face value plus a premium equal to a make whole amount  as defined  which is generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the note holder 
these prepayment rights may afford us the opportunity to mitigate the risk of refinancing at maturity at higher rates by refinancing prior to maturity 
at december   we had one mortgage payable secured by one hotel  with a principal balance of  and a fixed interest rate of that matures on july  this note requires monthly principal and interest payments of through maturity pursuant to an amortization schedule

for example  the interest rate payable on our outstanding indebtedness of  under our revolving credit facility was per annum at december  the following table presents the impact a change in interest rates would have on our weighted average floating rate interest expense as of december  impact of changes in interest rates interest rate per year outstanding debt total interest expense per year at december  increase reduction the foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility or acquisition facility
