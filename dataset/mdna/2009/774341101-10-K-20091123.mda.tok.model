overview and outlook for many years  rockwell collins has benefited from having a diversified and balanced business  serving both commercial and government markets 
this diversification and balance was an important attribute that helped support the performance of our company during our commercial systems business was adversely impacted as the aerospace marketplace reacted sharply to the macroeconomic events of with a sudden and severe decline in demand 
meanwhile  our government systems business experienced stable end markets with continued demand for our systems  products and services 
we acted quickly to address these dynamic market conditions by redeploying resources where possible and by implementing infrastructure and cost reduction actions where necessary  which helped to preserve the financial strength and long term growth prospects of our company 
the actions included a restructuring plan  along with other cost saving initiatives  to better align our resources with this new environment 
as a result of the market dynamics and steps the company took to address those dynamics  we generated the following results for we achieved sales of billion we delivered earnings per share of we generated operating cash flow of million we continued to invest in research and development at percent of sales we believe rockwell collins has proven its ability to both react quickly to changing business conditions and to execute its business plans 
despite these exceptionally difficult times  our fundamental strategies have served us well the balance between our commercial and government businesses  the diversification of our customer base and product offerings  the integration of our business through our shared service operating model and our focus on innovation through r d 
balance we feel our business is characterized by its balance  in terms of market segment  geographic  product and customer sales mix 
we strive to maintain a balance between our government and commercial systems businesses  believing that the segments are complementary to one another 
in  we expect the stability of our government systems business to offset most of the volatility within our commercial systems business 
it is this aspect of our balanced business portfolio that makes it a fundamental strength of rockwell collins 
diversification our business derives its revenue streams from a large number of diverse customers  products  solutions and markets 
our government systems business executes against numerous programs every year for a variety of customers  including the us department of defense  other government agencies  civil agencies  defense contractors and foreign ministries of defense 
our commercial systems business serves customers ranging from the world s largest aircraft manufacturers to individual aircraft owners within the general aviation marketplace 
this diversification of revenue sources enables us to pursue numerous growth opportunities as business conditions vary across our portfolios 
integration we have a highly integrated business reliant upon a shared services operating platform 
the integrated nature of our business allows us to leverage product and service capabilities across our segments in a manner we believe is unique in our industry 
this integration is evidenced by our product and technology 
table of contents centers of excellence in areas such as displays  communication  navigation and surveillance  through which we apply our core competencies to solutions in both government and commercial systems 
innovation a well funded and comprehensive r d program is a foundational aspect of rockwell collins 
our focus on developing unique solutions to our customers needs is evidenced by the large investment we dedicate towards r d programs 
it is this spending profile that has allowed rockwell collins to successfully pursue and capture customer programs and that will continue to be the growth engine for our company 
looking forward to  we believe we are well positioned to operate in an environment that will continue to present challenges for our commercial systems business and modest opportunities for our government systems business 
highlights of our earnings guidance are as follows total sales in the range of billion to billion  or about a percent to percent increase over diluted earnings per share in the range of to cash provided by operating activities in the range of million to million capital expenditures of approximately million total company and customer funded r d expenditures in the range of million to million  or about percent of total sales see the following operating segment sections for further discussion of and anticipated segment results

these systems  products and services support airborne fixed and rotary wing  ground and shipboard applications 
the short and long term performance of our government systems business is affected by a number of factors  including the amount and prioritization of defense spending by the us and us governments  which is generally based on the underlying political landscape and security environment 
we expect global baseline defense budgets excluding supplemental appropriations to continue to increase  but at moderate rates as the volatility of the global threat environment is weighed against budgetary pressures created by the worldwide economic situation and non defense government spending and stimulus investing 
we expect high priority military transformation initiatives and cost effective solutions to modernize and replace aged weapons systems will lead to funding support for military communications and electronics equipment 
we expect that these customer priorities  combined with our strengthening positions in certain faster growing areas of our served defense electronics and communications markets  should enable us to continue to deliver above market rates of organic revenue growth 
our involvement in various elements of the joint tactical radio system jtrs program  our wide range of positions for fixed and rotary wing cockpit and mission electronics systems including kc refueling tankers and c cargo aircraft  as well as blackhawk  chinook  and sea stallion helicopters and our positions in precision guidance systems for missiles and munitions are examples of significant programs in these faster growing areas that have been  and are expected to continue to be  drivers of our growth going forward 
we are expanding our involvement in certain segments of the defense electronics market and expect to see future growth from sales of our products and services for unmanned air vehicles  ground vehicles and soldier worn electronic systems 
risks affecting future performance of our government systems business include  but are not limited to potential impact of geopolitical and economic events overall funding and prioritization of the us and us defense budgets funding for programs we have won at projected levels and without program delays our ability to win new business  successfully develop products and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirements we expect government systems sales to increase by approximately percent in compared to the revenue growth is expected to be derived from continued demand for avionics systems for tanker  transport and rotary wing aircraft  moderate increases in unmanned aerial system and international military system sales and growth in programs focused on communication and situational awareness solutions for soldier and ground vehicle applications 
revenues from the acquisition of datapath now rockwell collins satellite communication systems are expected to contribute approximately six percentage points of government systems revenue growth 

table of contents we project government systems operating margins will be lower than the percent segment operating margin reported in  primarily due to salary and incentive compensation increases in  an increase in retirement benefit costs and incremental lower margins on revenues from the datapath acquisition

table of contents commercial systems overview and outlook our commercial systems business supplies aviation electronics systems  products  and services to customers located throughout the world 
the customer base is comprised of oems of commercial air transport  business and regional aircraft  commercial airlines and fractional and other business aircraft operators 
the near and long term performance of our commercial systems business is impacted by general worldwide economic health  commercial airline flight hours  the financial condition of airlines worldwide as well as corporate profits 
in we saw a dramatic decline in new order activity and a significant number of aircraft order deferrals for both airbus and boeing  however  both companies were able to maintain their production rates by moving forward customers with continued need for new aircraft 
the market for new business jets experienced a significant deterioration as new orders slowed and customers cancelled orders  causing oems to cut their production rates and in some cases temporarily shut down their production 
deliveries of new regional airline aircraft were down in as airlines adjusted overall network capacity for reduced passenger traffic demand 
conditions for aftermarket service and support and equipment upgrade activities were weak throughout  as airlines and business jet operators reduced capacity and utilization and deferred discretionary upgrade and retrofit programs due to the overall weakness in the economic environment 
we believe the commercial aircraft production rates will be reduced in as compared to we believe air transport aircraft delivery rates will be up slightly in as compared to due to the impact of the labor strike at boeing during  and that business jet oems will enter at depressed production rates with a low probability of recovery during the year 
we also believe deliveries of new regional airline aircraft will be down in driven by lower orders as a result of airlines adjusting route structures and fleet mix to projected traffic demand 
we believe the commercial aerospace aftermarket environment will improve modestly throughout the year as overall economic conditions gradually lead to a recovery in airline travel and business jet utilization  with an associated recovery in maintenance and repair activity and modest increases in spending on discretionary aviation electronics 
risks to the commercial systems market include  among other things turbulence in global economic and financial markets could continue to have a significant impact on demand for air travel  airline demand for new aircraft and the availability of financing for new aircraft occurrence of an unexpected geopolitical or health pandemic event that could have a significant impact on demand for air travel and airline demand for new aircraft potential negative impact that fuel prices could have on the profitability of airline and other aircraft operator customers continued poor financial condition of certain major us and us airlines our ability to develop products and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirements development and market acceptance of our products and systems continued pressure on corporate profits we expect commercial systems sales to decline by percent in compared to this includes an approximate percent decline in sales related to aircraft oems with greater declines in the first half of the year and moderating declines in the second half 
sales related to aircraft oems in the air transport market are expected to increase about percent due to higher production rates in as compared to as a result of the impact of the boeing labor strike on production rates 
this sales growth also includes the impact of announced reductions in wide body aircraft production and a potential reduction in overall narrow body aircraft production rates in late sales related to aircraft oems in the business and regional jet markets are projected to decrease by over percent for the full fiscal year  as we expect the decrease in the business jet markets that we serve will only partially be offset by a projected increase in 
table of contents customer development programs for regional jet oems 
the overall net decrease is weighted more heavily during the first half of the fiscal year due to the timing of the downturn in business jet deliveries during the company s fiscal year aftermarket sales in both the air transport and business and regional jet markets are expected to experience low single digit full year revenue growth 
aftermarket sales are projected to decline on a year over year basis in the first half of due to the continuation of weak passenger traffic  poor airline profitability  and depressed business jet aircraft utilization 
we anticipate these conditions will improve in the second half of as a recovery in global economic conditions gains traction in our served markets 
we also expect a decline of approximately percent in sales related to wide body in flight entertainment wide body ife products and systems due to our decision in to cease investing in this product area 
we project commercial systems operating margins will be lower than the percent segment operating margins reported in  due primarily to the forecasted decrease in sales volumes  anticipated merit pay and incentive compensation increases and an increase in retirement benefit costs

in  defined benefit pension plan expense is expected to increase by approximately million to million of expense  compared to million of income in the expected increase is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of a decrease in the defined benefit pension plan valuation discount rate used to measure our us pension expense from percent in to percent in our objective with respect to the funding of our pension plans is to provide adequate assets for the payment of future benefits 
pursuant to this objective  we will fund our pension plans as required by governmental regulations and may consider discretionary contributions as conditions warrant 
we believe our strong financial position continues to provide us the opportunity to make contributions to our pension fund without inhibiting our ability to pursue strategic investments 
in october  subsequent to our year end  we made a million contribution to our us qualified pension plan 
we do not currently anticipate that we will be required by governmental regulations to make any additional contributions to the us qualified pension plan in any additional future contributions necessary to satisfy the minimum statutory funding requirements are dependent upon actual plan asset returns  interest rates and any changes to us pension funding legislation 
we may elect to make additional discretionary contributions during to further improve the funded status of this plan 
contributions to our non us plans and our non us non qualified plan are expected to total million in other retirement benefits we have historically provided retiree medical and life insurance benefits to substantially all of our employees 
we have undertaken two major actions over the past number of years with respect to these benefits that have lowered both the current and future costs of providing these benefits in july of  the pre and post retiree medical plans were amended to establish a fixed company contribution 
additional premium contributions will be required from participants for all costs in excess of this fixed contribution amount 
this amendment eliminated the risk to us related to health care cost escalations for retiree medical benefits going forward as additional contributions will be required from retirees for all costs in excess of our fixed contribution amount 
as a result of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  we amended our retiree medical plans on june  to discontinue post prescription drug coverage effective january  post retirees have the option of receiving these benefits through medicare 
on average  we believe the medicare prescription drug benefit is better than the benefit that was provided by our discontinued post drug plan

the increase in cash dividends in and was the result of an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from to per share beginning with the dividend paid on june  based on our current dividend policy  we will pay quarterly cash dividends which  on an annual basis  will equal per share 
we expect to fund dividends using cash generated from operations 
the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of the board of directors 
financial condition and liquidity we have historically maintained a financial structure characterized by conservative levels of debt outstanding that enables us sufficient access to credit markets 
when combined with our ability to generate strong levels of cash flow from our operations  this capital structure provides the strength and flexibility necessary to pursue strategic growth opportunities and to return value to our shareowners

receivables  net decreased million to million at september  and inventories  net decreased million to million at september  at september   receivables  net and inventories  net include million and million  respectively related to the acquisitions of datapath and seos 
we primarily fund our contractual obligations  capital expenditures  small to medium sized acquisitions  dividends and share repurchases from cash generated from operating activities 
due to the seasonality of cash flows  we supplement our internally generated cash flow from time to time by issuing short term commercial paper 
under our commercial paper program  we may sell up to million face amount of unsecured short term promissory notes in the commercial paper market 
the commercial paper notes have maturities of not more than days from the date of issuance 
we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september  at september   short term commercial paper borrowings outstanding were million 
in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is impaired  we have access to an million revolving credit facility through a network of banks that matures in  with options to further extend the term for up to two one year periods and or increase the aggregate principal amount up to billion 
these options are subject to the approval of the lenders 
our only financial covenant under the revolving credit facility requires that we maintain a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than percent  excluding the accumulated other comprehensive loss equity impact related to defined benefit retirement plans 
our debt to total capitalization ratio at september  based on this financial covenant was percent 
we had no borrowings at september  under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents in addition  alternative sources of liquidity could include funds available from the issuance of equity securities  debt securities and potential asset securitization strategies 
we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to which we can publicly offer and sell securities from time to time 
this shelf registration covers an unlimited amount of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock or warrants that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of sale 
to date  we have not raised capital through the issuance of equity securities as we prefer to use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners equity 
we review our mix of short term and long term debt on a regular basis 
given the volatility of the credit markets in resulting from the global financial crisis  we decided to solidify our liquidity position by issuing million of percent fixed rate unsecured debt that is due july  proceeds were primarily used to pay down our short term debt and fund our acquisition of datapath inc credit ratings are a significant factor in determining our ability to access short term and long term financing as well as the cost of such financing in terms of interest rates 
our strong credit ratings have enabled continued access to both short and long term credit markets despite difficult market conditions during if our credit ratings were to be adjusted downward by the rating agencies  the implications of such actions could include impairment or elimination of our access to credit markets and an increase in the cost of borrowing

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect our financial condition and results of operations that are reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosure of assets and liabilities contingent upon future events 
understanding the critical accounting policies discussed below and related risks is important in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are critical to our financial condition and results of operations as they involve a significant use of management judgment on matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates  there could be a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
management regularly discusses the identification and development of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

table of contents accounting for long term contracts a substantial portion of our sales to government customers and certain of our sales to commercial customers are made pursuant to long term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over several years and often contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
certain of these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
sales and earnings under the percentage of completion method are recorded either as products are shipped under the units of delivery method for production effort  or based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract under the cost to cost method for development effort 
the percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract 
the estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract 
these projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs and manufacturing efficiency 
these contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality 
sales and costs related to profitable purchase options are included in our estimates only when the options are exercised while sales and costs related to unprofitable purchase options are included in our estimates when exercise is determined to be probable 
sales related to change orders are included in profit estimates only if they can be reliably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable 
estimates of profit margins for contracts are typically reviewed by management on a quarterly basis 
assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and cost estimates  the combining of contracts or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised 
significant changes in estimates related to accounting for long term contracts may have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which the revised estimate is made 
deferred program investments we defer certain pre production engineering costs in inventories  net and record up front sales incentives in intangible assets collectively referred to as program investments 
these program investments are amortized over their estimated useful lives  up to a maximum of years 
estimated useful lives are limited to the amount of time we are virtually assured to earn revenues through a contractually enforceable right included in long term supply arrangements with our customers 
this provides the best matching of expense over the related period of benefit 
the following provides an overview of the program investments

september in millions pre production engineering costs up front sales incentives total program investments we defer the cost of certain pre production engineering costs incurred during the development phase of an aircraft program in connection with long term supply arrangements that contain contractual guarantees for reimbursement from customers 
these customer guarantees generally take the form of a minimum order quantity with quantified reimbursement amounts in the event the minimum order quantity is not taken by the customer 
these costs are deferred in inventories  net to the extent of the contractual guarantees 
pre production engineering costs in excess of the contractual guarantee and costs incurred pursuant to supply arrangements that do not contain customer guarantees for 
table of contents reimbursement are expensed as incurred 
the net book value of pre production engineering costs included in inventories  net was million and million at september  and  respectively 
these costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives  up to years  as a component of cost of sales 
we also provide up front sales incentives prior to delivering products or performing services to certain commercial customers in connection with sales contracts 
up front sales incentives are recorded as a customer relationship intangible asset and are amortized over their estimated useful lives  up to years 
up front sales incentives consisting of cash payments or customer account credits are amortized as a reduction of sales whereas incentives consisting of free products are amortized as cost of sales 
the net book value of incentives included in customer relationship intangible assets was million and million at september  and  respectively 
risks inherent in recovering the value of our program investments include  but are not limited to  the following changes in market conditions may affect product sales under a program 
in particular  the commercial aerospace market has been historically cyclical and subject to downturns during periods of weak economic conditions  which could be prompted or exacerbated by political or other domestic or international events 
bankruptcy or other significant financial difficulties of our customers 
our ability to produce products could be impacted by the performance of subcontractors  the availability of specialized materials and other production risks 
we evaluate the carrying amount of program investments for recovery at least annually or when potential indicators of impairment exist  such as a change in the estimated number of products to be delivered under a program 
no impairment charges related to program investments were recorded in  or while we believe our program investments are recoverable over time  the cancellation of a program by a customer would represent the most significant impairment factor related to program investments 
due to the long term nature of the procurement cycle and the significant investment to bring a program to market in the aerospace and defense industry  we believe the likelihood of a customer abruptly cancelling a program is remote 
we also evaluate our amortization of program investments on a quarterly basis based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis 
the impact of changes in expected delivery rates on the program investments amortization is adjusted as needed on a prospective basis 
there were no significant changes in the rate of program investment amortization in  and income taxes at the end of each quarterly reporting period  we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimate of our effective income tax rate involves significant judgments resulting from uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions  implementation of tax planning strategies and estimates as to the jurisdictions where income is expected to be earned 
these estimates may be further complicated by new laws  new interpretations of existing laws and rulings by taxing authorities 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of these underlying issues  our actual effective income tax rate and related tax liabilities may differ from our initial estimates 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known or as our estimates are revised based on additional information 
the resulting adjustment to our income tax expense could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period the adjustment is recorded 
a one percentage point change in our effective income tax rate would change our annual net income by approximately million 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for tax carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
management believes it is more likely than not that the current and long term deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income 
as part of the determination of our tax liability  management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating tax positions taken by us in determining the income tax provision and establishes reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with the income taxes

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below for further detail regarding unrecognized tax benefits  deferred taxes and the factors considered in evaluating deferred tax asset realization 
goodwill as of september   we had million of goodwill related to various business acquisitions 
we perform impairment tests on goodwill on an annual basis during the second quarter of each fiscal year  or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred 
goodwill is potentially impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit that contains the goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future discounted cash flows  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples  ratios and valuations of a set of comparable public companies within our industry 
the valuation methodology and underlying financial information that is used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units requires significant judgments to be made by management 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  the long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to present value future cash flows 
our five year strategic operating plan  adjusted for current market events such as the global economic downturn among others  serves as the basis for these valuations and represents our best estimate of future business conditions in our industry as well as our ability to compete 
discount rates are determined based upon the weighted average cost of capital for a set of comparable companies adjusted for risks associated with our different operations 
our goodwill impairment tests that were performed in the second quarter of  and yielded no impairments 
if there were a significant downturn in our business  we could incur a goodwill impairment 
warranty accrued liabilities are recorded on our consolidated statement of financial position to reflect our contractual obligations relating to warranty commitments to our customers 
we provide warranty coverage of various lengths and terms to our customers depending on standard offerings and negotiated contractual agreements 
we record an estimate for warranty expense at the time of sale based on historical warranty return rates and repair costs 
we believe our primary source of warranty risk relates to our ife products and also to extended warranty terms across all businesses 
at september   we have recorded million of warranty liabilities 
should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience  we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 
pension benefits we historically provided retirement benefits to most of our employees in the form of defined benefit pension plans 
accounting standards require the cost of providing these pension plans be measured on an actuarial basis 
these accounting standards will generally reduce  but not eliminate  the volatility of pension expense as actuarial gains and losses resulting from both normal year to year changes in valuation assumptions and the differences from actual experience are deferred and amortized 
the application of these accounting standards requires management to make numerous assumptions and judgments that can significantly affect these measurements 
critical assumptions made by management in performing these actuarial valuations include the selection of discount rates and expectations on the future rate of return on pension plan assets 
discount rates are used to determine the present value of our pension obligations and also affect the amount of pension expense recorded in any given period 
we estimate this discount rate based on the rates of return of high quality  fixed income investments with maturity dates that reflect the expected time horizon that benefits will be paid see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
changes in the discount rate could have a material effect on our reported pension obligations and related pension expense 

table of contents the expected rate of return is our estimate of the long term earnings rate on our pension plan assets and is based upon both historical long term actual and expected future investment returns considering the current investment mix of plan assets 
differences between the actual and expected rate of return on plan assets can impact our expense for pension benefits 
holding all other factors constant  the estimated impact on pension expense caused by hypothetical changes to key assumptions is as follows

the determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories 
valuation reserves for excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory that is unlikely to be sold above cost 
other factors that management considers in determining these reserves include overall market conditions and other inventory management initiatives 
management can generally react to reduce the likelihood of severe excess and slow moving inventory issues by changing purchasing behavior  although abrupt changes in market conditions can limit our ability to react quickly 
management believes its primary source of risk for excess and obsolete inventory is derived from the following our ife inventory  which tends to experience quicker technological obsolescence than our other products 
ife inventory at september  was million 
life time buy inventory  which consists of inventory that is typically no longer being produced by our vendors but for which we purchase multiple years of supply in order to meet production and service requirements over the life span of a product 
total life time buy inventory on hand at september  was million 
at september   we had million of inventory valuation reserves recorded on  million of total inventory on hand 
although management believes these reserves are adequate  any abrupt changes in market conditions may require us to record additional inventory valuation reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which these additional reserves are required 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in addition to using cash provided by normal operating activities  we utilize a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations 
our operating results and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates that could adversely affect the amount of interest expense incurred and paid on debt obligations in any given period 
in addition  changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of our debt obligations 
such changes in fair value are only relevant to the extent these debt obligations are settled prior to maturity 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt  and when considered necessary  we may employ financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to help meet this objective 
at september   we had million of percent fixed rate long term debt obligations outstanding with a carrying value of million and a fair value of million 
in we converted million of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt bearing interest at six month libor less basis points by executing receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swap contracts 
at september   we also had million of percent fixed rate long term debt obligations outstanding with a carrying value of million and a fair value of million 
a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would have decreased or increased the fair value of our long term debt  exclusive of the effects of the interest rate swap contracts  by million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the million notional value of interest rate swap contracts was an million asset at september  a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by million and million  respectively 
at september   we also had million of variable rate long term debt outstanding related to a non us subsidiary 
our results of operations are affected by changes in market interest rates related to variable rate debt 
inclusive of the effect of the interest rate swaps  a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would not have a material effect on operations or cash flows 
for more information related to outstanding debt obligations and derivative financial instruments  see notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
foreign currency risk we transact business in various foreign currencies which subjects our cash flows and earnings to exposure related to changes to foreign currency exchange rates 
we attempt to manage this exposure through operational strategies and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts foreign currency contracts 
all foreign currency contracts are executed with banks we believe to be creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
the majority of our non functional currency firm and anticipated receivables and payables are hedged using foreign currency contracts 
it is our policy not to manage exposure to net investments in non us subsidiaries or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts were million and million at september  and  respectively 
notional amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents at spot exchange rates at the respective dates 
principal currencies that are hedged include the european euro  british pound sterling and japanese yen 
the duration of foreign currency contracts is generally five years or less 
the net fair value of these foreign currency contracts was a net liability of million and a net asset of million at september  and  respectively 
a percent increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease or increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by million
