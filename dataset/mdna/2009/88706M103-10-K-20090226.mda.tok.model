item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  annual report 
all amounts are expressed in canadian dollars unless otherwise noted 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that are not historical facts but reflect our current expectation regarding future results 
actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties  including the matters discussed below 
please refer to risk factors included elsewhere in our annual report for a further description of risks and uncertainties affecting our business and financial results 
historical trends should not be taken as indicative of future operations and financial results 
our financial results are driven largely by changes in systemwide sales  which include restaurant level sales at both franchise and company operated restaurants 
as of december    or of our restaurants were franchised  representing in canada and in the united states 
the amount of systemwide sales affects our franchisee royalties and rental income  as well as our distribution sales 
changes in systemwide sales are driven by changes in average same store sales and changes in the number of restaurants 
average same store sales  one of the key metrics we use to assess our performance  provides information on total retail sales at restaurants operating systemwide throughout the relevant period and provides a useful comparison between periods 
we believe systemwide sales and average same store sales provide meaningful information to investors concerning the size of our system  the overall health and financial performance of the system  and the strength of our brand and franchisee base  which ultimately impacts our consolidated and segmented financial performance 
franchise restaurant sales generally are not included in our consolidated financial statements except for restaurants consolidated in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin r consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
revised december fin r  however  franchise restaurant sales result in royalties and rental income  which are included in our franchise revenues  and also impact distribution income 
commencing in december of  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of wendy s international inc wendy s  and our financial results were consolidated with those of wendy s and its other operating segments 
for our historical financial information  refer to the periodic and annual reports filed by wendy s 
in march  we completed an initial public offering ipo pursuant to which public stockholders purchased million shares  or  of our outstanding common stock 
wendy s continued to own of our outstanding shares after the ipo and  therefore  our financial results continued to be consolidated with wendy s until september  on september   wendy s completed a spin off of its remaining controlling stake in the company  representing approximately million shares of our common stock  by a special pro rata distribution of such shares to its stockholders of record on september  with the completion of this distribution  we have operated as a widely held  standalone public company since september we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
however this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may also contain certain non gaap financial measures to assist readers in understanding the company s performance 
non gaap financial measures are measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
where non gaap financial measures are used  we have provided the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and a reconciliation to gaap measures

table of contents executive overview we franchise  and to a lesser extent  operate tim hortons restaurants in canada and the us as the franchisor  we collect royalty income on our franchised restaurant sales 
our business model also includes controlling the real estate for most of our franchised restaurants 
as of december   we leased or owned the real estate for approximately of our system restaurants  which generates a recurring stream of rental income 
real estate that is not controlled by us is generally for non standard restaurants  including  for example  kiosks in offices  hospitals  colleges  and airports  as well as self serve kiosks located in gas and convenience locations and grocery stores 
we distribute coffee and other beverages  non perishable food  supplies  packaging and equipment to system restaurants in canada through our five distribution centres 
in the third quarter of  we completed the roll out of distribution of frozen and refrigerated products from our guelph facility  which services approximately of our ontario restaurants 
in the us  we supply similar products to system restaurants through third party distributors 
in addition to our canadian and us franchising business  we have licensed locations in the republic of ireland  northern ireland  and the united kingdom  which are mainly self serve kiosks operating primarily under the name tim hortons 
systemwide sales growth was in fiscal in fiscal  as a result of continued same store sales growth in canada and  to a lesser extent  in the us and new restaurant expansion in both canada and the us systemwide sales include restaurant level sales at both franchised and company operated restaurants 
total systemwide sales growth is determined using a constant exchange rate to exclude the effects of foreign currency translation 
us dollar sales are converted into canadian dollar amounts using the average exchange rate of the base year for the period covered 
in february  we outlined our targets which included same store sales growth  operating income growth  restaurant development and capital expenditure targets as well as guidance on our effective tax rate 
our same store sales growth in canada was  which was within our targeted range of to  and in the us  which was below our targeted range of to 
our operating income growth was which was below our targeted growth rate of 
in fiscal  we incurred costs related to restaurant closures and asset impairment of million discussed herein and incurred costs related to a management restructuring of million net of savings 
these charges were not contemplated at the time we set our operating income targets in february operating income growth for  excluding the impact of the asset impairment  closure costs and management restructuring charges was see reconciliation to us gaap operating income under selected operating and financial highlights below  just slightly below our targeted rate 
we opened restaurants in canada in  in line with our target of to restaurants  and we opened restaurants in the us  which was higher than our us opening target of to restaurants  primarily as a result of the higher number of self serve kiosks opened as part of a strategic alliance 
we spent million in capital expenditures in fiscal  which was below our targeted range of between million and million  primarily due to the higher number of self serve kiosks open and a higher number of leased versus owned properties 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal  which was slightly below the targeted range of between and 
fiscal same store sales increased in canada in fiscal  including approximately of pricing 
restaurant level price increases are primarily used to offset higher restaurant level costs on key items such as labour  coffee and other supplies  and utility costs 
frequency of visits moderated in canada over with pricing contributing the majority of our growth in the year 
our us same store sales increased in fiscal growth in fiscal  and we had approximately of pricing in fiscal  which  similar to our canadian experience  did not translate fully into sales growth 
offsetting the pricing impact were lower transactions in our us restaurants 
we also lapped strong prior year sales comparatives in both canada and the us consumer cost pressures  including high gasoline prices for part of the year  could have also been a contributing factor along with the weakening north american economy to the overall sales results for the year 
the fact that we did experience organic growth in canada  however  in these challenging economic times  demonstrates our price value position and our loyal customer base 
as a result of pricing implemented in fiscal  we currently expect that there will be approximately pricing impact in same store sales results in fiscal in both 
table of contents canada and the us versus the comparable period in  with the first quarter being higher 
price increases in both the us and canada do not necessarily translate into an equivalent level of sales growth  which largely depends on customer response to new pricing 
same store sales growth canada and us  was driven by our promotional calendar  new product offerings  continuous improvement at restaurant level operations  and price increases in some regions of canada and the us  as outlined above 
product innovation  such as the launch of specialty coffee in british columbia in late and manitoba  continues to be one of our focused strategies to drive same store sales growth  including innovation at breakfast as well as other day parts 
in  we will continue to focus our efforts on driving same store sales growth through our marketing and promotional activities  new product offerings including targeted day part offerings  and operational improvements  such as increased speed of service and enhancement of the overall customer experience 
over  there was significant global macro economic turmoil  with heightened deterioration in the us  especially in the back half of the year 
canada experienced weakness over the year to a lesser extent than the us  although current conditions in canada reflect market declines and challenging general business conditions overall in north america 
historically  we have proven to be fairly resilient in canada during challenging economic times due  in part  to our quality product offering at a reasonable price 
our fiscal earnings performance and positive same store sales growth in canada demonstrates our brand strength in canada in the face of unprecedented economic and consumer challenges 
our brand in the us is less developed in certain regions  and we faced sales and earnings challenges in our us segment due to the current economic conditions and continued intensive competitive activity 
throughout and current to  our competitors have focused on discounting  combo product offerings  and value pricing activities in both the us and in canada commencing in 
despite these challenges  we delivered a strong consolidated performance in the fourth quarter and year to date  excluding the asset impairment and related closure costs 
we are not immune to recessionary impacts  and we expect  overall  to see continued volatility quarter to quarter in the restaurant sector and continued challenges in the macro economic environment 
this challenging environment may result in continued pressure on customer visits in in the fourth quarter of  we announced that we would close up to underperforming company operated stores in southern new england between the end of or at the beginning of we have concluded the process by closing primarily company operated locations 
the closure of such underperforming restaurants was consistent with our efforts to improve profitability in the us as previously disclosed  the closure of these restaurants triggered an impairment review with respect to the remaining restaurants in the affected markets  which included providence  rhode island and hartford  connecticut 
an asset impairment charge of million was recorded for the remaining locations  which  combined with the restaurant closure costs for the closed restaurants of million  totaled million million on an after tax basis 
our operating income target did not contemplate this impairment and restaurant closure charge  or the management restructuring charge that occurred in the second quarter of we believe the restaurant closures will have a positive long term impact on the financial performance of the us operating segment and potentially benefit sales of surrounding restaurants 
we opened a total of restaurants in fiscal compared to restaurants in fiscal  including self serve kiosks self serve kiosks 
our restaurant development program is typically highest in the fourth quarter each year 
we execute our development activities prudently and only with what we believe to be the right opportunities 
in  we shifted our us restaurant development focus towards smaller restaurants  a higher mix of non standard units  including self serve kiosks as well as strategic alliances and co branding opportunities 
in  we will continue to focus our development of standard  full serve restaurants to targeted in our substantial regional markets in the us  such as new york  ohio  and michigan 
this growth will be complemented by non standard locations and sites from strategic alliances 
as mentioned above  we continue to pursue strategic alliances with third parties for restaurant development opportunities in the us and canada 
self serve kiosks leverage a tim hortons platform in place in 
table of contents locations in the convenience channel in the republic of ireland  northern ireland  and the united kingdom  and provide a new avenue for growth while increasing brand exposure 
our self serve kiosk units are included in our restaurant count for the us and canada  but are not expected to produce the same level of rents and royalties and distribution revenues as other non standard restaurants  and the financial arrangements with our strategic business partners for these ventures may differ from our other typical franchise models 
in fiscal  our revenues increased million  or  over fiscal these increases were primarily a result of continued average same store sales gains in canada and growth in the number of systemwide restaurants  resulting in higher royalty  rental and distribution revenues 
distribution represents of our total revenues and is the largest portion of our revenues 
distribution sales increased as a result of growth in system restaurants and well as the completion of our implementation of frozen and refrigerated distribution from our guelph  ontario facility in the third quarter of operating income increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of higher year over year revenues  discussed above 
operating income gains in fiscal were also realized from lower other expense  which was primarily related to certain foreign exchange gains in versus foreign exchanges losses in partially offsetting these operating gains were the asset impairment and related closure costs of million see below  higher operating expenses arising primarily from a higher number of properties that we own or lease and then sublease to franchisees  higher general and administrative expenses  lower equity income  and lower contribution from our us operating segment 
operating income growth excluding asset impairment and related closure costs of million and restructuring charges net of savings of million incurred in fiscal was refer to our us gaap reconciliation to operating income below 
in fiscal  our net income increased million  or  compared to fiscal the increase in net income was primarily a result of the higher operating income  partially offset by higher net interest expense and slightly higher income tax expense 
our net income growth rate of was higher than operating income growth of  due primarily to the lower effective tax rate in fiscal versus fiscal earnings per share increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding in fiscal was million  which was lower than the diluted weighted average share count in fiscal  primarily as a result of our share repurchase program 
as part of our vertical integration strategy  we plan to construct a new coffee roasting facility  which will be located in hamilton  ontario and has a planned opening in late we currently expect to invest approximately million in this facility  primarily in consistent with our vertical integration investment strategy  the new roasting facility will provide system benefits important to our franchisees and the company 
when fully operational  this facility  coupled with our existing coffee roasting operation in rochester  new york  will provide at least of our total coffee requirements 
equally important  our green coffee blending capability will help us protect the quality  integrity and supply of our proprietary coffee blend from bean to cup  at a very competitive rate for our franchisees and provide for a reasonable return on our investment 
we continue to selectively invest in growth opportunities for our business and believe our financial position is a key enabler of our future growth 
the company completed its second million share repurchase program on october  a total of approximately million shares were repurchased under the program  which commenced in november under our two share repurchase programs  we have repurchased a combined total of approximately million shares  representing approximately of shares outstanding at the time the initial share repurchase program was approved in november we plan to commence a previously approved million  twelve month share repurchase program in march timing of share purchases in the program will initially be solely at our discretion given prevailing market conditions  cost  and other considerations  unlike the previous program which included a b program 
the new program is subject to receipt of final regulatory approval  and represents a planned allocation of up to million  or a maximum of  of the company s outstanding shares at the time of regulatory approval 
the 
table of contents share repurchase program reflects the company s focus of creating value for shareholders and our strong cash flow and financial position 
if a subsequent decision is made to proceed with changes to the company s corporate structure see below  timing of share repurchases could be affected  including potentially deferring future purchases subsequent to the first quarter until after a transaction is implemented 
also with respect to returning value to our shareholders  consistent with our current dividend policy of paying a total of to of prior year  normalized annual net earnings in dividends each year  our board of directors approved a increase in the quarterly dividend to per share in february we paid dividends at this rate in march  june  september and december our board of directors has approved a further increase in the quarterly dividend to per share in february and declared a quarterly dividend at this new rate payable on march  to shareholders of record as of march  the payment of future dividends remains subject to the discretion of our board of directors 
since becoming a public company in march  we have declared and paid ten consecutive quarterly dividends  payable in canadian dollars 
in fiscal  we paid approximately million in dividends to our stockholders 
we commenced a review in the fourth quarter of  with the support of external advisors  to assess various opportunities related to our corporate structure 
this review is focused on tax and operational efficiencies and also addresses changes to the canada us tax treaty ratified in december of which  if not addressed  could negatively affect our effective tax rate 
this review was undertaken as a result of the expiry of time constraints under us tax rules and the tax sharing agreement we entered into at the time of our ipo that limited our ability to engage in certain acquisitions  reorganizations and other transactions that could have affected the tax free nature of the spin off from wendy s 
now that the time constraints have expired  we believe that opportunities may exist for us to achieve significant financial and other benefits from reorganizing our corporate structure  including potentially converting our parent company from a us to a canadian corporation 
based on the evaluations that we have conducted thus far  and which are ongoing  we believe that such an event would be in the best interest of our shareholders  driving long term value by bringing our effective tax rates closer to canadian statutory rates 
we would also expect to incur certain charges for discrete items  the majority of which would be non cash  and transactional costs in the year of implementation 
if we were to implement such a transaction in  the impact of the charges and costs would result in our targeted tax rate exceeding the identified range see targets and outlook  below and  potentially  could cause our targeted operating income to fall below the expected range 
benefits of the transaction would be expected to occur in and future years  as the effective tax rate would be expected to decline 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete a reorganization of our company or any other transaction for that matter or that the expected benefits will ultimately be realized  given the various assessments  conditions  and approvals that remain outstanding in connection with the initiatives described above 
targets and outlook in fiscal  we are targeting same store sales growth of to in canada and to in the us we have established these growth targets in a climate of challenging macro economic circumstances and competitive activities that might create variability quarter to quarter or potentially impede our ability to achieve these targets 
we continue to focus on growth strategies that have been successful in the past  including menu innovation and operational initiatives  such as our new cashless payment systems and improving speed of service  particularly in our drive thrus  and other activities which we believe will help offset the impact of these challenges  including offering combo pricing and product bundling promotions 
we also continue to look for efficiencies in our operations and help our franchisees to do the same at restaurant level 
we are also modifying our approach to restaurant development in light of the challenging economic times  including decreasing the size of our restaurants  pursuing strategic alliances and co branding opportunities 
in  we expect to open to restaurants in canada and to full serve restaurants in the us  complemented by non standard locations and strategic alliances  including co branding opportunities 
on a systemwide basis  we expect to close to restaurants in the normal course of our business 

table of contents we anticipate our total capital expenditures will be between million and million  including capital expenditures for new restaurant development  remodelling  technology initiatives and other capital needs  including our new coffee roasting facility discussed above 
we anticipate being able to fund these capital expenditures through free cash flow 
we are targeting operating income growth of to in over  to adjusting for the restaurant closure costs and asset impairment charge 
our operating income target includes a target of break even operating income performance for our us segment on a full year basis and assumes a gradual recovery in the north american economy in the back half of fiscal will have weeks which has approximately positive impact to operating income growth and is included in our target 
the cost of implementation of any potential restructuring transaction is excluded from this target 
we estimate that our effective tax rate will be between  subject to some quarterly variations  and subject to our implementation of a restructuring transaction see above 
these financial targets are for only 
these targets are forward looking and are based on our expectations and outlook and shall be effective only as of the date the targets were originally issued on february  except as required by applicable securities laws  we do not intend to update our annual financial targets 
these targets and our performance generally is subject to various risks and uncertainties risk factors which may impact future performance and our achievement of these targets

selected operating and financial highlights fiscal years systemwide sales growth average same store sales growth canada us systemwide restaurants revenues in millions operating income in millions adjusted operating income in millions net income in millions basic and diluted earnings per share weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding diluted in millions total systemwide sales growth is determined using a constant exchange rate to exclude the effects of foreign currency translation 
us dollar sales are converted into canadian dollar amounts using the average exchange rate of the base year for the period covered 
historically  in our us business  a restaurant was included in our average same store sales calculations beginning the th month after the restaurant s opening 
commencing in the first quarter of  we began calculating our canadian average same store sales growth on this basis as well 
this change aligned same store calculation methodologies between canada and the us and with current industry practices 
the canadian numbers set forth in the table above reflect recalculation of the historical numbers based on the new methodology 
the change in methodology for canada had a greater impact in historical years when we had higher new restaurant development activities relative to our lower historical total canadian restaurant count  as compared to more recent years when new restaurant development represented a smaller percentage of our overall canadian restaurant base 
the us methodology has not changed 
previously reported figures compared to the revised numbers noted above using the new methodology were disclosed in our first quarter form q filed on may  
table of contents adjusted operating income is a non gaap measure 
the presentation of this non gaap measure is made with operating income  the most directly comparable us gaap measure 
management believes that pro forma adjusted operating income information is important for comparison purposes to prior periods and for purposes of evaluating management s operating income performance compared to target for  which excludes asset impairment and related closure costs million and the management restructuring charges  net of savings million 
the asset impairment and related closure costs impacted two of our us operating markets  which represents a very small portion of our overall operations 
the adjustment is a more accurate assessment of our overall operating performance as it removes what we consider to be a disproportional impact of these markets on overall performance of our consolidated business 
we evaluate our consolidated business performance and trends excluding amounts related to such items 
therefore  this measure provides a more consistent view of management s perspectives on underlying performance than the closest equivalent us gaap measure 
fiscal years change from prior year fiscal years change from prior year reported operating income impairment and related closure costs n m restructuring  net of savings n m adjusted operating income systemwide sales growth our financial results are driven largely by changes in systemwide sales  which include restaurant level sales at both franchised and company operated restaurants  although approximately of our system is franchised 
the amount of systemwide sales impacts our franchisee royalties and rental income  as well as our distribution sales 
changes in systemwide sales are driven by changes in average same store sales and changes in the number of restaurants 
systemwide sales growth excludes sales from our republic of ireland  northern ireland  and united kingdom licensed locations as these locations operate on a significantly different business model compared to our north american operations 
average same store sales growth average same store sales  one of the key metrics we use to assess our performance  provides information on total retail sales at restaurants operating systemwide ie  includes both franchised and company operated restaurants throughout the relevant period and provides a useful comparison between periods 
our average same store sales growth is attributable to several key factors  including new product introductions  improvements in restaurant speed of service and other operational efficiencies  more frequent customer visits  expansion into broader menu offerings and pricing 
restaurant level price increases are primarily used to offset higher restaurant level costs on key items such as coffee  labour  supplies  utility and other costs

new product offerings have historically contributed significantly to same store sales growth 
new or enhanced products in included iced cappuccino supreme beverages  new soup selections  strawberry blossom donut  maple themed products  gourmet cookies  the breakfast belt  breakfast combos with hashbrowns  and iced coffee in the us in late  we also rolled out our specialty coffee program in british columbia  adding locations throughout manitoba and other locations

in addition to food items  tim hortons restaurants sell a variety of promotional products on a seasonal basis and also sell home coffee brewers  canned coffee  boxed teas  mugs  teapots  and other products throughout the year 
commencing in late in canada and in early in the us  the timcard was available for purchase 
additionally  in october  we launched the timshop  an e commerce platform  which currently serves canadian residents 
customers have access to order a range of items such as gift baskets  coffee brewers and travel mugs and our full canned beverage line up of coffee  teas  cappuccinos and hot chocolate online 
marketing and promotional activities are also designed to drive same store sales growth 
in  we began introducing targeted combo food programs at a variety of value points in response to the challenging economic environment  and we believe these programs reinforce our value proposition with us consumers and position us well to build transactions 
we have also started offering combo or product bundles to canadian customers in operational initiatives also contribute to sales growth 
our recent strategies include improved speed of service  particularly in our drive thrus  as well as enhancing our customer s overall dining experience inside our restaurants

table of contents new restaurant development opening restaurants in new and existing markets in canada and the us has been a significant contributor to our growth 
below is a summary of restaurant openings and closures for our   and fiscal years fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year standard and non standard self serve kiosks total standard and non standard self serve kiosks total standard and non standard self serve kiosks total canada restaurants opened restaurants closed net change us restaurants opened restaurants closed net change total company restaurants opened restaurants closed net change in our us segment  while our core strategy of developing standard restaurants remains unchanged  we have recently modified our restaurant development plan to include a higher proportion of our self serve kiosk platform and to expand our use of full serve non standard units in order to continue to seed our brand  both of which creates greater market penetration while being less capital intensive 
we believe that this approach ultimately will allow us to broaden brand awareness and convenience in a cost efficient manner 
as stated above  we will continue to develop standard restaurants as well  and we have targeted to restaurants  which will primarily be full service standard restaurant formats  over we will primarily target our substantial us regional markets such as new york  ohio and michigan for growth of standard restaurant locations  and we will adjust certain factors in our standard restaurant development  including reducing the size of our restaurants  which will better match the needs of our customers with the restaurant design while also creating efficiencies for our franchisees and us 
from the beginning of to the end of fiscal  we opened system restaurants including both franchised and company operated restaurants  net of restaurant closures 
typically  to system restaurants are closed annually  the majority of which are in canada 
restaurant closures typically result from an opportunity to acquire a better location  which will permit us to upgrade size and layout or add a drive thru 
restaurant closures made in the normal course typically occur at the end of a lease term or the end of the useful life of the principal asset 
we have also closed  and may continue to close  restaurants for which the restaurant location has performed below our expectations for an extended period of time  and or we believe that sales from the restaurant can be absorbed by surrounding restaurants 
in  we closed a total of restaurants  which was higher than our typical range of to system restaurants per year 
the restaurant closures included the closure costs associated with the closure of restaurants in the fourth quarter of in southern new england one additional restaurant was closed by february  for a total of closures in southern new england  outside of the normal course of operations  as a result of a strategic profitability review of our us operations 

table of contents the following table shows our restaurant count as of the end of fiscal  and and provides a breakdown of our company operated and franchised restaurants 
our system includes over  restaurants across canada and the us at december    restaurants  or  were franchised restaurants representing in canada and in the us systemwide restaurant count fiscal year canada company operated franchised self serve kiosks franchised standard and non standard total franchised us company operated franchised self serve kiosks franchised standard and non standard total franchised total system company operated franchised self serve kiosks franchised standard and non standard total franchised over the last few years  we have been actively converting many of our us company operated restaurants to operator agreements 
initially  after conversion  we may provide additional relief to the operator  and we may be required to consolidate these restaurants in accordance with fin r 
we believe that  in the long term  the franchising strategy generally provides better overall profitability to the company 
the effect of these conversions to date has been slightly accretive to operating income 
segment operating income loss systemwide sales and average same store sales growth are affected by the business and economic environments in canada and the us we manage and review financial results from canadian and us operations separately 
we  therefore  have determined the reportable segments for our business to be the geographic locations of canada and the us each segment includes all manufacturing and distribution operations that are located in their respective geographic locations 
we have started to develop international operations in the republic of ireland  northern ireland  and the united kingdom  primarily in the form of branded licensed self serve kiosk locations 
at this time  this business contributes nominal amounts to distribution sales and royalties revenues as well as to consolidated operating income and  as a result  these operations are included in corporate charges in our segmented operating results

n m the comparison is not meaningful 
fiscal compared to fiscal segment operating income increased million  or  in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal  and  as a percentage of total revenues  was and  respectively 
included in our segment operating income was million of asset impairment and related closure costs that were recorded in our us segment 
excluding the asset impairment and related closure costs  segment operating income would have increased million  or to million 
in addition  operating income as a percentage of total revenues would have been with underlying growth coming entirely from the canadian segment 
canada our canadian segment operating income increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal canadian segment operating income and margins benefited from an increase in systemwide sales  which includes sales from new restaurants  net of closures  and same store sales growth 
canadian same store sales growth was in fiscal  of which pricing accounted for approximately 
price increases are market driven  generally as a result of rising restaurant level costs  particularly labour costs  changes in commodity costs  and utility and other costs 
we typically expect price increases in one or more markets throughout a given year  however  there can be no assurance that price increases will result in an equivalent level of sales growth  which depends upon customer response to the new pricing 
in fiscal  we opened restaurants in canada and closed  compared to opening restaurants and closing in fiscal in  we will continue our focus on driving same store sales  including through new product offerings  marketing and promotional programs  and operational initiatives 

table of contents canadian systemwide sales growth drove higher rents and royalties income as well as higher income from our distribution business 
the distribution business also benefited from incremental income related to a full year of frozen and refrigerated product distribution from our guelph facility rollout completed in third quarter in addition to operational efficiencies realized at this facility during see below 
partially offsetting this growth was higher general and administrative expenses  due largely to additional headcount required to support the growth of our business  and lower equity income year over year primarily because fiscal included a discrete non cash tax benefit that was recognized by our bakery joint venture 
the guelph distribution facility commenced operations in the first quarter of in april  we started the transition to three channel delivery from this distribution centre 
three channel delivery has shelf stable  refrigerated and frozen product on the same truck 
this facility now services approximately of our ontario restaurants for shelf stable  refrigerated and frozen products 
during the phase in period for refrigerated and frozen distribution in and the first half of  we faced higher distribution costs without the full benefit of the new distribution revenues 
sales margins on frozen and refrigerated products are typically lower than for some of our other products but have contributed positively to our net income in fiscal and fiscal distribution is a critical element of our business model as it allows us to control costs to our franchisees and service our restaurants efficiently and effectively while contributing to our profitability 
us in  our us segment had an operating loss of million  compared to an operating loss of million in the significant increase in our us segment operating loss was primarily due to the million asset impairment and related closure costs recorded during the fourth quarter of see below 
excluding the asset impairment and related closure costs  our operating loss in the us segment would have been million  an increase of million over the loss 
higher relief provided to certain franchisees  particularly as we transition more company operated restaurants to franchisees or operator agreements  contributed to a higher operating loss 
partially offsetting these factors were improved rents and royalties revenues and distribution and manufacturing income derived from overall systemwide sales growth and lower losses from company operated restaurants as a result of the transition of company operated restaurants to franchisee or operator agreements 
we anticipate that our us segment operating income will continue to show volatility  quarter to quarter and year to year  as we expand our new unit growth  although our goal is break even operating income performance for fiscal on a full year basis 
when we enter new markets  average unit sales volumes for our franchisees may be lower than sales levels in our more established markets 
in addition  based on past experience  as we add new restaurants in developing markets  average unit sales growth for existing restaurants may be affected for a period of time until awareness of the brand improves and the market adjusts to the added convenience that new locations provide 
in certain situations  we provide relief of rents and royalties  and in some cases  relief for other operating costs  for a period of time to support these franchisees 
such relief offsets our rent and royalty revenues 
in developing markets  when we transition a restaurant from a company operated restaurant to either a full franchised restaurant or a restaurant governed by an operator agreement  we also generally provide relief to the franchisee for an initial period 
in response to some of the economic challenges  we may  from time to time  adjust certain factors in our restaurant development plan  including items such as size or type of restaurant or timing and number of openings  and we will maintain a disciplined approach to new restaurant development 
as the state of the us economy deteriorated fairly rapidly  we made some refinements to our us business approach in the latter half of as part of our evolving response to the current economic climate 
we leveraged our self serve kiosk platform and expanded our use of full serve non standard units to continue to seed our brand  creating greater market penetration while being less capital intensive 
we also continue to look at other strategic development opportunities to grow the business  including co branding 
this approach ultimately allows us to broaden brand awareness and convenience in a more capital efficient manner 
we have also adapted our marketing and promotional activities to the challenging economic environment and related circumstances 
we have seen a high amount of competitive discounting and  as a result  we have 
table of contents introduced targeted combo food programs at a variety of value price points  with the intent to strengthen and build on our price value position and enhance this message with us and canadian consumers in a tangible way 
while we do not intend to stray from our core everyday positioning of quality food at reasonable prices  we are working with our franchisees to communicate and interact with customers in a manner that responds to their current situation and the economic environment 
we believe that these business refinements will help  over time  to position our us business to defend aggressive competitive discounting activity  while also creating sales momentum 
in the fourth quarter of  we began a strategic review of the us operations  including a profitability review 
as part of this review  we made the decision to close restaurants in two southern new england markets  of which were closed in december and one was closed by february  these closures resulted in restaurant closure costs of million  primarily consisting of lease termination costs and asset impairment costs 
as previously disclosed  the closure of these restaurants also triggered an impairment review relating to the two affected markets  which resulted in an impairment charge of million related to the remaining assets in these markets 
these costs  totaling million  have been recorded in the consolidated statement of operations under asset impairment and related closure costs 
we expect the rationalization of these underperforming restaurants will ultimately contribute to improved profitability and potentially improve sales performance at our remaining restaurants nearby 
these closures were also intended to help position the us business to achieve break even operating income performance by year end on a full year basis 
in considering our ability to achieve this objective for  we have assumed that a gradual recovery in the us economy will occur later in the year 
we will continue to implement various strategies and initiatives  including those discussed above  in order to work toward achieving our goal of break even operating income performance in  on a full year basis 
if  however  these strategies are not successful or we otherwise experience difficulties in achieving these targets  we may need to close additional restaurants  which  in turn  may lead to an additional impairment review and potential charges in fiscal or future years 
during fiscal  we opened new restaurants  including self serve kiosks  and closed restaurants in the us  as compared to opening new restaurants  including self serve kiosks  and closing restaurants in fiscal our restaurant openings included self serve kiosks  of which were part of a strategic alliance with tops friendly markets and are located in tops stores in western and central new york  and northern pennsylvania 
our restaurant openings included self serve kiosks  which were part of a strategic alliance with an operator of a national gasoline retailer in the us as a result of the foregoing growth  we achieved our target of having restaurants operating in the us by the end of fiscal  with the opening of our th restaurant in detroit in the fourth quarter 
we ended the year with restaurants  and we believe we have now achieved a critical mass of restaurants in the us sufficient to position us toward improved profitability of the us segment 
pricing did not fully translate into sales growth for our us segment in as same store sales increased  while pricing represented approximately of this growth  the net impact of which was essentially flat sales growth for despite the pricing increases for the year 
we typically expect price increases in one or more regions during the course of the year  but there can be no assurance that price increases will result in an equivalent level of sales growth  which depends upon customer response to the new pricing and potentially other macro economic challenges 
sales growth achievement is more challenging in certain us markets where we are less developed 
we believe that the current economic environment and intense competitive activity has resulted in a decline in transactions in our us operating segment 
additionally  in  we continued to focus on building up our franchise base by transitioning a number of our company operated restaurants to franchise or operator agreements 
this shift was part of our longer term strategy  which we have now substantially achieved  of having a primarily franchised system model  similar to our canadian operations 
at the end of  approximately of our us restaurants were franchised compared to at the end of our historical experience indicates that franchised restaurants are more successful for the franchisee  and therefore us  over the long term 
while transitioning company restaurants to 
table of contents franchise or operator agreements usually results in an initial increase in franchisee relief  particularly in our newer markets  and may increase the number of restaurants that we are required to consolidate in accordance with fin r  this increase in relief is typically less than the operating loss we incur from operating the restaurants corporately resulting in a net slightly positive benefit to our us segment 
we are typically able to identify franchisees for new restaurants  but in certain developing markets  it may be more challenging  however  it has not historically been a major impediment to our growth 
despite the current economic climate and credit conditions  our franchisees continue to have access to lending programs with third party lenders  although processing may take longer and costs may be higher  consistent with prevailing market conditions 
we are also beginning to experience a higher number of past due notes under our franchise incentive program 
in the event of default  we would take back ownership of the restaurant and equipment  which effectively collateralizes the note and  therefore  minimizes our risk 
corporate charges corporate charges include certain overhead costs that are not allocated to individual business units and the impact of certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
corporate charges were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the million decrease reflects the costs associated with the franchisee convention which did not recur in  and we had certain foreign exchange gains in versus foreign exchange losses in the comparable period of in addition  we had lower printing and mailing costs due to our adoption of the sec s new notice and access model for the provision of proxy materials to shareholders through posting at a dedicated website where shareholders can view the information and vote on line  as opposed to required printing and mailing of all materials to all of our shareholders 
partially offsetting these lower costs was a restructuring charge  net of savings  of million incurred in and higher professional fees associated with a review of the corporate structure of the company 
the company  through a wholly owned irish subsidiary  has launched self serve kiosks in certain licensed locations within convenience stores in the republic of ireland  northern ireland  and the united kingdom 
the self serve kiosks  which feature our premium coffee  tea  specialty hot beverages and a selection of donuts and muffins  were tested and introduced in the first half of as of december   there were self serve kiosks in licensed locations in the republic of ireland  northern ireland and in the united kingdom  primarily operating under the tim hortons brand 
these kiosks are operated by independent licensed retailers 
at present  the distribution of coffee and donuts through licensed locations with respect to these self serve kiosks is not a material contributor to our net income  although it will result in incremental warehouse sales and royalties 
our financial arrangements for these self serve kiosks are different than our traditional franchise models  and we may not  therefore  collect similar data or include these locations in certain of our metrics  including systemwide and same store sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal segment operating income increased million  or  for fiscal over our canadian segment operating income increased by million  or 
canadian average same store sales increased over the prior year  of which pricing contributed of this increase 
we opened new system restaurants in and closed restaurants 
overall  our total segment operating income from our reportable segments was and as a percentage of total revenues for the fiscal years and  respectively 
the overall margin decline was driven primarily by reduced profitability in our us business 
in  our us operating segment had an operating loss of million  compared to operating income of million 
the decrease in the us segment operating income was primarily due to the following factors increased relief given to franchisees  particularly as we transition more company operated restaurants to franchise or operator agreements  higher general and administrative expenses  as resources have been added to replace services previously provided by wendy s  lower income from coffee roasting operations  due primarily to foreign exchange fluctuations in the first quarter that are not expected to recur  lower franchise fee income  due primarily to the timing of revenue recognition from our franchise incentive program  and higher company operated restaurant losses 
us average same store sales growth was in  of which pricing contributed of this increase 

table of contents in fiscal  we opened restaurants in the us and closed restaurants 
our restaurant openings included self serve kiosks  which were part of a strategic alliance with an operator of a national gasoline retailer in the us in  we continued to reduce our us company operated restaurant base from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal this shift is part of our longer term strategy of having a primarily franchised system model  similar to our canadian operations 
particularly in our newer markets in the us  the progression to our franchise based model has initially resulted in higher franchise support costs  primarily in the area of rents  royalties and other relief and may increase the number of restaurants that we are required to consolidate in accordance with fin r 
corporate charges primarily include certain overhead costs that are not allocated to individual business units and the impact of certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
corporate charges were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the million increase reflects a year over year change in foreign exchange expense due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar  higher costs associated with our franchisee convention  higher standalone company costs and general growth in our business  partially offset by lower restricted stock unit expenses  and lower costs because the spin off from wendy s in did not recur in  including the costs of a run off directors and officers liability insurance policy 
as of december   there were self serve kiosk locations in certain licensed locations in the republic of ireland and in the united kingdom 
the operating income from these combined international operations was trivial in fiscal nil 
our financial arrangements for these self serve kiosks are different than our traditional franchise models  and we may not  therefore  collect similar data or include these locations in certain of our metrics  including same store sales 
our relationship with wendy s in march  we entered into various agreements with wendy s that defined our relationship in the interim period between our ipo and our separation from wendy s  as well as with respect to various post separation matters 
these agreements included a master separation agreement  a shared services agreement  a tax sharing agreement and a registration rights agreement  the latter of which effectively expired upon the spin off from wendy s 
in  we used information technology services from wendy s relating to our general ledger and us fixed asset repository system 
charges for these services totalled million in and were based on the charges outlined in the shared services agreement  which reduced as the required service levels declined 
we terminated all services from wendy s under the agreement in december after the implementation of our own standalone general ledger and us fixed asset repository system  although selected provisions of the agreement survive termination  including certain indemnification and limitation of liability clauses 
commencing with the implementation of our new systems  our general and administrative costs include depreciation and other costs for hosting and support services for our new general ledger and fixed asset repository 
in  we incurred million of expense allocations based on the provisions of the shared services agreement with wendy s  excluding costs related to wendy s restricted stock units 
we were a wholly owned subsidiary of wendy s for many years  and as such  we and wendy s historically shared many internal administrative resources 
the shared services agreement was designed to help us and wendy s transition to being two separate public companies  each with its own administrative resources 
under the shared services agreement  prior to september  wendy s provided us services relating to corporate functions such as executive oversight  risk management  internal audit  information technology  accounting  legal  investor relations  human resources  tax  employee benefits and incentives and other services 
consistent with the terms of the shared services agreement  the charges in fiscal and were reduced to reflect the increasing independence of the company and  therefore  the decreased level of services being provided by wendy s  primarily in the areas of executive oversight  investor relations  treasury  financial reporting and information systems 
we considered these general corporate expense allocations  as adjusted pursuant to agreement by wendy s and us as just described  to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of 
table of contents services provided 
the allocations may not  however  reflect the expense we would have incurred as a standalone public company for the same or similar services 
prior to entering into the shared services agreement with wendy s in  estimates of the benefits of similar services received in were carved out for comparative financial reporting purposes 
we also continue to have some interdependencies with wendy s with respect to income taxes see income taxes 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal below is a summary of comparative results of operations and a more detailed discussion of results for fiscal and financial definitions can be found immediately following liquidity and capital resources 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal change from prior year of revenues of revenues in thousands  except where noted revenues sales franchise revenues rents and royalties franchise fees total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales operating expenses franchise fee costs general and administrative expenses equity income asset impairment and related closure costs   n m other income expense  net   n m total costs and expenses  net operating income interest expense interest income income before income taxes income taxes net income n m the comparison is not meaningful 
rents and royalties revenues consist of i royalties  which typically range from to of gross franchise restaurant sales and ii rents  which consist of base and percentage rent in canada and percentage rent only in the us  and typically range from to of gross franchise restaurant sales 
franchise restaurant sales are reported to us by our franchisees 
franchise restaurant sales are not included in our consolidated financial statements  other than approximately and restaurants on average in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  whose results of operations are consolidated with ours pursuant to 
table of contents fin r 
franchise restaurant sales do  however  result in royalties and rental income  which are included in our franchise revenues  as well as distribution income 
the reported franchise restaurant sales were fiscal years franchise restaurant sales canada in thousands of canadian dollars us in thousands of us dollars revenues sales in fiscal  sales were  million  representing an increase of million  or  over fiscal our sales include warehouse sales  sales from company operated restaurants  and sales from restaurants required to be consolidated under fin r 
warehouse sales increased million  or  driven in part by million in incremental sales from the rollout of frozen and refrigerated products from our guelph distribution centre 
the rollout was completed in the third quarter of and  therefore  primarily influenced warehouse sales growth during the first half of another significant contribution to warehouse sales growth during fiscal was underlying product demand associated with systemwide sales growth  which reflects sales from a higher number of restaurants and higher same store sales 
systemwide sales growth  excluding pricing impacts  represented approximately million of total warehouse sales growth 
in addition  higher warehouse sales and corresponding costs see below were also driven by new products managed through our supply chain  representing approximately million of the increase 
partially offsetting these growth factors were some sales related to specific programs  such as the uniform rollout  that did not recur in the remainder of warehouse sales growth is attributable to a combination of changes in product mix and pricing 
distribution sales represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal compared to of our revenues in fiscal this change in revenues mix has an impact on overall margins since margins on some frozen and refrigerated products are lower than other products we distribute  but contribute positively to our operating income 
company operated restaurant sales were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of company operated restaurants in in  we operated  on average  company operated restaurants compared to company operated restaurants in on occasion  we may open more company operated restaurants when we enter new markets  and we may also repurchase restaurants from existing franchisees and then refranchise these restaurants 
as such  company operated revenue is impacted by the type of restaurant standard or non standard and the timing of these events throughout the year 
in addition  we closed company operated restaurants in the fourth quarter of in our southern new england markets and recorded restaurant closure costs and an impairment charge related to these markets see below 
during fiscal  we have transitioned many of our us company operated restaurants to either franchise or operator agreements 
while this may have the effect of lowering our sales from company operated restaurants  many of these restaurants meet the criteria set out in fin r  thus requiring us to consolidate most of these restaurants under these rules and  therefore  consolidate their sales 
as a result  we have increased the number of restaurants consolidated under fin r see below 
in addition  restaurants operating under operator agreements often qualify for increased financial support  primarily in the area of rent and royalties relief see franchise revenues below 
the consolidation of and restaurants  on average  during fiscal and under fin r resulted in an increase in sales of million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
while the us dollar exchange rate experienced significant volatility during the fourth quarter of  the average exchange rate for fiscal was not significantly different than the average exchange rate for fiscal therefore  the value of reported sales for would have been approximately higher had there been no exchange rate movement 

table of contents franchise revenues rents and royalties 
revenues from rents and royalties increased million  or  in fiscal over which was fairly consistent with the fiscal systemwide sales growth of 
as new restaurants open and average same store sales at existing restaurants increase  both our royalty and rental revenues increase because these are typically both based  in whole or part  on a percentage of sales 
the canadian segment contributed substantially all of this growth with million of overall growth related to positive same store sales growth and million related to the net addition of new restaurants in the system year over year 
the us segment experienced rents and royalties growth in excess of us systemwide sales growth due to a shift from company operated restaurants to operator agreements 
higher growth in the us was reduced to a large extent by higher relief provided to certain of our us franchisees  due in part from the shift towards operator agreements as well as a result of the challenging economic times many of our franchisees faced in franchise fees 
franchise fees include the sales revenue from initial equipment packages  as well as fees to cover costs and expenses related to establishing a franchisee s business 
in the us  we have a franchise incentive program whereby revenue and related costs from the sale of initial equipment packages is deferred until the franchise restaurant has exceeded and maintained certain sales volume levels and other recognition criteria 
this incentive program impacts the timing of revenue recognized on these franchise sales see the application of critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
franchise fees of million during fiscal were essentially unchanged from fiscal in  we opened a total of standard and non standard restaurants  excluding self serve kiosks  compared to standard and non standard restaurants openings in non standard restaurants include kiosks and locations in gas and convenience locations  hospitals  grocery stores  universities and office buildings and typically have lower initial franchise fees 
in addition  we opened self serve kiosks in compared to self serve kiosks in while self serve kiosks represented a disproportionate amount of overall unit growth in fiscal  they did not represent a significant portion of franchise fees as the franchise fees related to these units are significantly lower than franchise fees for full serve standard and non standard restaurants due primarily to the size of the equipment package required 
additionally  although the franchise fees reflect a higher number of restaurant openings in  they were offset by lower revenues from resales and replacements 
a replacement restaurant refers to a site change that results in a rebuild generally within a one kilometer radius and typically generates a new franchise fee 
we also had lower franchise fee revenues in the us in as a result of the revenue recognition criteria for our franchise incentive program  referenced above 
franchise revenues from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
while the us dollar exchange rate experienced significant volatility during the fourth quarter of  the average exchange rate for fiscal was not significantly different than the average exchange rate for fiscal therefore  the value of reported rents and royalties for would have been approximately higher had there been no exchange rate movement 
franchise fee revenues are not earned evenly throughout the year  and for the us business  depend largely on the revenue recognition criteria mentioned previously 
as a result  franchise fee revenues for fiscal would have been lower had there not been a change in the foreign exchange rates in effect at the time these revenues were recognized 
total costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales was  million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal our cost of sales includes warehouse cost of sales  cost of sales from company operated restaurants  and cost of sales from restaurants required to be consolidated under fin r 
this increase was primarily driven by an increase in warehouse cost of sales of million  or  during the year 
of this increase  million was due to the increased cost of product and operating costs from the rollout of frozen and refrigerated distribution from our guelph facility 
product demand from systemwide sales growth represented approximately 
table of contents million due to an increase in the number of restaurants opened and same store sales increases 
in addition  cost of sales increased million due to new products being managed through our supply chain 
partially offsetting this growth were certain items included in warehouse cost of sales in that did not recur in  such as the uniform rollout 
the remainder of cost of sales growth was the result of a combination of product mix and cost increases 
distribution cost of sales represented of our total costs and expenses in fiscal as compared to of our total costs and expenses in fiscal our distribution business will continue to be subject to changes related to the underlying costs of key commodities  such as coffee and sugar 
these cost changes can impact warehouse revenues  costs and margins  and can create volatility quarter over quarter and year over year 
increases and decreases in commodity costs are largely passed through to franchisees  resulting in higher or lower revenues and higher or lower costs of sales from our distribution business 
these changes may impact margins as many of these products are typically priced based on a fixed dollar mark up 
see commodity risks below 
company operated restaurant cost of sales  which includes food  paper  labour and occupancy costs  varies with the average number and mix eg  size  location  standard or non standard of company operated restaurants 
these costs decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of fewer company operated restaurants  on average  during the year 
the consolidation of and restaurants  on average  under fin r during fiscal and  respectively  resulted in cost of sales of million and million  respectively 
cost of sales of fin r restaurants were impacted by restaurant mix eg size  location  standard or non standard and foreign exchange rates 
cost of sales from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
while the us dollar exchange rate experienced significant volatility during the fourth quarter of  the average exchange rate for fiscal was not significantly different than the average exchange rate for fiscal therefore  the value of reported cost of sales for would have been approximately higher had there been no exchange rate movement 
operating expenses total operating expenses  representing primarily rent expense  depreciation and property costs  increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  representing an increase of 
the increase was mainly due to the increased number of restaurant openings and higher variable rent on existing properties due to sales growth  primarily in the canadian business 
rent expense and other property costs  as well as support costs  increased in fiscal as a result of additional properties being leased and then subleased to franchisees since december  rent expense also increased due to higher percentage rent costs on certain properties where we pay percentage rent  resulting from increased restaurant sales 
in addition  depreciation expense was higher as the total number of properties owned or leased by us in canada and the us  and then subleased to franchisees  increased by properties to  compared to  such properties in fiscal operating expenses will also increase as a result of higher depreciation expense from a higher number of system restaurants 
systemwide sales increases will also increase future operating expenses due to higher rent on variable rate leases and other factors 
operating expenses from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
while the us dollar exchange rate experienced significant volatility during the fourth quarter of  the average exchange rate for fiscal was not significantly different than the average exchange rate for fiscal therefore  the value of reported operating expenses for would have been approximately higher had there been no exchange rate movement 

table of contents franchise fee costs franchise fee costs include costs of equipment sold to franchisees as part of the commencement of their restaurant business  as well as training and other costs necessary to ensure a successful restaurant opening 
franchise fee costs of million were essentially flat from fiscal  consistent with the change in franchise fee revenues noted above 
higher standard and non standard franchise sales were offset in part by a lower number of resales and replacements as well as fewer franchise sales recognized in the us due to the recognition criteria mentioned earlier 
while overall restaurant openings were significantly higher than fiscal  much of this growth was primarily from self serve kiosks which typically have lower franchise fee costs than traditional standard and non standard locations 
in addition  increased support costs generally associated with establishing and or developing our franchised restaurants  increased year over year franchise fee costs 
franchise fee costs from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting our consolidated results 
franchise fee costs are not incurred evenly throughout the year and for the us and depend largely on the revenue recognition criteria mentioned previously 
as a result  franchise fee costs for fiscal would have been lower had there not been a change in the foreign exchange rates in effect at the time these revenues were recognized 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support current operations and provide the infrastructure to support future growth 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased marginally from in to in our objective is for general and administrative expense growth not to exceed revenue growth revenue growth was in fiscal 
there can be quarterly fluctuations in general and administrative expenses due to timing of recurring expenses or certain other events that may impact growth rates in any particular quarter 
general and administrative expenses increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the higher expense was the result of increased salaries and benefit expenses due to additional employees required to support the growth of the business  a restructuring charge  net of savings  of million see below  and higher professional fees associated with a review of the corporate structure of the company  mentioned previously 
partially offsetting these higher expenses were costs associated with the franchisee convention did not recur in on april   we announced changes to our executive management structure to both strengthen and streamline executive oversight of key business operations 
in addition  certain employees left the organization under various retirement and other arrangements 
a restructuring charge of million was recorded in the second quarter of in general and administrative expense relating to these retirement and other arrangements 
the restructuring yielded net savings in the second half of of approximately million  for a net reduction in fiscal operating results attributable to these charges of million 
our human resource and compensation committee committee changed the long term incentive or equity compensation program in for our named executive officers  as follows i we continued to issue restricted stock units  but they were conditional on the achievement of performance objectives over the prior fiscal year p rsus  and ii we commenced an option program with linked or tandem stock appreciation rights sars 
p rsus and options sars were granted in may we expect future grants will be in may of each year  subject in each case to the discretion of the committee 
stock based compensation costs  which are included in general and administrative expenses  were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily a result of the having more grants outstanding for the majority of  vesting on average over a month period  except for the immediate expensing of rsu grants for retirement eligible employees 

table of contents our us segment general and administrative expense is denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting our consolidated results 
while the us dollar exchange rate experienced significant volatility during the fourth quarter of  the average exchange rate for fiscal was not significantly different than the average exchange rate for fiscal therefore  the value of reported general and administrative expenses for would have been approximately higher had there been no exchange rate movement 
equity income equity income relates to income from equity investments in joint ventures and other investments over which we exercise significant influence 
our two most significant equity investments are our joint venture with iaws which provides our system with par baked donuts  timbits  bread products  and most recently  pastries  and our timwen partnership  which leases canadian tim hortons wendy s combination restaurants to both tim hortons and wendy s restaurants of canada inc in fiscal  equity income was million  representing a decrease of million from fiscal operating gains at our timwen partnership were essentially offset by lower income at our bakery joint venture primarily as a result of a discrete  non cash tax benefit of million recognized by our bakery joint venture in that did not recur  plus the impact of higher commodity costs  and commissioning costs for a new pastry line that was put into operation during the first quarter of the new pastry line began servicing system restaurants in a phased in approach during the second quarter of as we have previously disclosed  we do not expect that our equity income will necessarily grow at the same rate as our systemwide sales as it is not representative of all the components of our business 
for instance  our bakery joint venture provides bakery products which do not necessarily have the same growth rate as total systemwide sales 
in  we expect commodity costs to increase  however  at this time  we do not anticipate that these cost increases will be passed along to franchisees 
this is one of the ways we are helping to support our franchisees during these challenging economic times 
this will affect the profitability at our bakery joint venture 
as well  our timwen partnership is expected to grow at a slower rate as we are unlikely to add properties to this venture in the future 
asset impairment and related closure costs as part of a strategic review of the us operations  including a profitability review  we made the decision to close restaurants in two southern new england markets  the majority being company operated restaurants  of which were closed in december and one was closed by february  in total  asset impairment and related closure costs of million were recorded in the fourth quarter of of which million related to the restaurant closures and million related to an asset impairment relating to the restaurants that continue to operate in the two affected markets 
we expect the rationalization of these underperforming restaurants will ultimately contribute to improved profitability  and potentially improve sales performance at our remaining restaurants nearby 
other income and expense  net other income and expense  net  includes amounts that are not directly derived from our primary businesses 
this includes gains and losses on asset sales  other asset write offs  foreign exchange gains and losses and minority interest of variable interest entities consolidated in accordance with fin r 
in fiscal  other expense  net  was million versus million of other expense  net  in fiscal the million net decrease was primarily a result of foreign exchange gains in as opposed to foreign exchange losses in primarily related to foreign currency net asset positions 
foreign currencies strengthened substantially in late as opposed to weakening substantially in interest expense total interest expense  including interest on our credit facilities  was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase of million was primarily a result of higher interest on additional capital leases  partially offset by lower effective interest rates on our term debt 

table of contents interest income interest income was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease of million was primarily a result of lower overall rates of return on investments and lower overall non restricted cash balances  which were partially offset by interest earned on restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted investments relating to our timcard 
interest earned on restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted investments of million in fiscal was contributed to our advertising and promotion fund 
the contribution is recorded in general and administrative expense 
income taxes the effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared to in  and slightly below our targeted range of between and 
the variance is primarily explained by the reduction in canadian federal statutory rates and withholding tax rates in  offset by increases to valuation allowances relating to us deferred tax assets 
we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately to in  although some volatility may be experienced between quarters  and this rate is subject to change if we implement a restructure transaction  discussed previously and below 
the determination of income tax expense takes into consideration amounts that may be needed to cover exposure for open tax years 
the canada revenue agency is currently conducting an examination of various canadian subsidiaries of the company for and subsequent taxation years 
the internal revenue service has concluded its examination of the wendy s consolidated tax group for the year which includes the company up to september  we do not currently expect any material impact on earnings to result from the resolution of matters related to open tax years  however  actual settlements may differ from amounts accrued 
under us tax rules and the tax sharing agreement that we entered into at the time of our ipo  for a limited period of time we were not able to engage in certain acquisitions  reorganizations and other transactions that could affect the tax free nature of the spin off under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
these time constraints have now expired 
we are currently assessing and will continue to assess during the first two quarters of initiatives that may be available to us relating to our corporate structure and implications of the fifth protocol of the canada united states income tax convention  ratified in december by the canadian and us governments  including potentially reorganizing to become a canadian public company 
based on our evaluation undertaken to date  we believe that if we were to reorganize as a canadian public company  we would also expect to incur certain charges for discrete tax items  the majority of which would be non cash  and transactional costs in the year of implementation 
strategic  operational  and tax benefits of such a transaction would be expected to occur in and future years  including an expected decline in our effective tax rate toward canadian statutory rates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete a reorganization of our company or any other transaction for that matter  or that the expected benefits will ultimately be realized 
commencing in  if we maintain the current organizational structure  the impact of the protocol will result in the company s effective tax rate increasing in excess of 
we are party to a tax sharing agreement with wendy s  as subsequently amended on november  amended tax sharing agreement  which sets forth the principles and responsibilities of wendy s and us regarding the allocation of taxes  audits and other tax matters relating to periods when we were part of the same us federal consolidated or state and local combined tax filing group 
the agreement is applicable for all taxation periods up to september  commencing september   we became a standalone public company and  as a result  we file all us tax returns independently from wendy s from that date forward 
either we or wendy s may be required to reimburse the other party for the use of tax attributes while we filed us consolidated or state and local combined returns  as a result of audits or similar proceedings giving rise to adjustments to previously filed returns  in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
as several years remain open to review and adjustment by canadian taxation authorities  payments may be made by one party to the other for the use of the other party s tax attributes 
no payments were made by either party to the other under this agreement during fiscal

the reported franchise restaurant sales were fiscal years franchise restaurant sales canada in thousands of canadian dollars us in thousands of us dollars revenues sales in fiscal  sales were  million  an increase of million  or  over fiscal our sales include warehouse sales  sales from company operated restaurants  and sales from restaurants required to be consolidated under fin r 
warehouse sales increased million  or  driven primarily by a million increase due to a higher number of restaurants opened and same store sales increases 
the distribution of frozen and refrigerated products increased warehouse sales by million in as compared to product mix and price increases also contributed to the higher distribution revenues 
the impact of foreign exchange on the translation of our us business partially offset these increases see below 
distribution sales represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal compared to of our revenues in fiscal this change in revenues mix has an impact on overall margins since margins on frozen and refrigerated products are lower than some of the other products we distribute  but contribute positively to our operating income 
company operated restaurant sales were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of company operated restaurants in in  on average  we operated company restaurants compared to company operated restaurants in on occasion  we may open more company operated restaurants when we enter new markets  and we may also repurchase restaurants from existing franchisees and then refranchise these restaurants 
as such  company operated revenue is impacted by the type of restaurant standard or non standard and the timing of these events throughout the year 
during fiscal  we have transitioned many of our us company operated restaurants to either franchise or operator agreements 
while this may have the effect of lowering our sales from company operated restaurants  many of these restaurants meet the criteria set out in fin r  thus requiring us to consolidate some of these restaurants under these rules 
as a result  we have increased the number of restaurants consolidated under fin r see below 
in addition  restaurants operating under operator agreements often qualify for increased support  primarily in the area of rent and royalties relief see franchise revenues below 
the consolidation under fin r of and restaurants  on average  during fiscal and resulted in sales of million and million  respectively 
sales from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our results 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during fiscal reduced the value of reported sales by approximately compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement 

table of contents franchise revenues rents and royalties 
revenues from rents and royalties increased million  or  in fiscal over and are consistent with the systemwide sales growth of 
our net growth in both rental income and royalty income is driven primarily by a million increase due to the positive average same store sales growth over this time period and an increase of million from the addition of a net of system restaurants 
as mentioned previously  stronger same store sales growth was driven by new product offerings  our promotional calendar  continuous improvement in store level operations and some price increases 
price increases are typically used to offset higher costs at the restaurant level  typically for labour and food costs 
as new restaurants open and average same store sales at existing restaurants increase  both our royalty and rental income from franchisees increase because these are typically both based on a percentage of sales 
higher rent and royalty relief provided to certain us and canadian franchisees impacted rents and royalties revenues during the year 
franchise fees 
franchise fees during fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the year over year increase is primarily attributable to franchise fees generated from higher resales  replacements and renovations of million 
a replacement refers to a site change that results in a rebuild within a one kilometer radius and typically generates a new franchise fee 
in addition  in the us  we have a franchise incentive program whereby franchise fee revenues are deferred until the franchise restaurant has exceeded and maintained certain sales volume levels and other recognition criteria 
this incentive program impacts the timing of revenue recognition of franchise fees and impacted franchise fee revenues in we opened restaurants in as compared to restaurants in we opened a higher number of non standard restaurants in the us in  including self serve kiosks 
in  we opened a higher number of non standard restaurants in canada 
non standard restaurants include kiosks and locations in gas and convenience locations  hospitals  universities and office buildings and typically have lower initial franchise fees

total costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales was  million in fiscal  an increase of million  or compared to fiscal our cost of sales includes warehouse cost of sales  cost of sales from company operated restaurants  and cost of sales from restaurants required to be consolidated under fin r 
this increase was primarily driven by an increase in warehouse cost of sales of million  or  during the year 
of this increase  million was due to the increased cost of product and operating costs from frozen and some refrigerated product distribution and our dry goods distribution from the guelph facility  and million resulted from an increase in the number of restaurants opened and same store sales increases 
product mix and cost increases also contributed to increased cost of sales 
these increases were partially offset by foreign exchange impacts from the translation of expenses of our us operations from us dollars to canadian dollars see below 
distribution cost of sales represented of our total costs and expenses in fiscal as compared to of our total costs and expenses in fiscal as mentioned above  this shift in business mix is primarily attributable to the distribution of frozen and some refrigerated products from our guelph distribution facility 
now that our transition to three channel delivery is complete  warehouse sales as a percentage of revenues  for that portion related to frozen and refrigerated distribution  is expected to stabilize 
our distribution business will continue to be subject to changes related to the underlying costs of key commodities  such as coffee  sugar  etc 

table of contents these cost changes can impact warehouse revenues  costs and margins  and can create volatility quarter over quarter and year over year 
increases and decreases in commodity costs are largely passed through to franchisees  resulting in higher or lower revenues and higher or lower costs of sales from our distribution business 
these changes may impact margins as many of these products are typically priced based on a fixed dollar mark up 
company operated restaurant cost of sales  which includes food  paper  labour and occupancy costs  varies with the average number and mix eg  size  standard or non standard of company operated restaurants 
these costs decreased by million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of a decrease of  on average  in the number of company operated restaurants open during the year 
the consolidation of and restaurants  on average  under fin r during fiscal and  respectively  resulted in cost of sales of million and million  respectively

the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during fiscal over reduced the value of reported cost of sales by approximately 
operating expenses total operating expenses  representing primarily rent expense  depreciation and property costs  increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which was an increase of 
our canadian operations contributed the majority of the change with an increase of million in rent expense  depreciation and other property costs during the year 
rent expense increased million due to higher percentage rent costs on certain properties resulting from increased systemwide sales and an increase of properties being leased and then subleased to franchisees in canada in as at december   there were  properties leased by us in canada and then subleased to franchisees  compared to  such properties in fiscal operating expenses will increase in the future as the number of properties we lease from third parties for restaurant sites grows for existing and new leased properties where we pay percentage rent to third parties 
in addition  higher research and development costs in the area of new restaurant design and higher restaurant closure costs contributed to the year over year increase 
operating expenses from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support current operations and provide the infrastructure to support future growth 

table of contents this expense category also includes charges from wendy s for the periods in which we received services from them  in accordance with the shared services agreement 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in our objective is for general and administrative expense growth not to exceed revenue growth 
there can be quarterly fluctuations in general and administrative expenses due to timing or certain other events that may impact growth rates in any particular quarter 
general and administrative expenses increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal shared services costs from wendy s were lower in by million 
these lower costs were offset by higher salaries and benefits as we added resources to be a standalone public company  notwithstanding lower equity based compensation rsu costs in in addition to higher salaries and benefits  we incurred higher costs related to new information technology systems  insurance  legal costs  investor relations and shareholder costs  all of which were incurred as a result of us being a standalone public company 
in  we also incurred costs related to our franchisee convention and incurred higher costs related to us advertising and marketing 
costs related to stock based compensation were million lower than in the stock based compensation costs included the accelerated vesting of the wendy s restricted stock units to our executives and certain other employees as a result of our spin off from wendy s

equity income equity income relates to income from equity investments in joint ventures and other investments over which we exercise significant influence 
our two most significant equity investments are our joint venture with iaws group plc which provides our system with par baked donuts  timbits and some bread products  and our timwen partnership  which leases canadian tim hortons wendy s combination restaurants to both tim hortons and wendy s restaurants of canada inc in fiscal  equity income was million  an increase of million from fiscal  primarily as a result of discrete tax benefits at one of our joint ventures  operating gains at both of our key joint ventures and  a gain on the sale of excess land 
from time to time  our joint venture partners may sell properties that may result in gains or losses 
we do not expect tax benefits of a similar nature in other income and expense  net other income and expense  net  includes amounts that are not directly derived from our primary businesses

interest expense including affiliated interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase of million is primarily due to higher interest rates on our term debt which was outstanding for all of and higher interest on capital leases 

table of contents affiliated interest expense was million in  as a result of the us million note to wendy s that was repaid in march and april the us million note to wendy s had a per annum interest rate 
interest income interest income was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  resulting in a decrease of million  primarily due to lower average cash balances on hand in and the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar between fiscal and  which reduced interest income by approximately

income taxes our provision for income taxes includes provisions for us and canadian taxes 
prior to the period ended september   the date of the spin off  our us entities were included in the filing of a consolidated us tax return with wendy s and its other subsidiaries 
our us entities now file a separate consolidated us federal income tax return commencing for all periods ending after september  our and us income tax provision and related deferred income tax amounts were determined as if we filed tax returns on a standalone basis and were adjusted in accordance with the tax sharing agreement with wendy s 
the effective income tax rate in fiscal was  compared to in in  our effective tax rate was higher as a result of the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin and a related provision for uncertain tax positions of million recorded during the year 
in fiscal  our effective tax rate was lower as a result of the favourable resolution of tax audits and the benefit of lower taxes on non us earnings and related tax credits 
the determination of income tax expense takes into consideration amounts that may be needed to cover exposure for open tax years 
the canada revenue agency is currently conducting an examination of various canadian subsidiaries of the company for and subsequent taxation years 
the internal revenue service has concluded its examination of the wendy s consolidated tax group for the year which includes the company up to september  we do not currently expect any material impact on earnings to result from the resolution of matters related to open tax years  however  actual settlements may differ from amounts accrued 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized an increase of approximately million in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings 
additional amounts recognized in fiscal for tax positions related to the current and prior years  net of reductions for tax positions of prior years and settlements made for the year was approximately million

in addition  included in other comprehensive income was a loss related to cash flow hedges  net of taxes  of million in  compared to million of income  net of taxes  in liquidity and capital resources overview our primary source of liquidity has historically been  and continues to be  cash generated from canadian operations which has  for the most part  self funded our operations  growth in new restaurants  capital expenditures  dividends  share repurchases  acquisitions and investments during the last five years 
our us operations have historically been a net user of cash given investment plans and stage of growth  and we expect this trend to continue through our canadian and us revolving credit facilities provide additional sources of liquidity  if needed 
in fiscal  we generated million of cash from operations  as compared to cash generated from operations of million in fiscal  for a net decrease of million see comparative cash flows below 
we believe that we will continue to generate adequate operating cash flows to fund both our capital expenditures and expected debt service requirements over the next twelve months 
if additional funds are needed for strategic initiatives or other corporate purposes  we believe  given current market conditions  access would be limited or at a spread that may not be attractive  but that the strength of our balance sheet would allow us to borrow additional funds if we maintain our strong capital structure 
our ability to incur additional indebtedness will be limited by our financial and other covenants under our existing credit facilities and may take longer to fund in the current environment 
any such borrowings may result in an increase in our borrowing costs 
if such additional borrowings are significant  our capital structure could be weakened  and it is possible that we would not be able to borrow on terms which are favourable to us 
our senior bank facility  which consists of a million term loan and two revolving credit facilities us million and million  matures on february  these facilities are at variable interest rates that are based upon either bankers acceptances or libor plus a margin  or a fixed base rate 
if certain market conditions caused libor to be unascertainable or not reflective of the cost of funding  the administration agent can cause the borrowing to be at the base rate which is historically higher than libor 
this facility does not carry a market disruption clause and is supported by a syndicate lending group of financial institutions  of which canadian financial institutions hold approximately of the total funding commitment 
we carefully monitor our bank group and currently believe our access to liquidity is substantially unchanged despite current market conditions 
our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new store construction  renovations of existing restaurants  expansion of our business through vertical integration and general corporate needs 
in addition  we utilize cash to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs 
historically  our annual working capital needs have not been significant because of our focused management of accounts receivable and inventory 
in each of the last five fiscal years  operating cash flows have funded our capital expenditure requirements for new restaurant development  remodeling  technology initiatives and other capital needs 
in fiscal  we expect to open to restaurants in canada and to full serve restaurants in the us  complemented by non traditional locations  including self serve kiosks and strategic alliances 
our capital expenditures also includes approximately million relating to the construction of a new coffee roasting facility in hamilton  ontario 
when evaluating our leverage position  we look at metrics that consider the impact of long term operating and capital leases as well as other long term debt obligations 
we believe this provides a more meaningful measure of our leverage position given our significant investments in real estate 
at december   we had 
table of contents approximately million in term debt and capital leases included in long term obligations on our balance sheet 
we continue to believe that the strength of our balance sheet  including our cash position  provides us with opportunity and flexibility for future growth while still enabling us to return excess cash to our stockholders through a combination of our share repurchase program and dividends 
given the recent credit concerns in financial markets  currently  when investing our cash  we are more focused on capital preservation than yield 
in fiscal  we continued to repurchase shares under our previously announced stock repurchase program  which authorized the company to repurchase up to million of common stock 
in fiscal  we spent approximately million to repurchase approximately million shares under this program 
as at december   we had purchased an aggregate of approximately million shares for a total cost of million under the million repurchase program  which was concluded on october  in addition  million was spent to purchase shares from the tdl employee benefit trust trust see below 
the trust used the funds from this purchase to fulfill withholding obligations required by the settlement of rsu s from the trust 
since initiation of these share repurchase programs  we have repurchased an aggregate of approximately million shares  or of our outstanding common stock as of the date of inception of the first program  for a total cost of million 
separately  we spent million to acquire shares from the trust  as previously mentioned 
we have primarily funded all of these repurchases to date from our cash from operations 
as previously mentioned  our board of directors has approved a share repurchase program for up to million  or of our outstanding shares at the time of regulatory approval 
the program is planned to commence in march for twelve months ending in early march the program may terminate earlier if the million maximum or the of outstanding share limit is reached  or  at the discretion of management or our board of directors  subject to the company s compliance with regulatory requirements 
the company may make repurchases on the new york stock exchange and or the toronto stock exchange 
timing of the share repurchases will initially be solely at management s discretion given prevailing market conditions  cost and other considerations  unlike the previous programs which included a b program at inception 
we expect that all future purchases made under the program will be primarily funded from cash from operations 
if a subsequent decision is made to proceed with changes to the company s corporate structure  timing of share repurchases under this program could be affected  including potentially deferring future purchases subsequent to the first quarter until after a transaction is implemented 
in fiscal  we paid four quarterly dividends of per share  totaling approximately million 
in fiscal  we paid four quarterly dividends of per share  totaling million 
we have historically paid for all dividends primarily from cash generated from our operations  and we expect to continue to do so in our payout ratio range is to of prior year normalized net income  which is net income adjusted for certain discrete items  such as tax impacts and asset impairment and related closure costs  that affect our annual net income 
our payout ratio considers our free cash flow and has been benchmarked against companies in the north american quick serve restaurant sector and premier canadian retail companies 
in february  our board of directors approved an dividend increase from to per share of common stock 
this dividend increase brings the dividend to the high end of our payout ratio range 
notwithstanding our payout ratio range and the recent increase in our dividend  the declaration and payment of all future dividends remains subject to the discretion of our board of directors and the company s continued financial performance  debt covenant compliance and other risk factors 
in  we established the trust 
the trust holds shares of our common stock that will be used to satisfy our obligation to settle rsus granted to certain canadian employees under our stock incentive plan 
by establishing this trust  we are able to fix the amount of cash required to satisfy rsu obligations that vest in a future period at approximately the same dollar value at which the rsus were originally granted 
in fiscal and  the trust purchased million shares and million shares  respectively  of our common stock on the open market for a total cost of million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  the trust settled rsu obligations with the substantial majority of the company s canadian employees by disbursing million 
table of contents shares from the trust  with a total value of million  after provision for all applicable statutory withholding requirements 
in addition  as mentioned above  the company purchased  shares from the trust for a cost of million in to fulfill withholding and remittance obligations of the trust resulting from the aforementioned settlement from the trust 
these shares are now held as treasury shares 
in fiscal  rsu obligations to us employees and directors were settled with treasury shares  and certain other participants by open market purchase  all of the foregoing after provision for all applicable statutory withholding requirements 
since until our ipo on march   we were a wholly owned subsidiary of wendy s 
accordingly  we did not seek significant external financing as we received funding in various forms from wendy s 
wendy s primarily used a worldwide centralized approach to cash management and the financing of operations 
types of transactions between us and wendy s included i transfers of cash from our us operations to wendy s bank account on a regular basis  ii net cash borrowings from wendy s used to fund us operations  capital expenditures and acquisitions  and for other purposes  iii payment of related party dividends and interest to wendy s on a regular basis generated from our canadian operations  iv allocations of corporate expenses  and v cash borrowings from wendy s to finance purchase of former shareholder s shares

the senior bank facility  consisting of the term loan and two revolvers  matures on february  the term loan bears interest at bankers acceptances plus a margin 
the senior bank facility as amended on april   effective february  contains various covenants which  among other things  require the maintenance of two financial ratios a consolidated maximum total debt to earnings before interest expenses  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  the consolidated maximum debt coverage ratio is computed as consolidated total debt divided by net income before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and net of extraordinary non cash losses and gains incurred outside the ordinary course of business 
consolidated total debt the numerator primarily includes all liabilities for borrowed money  capital lease obligations  letters of credit whether or not related to borrowed money  the net marked to market under swap agreements and guarantee liabilities 
for the purposes of our covenant calculations  in accordance with the established terms of the senior credit facility  approximately million was added back to ebitda for the asset and other impairment costs  which excludes lease commitment and certain other cash costs 
even without this adjustment  we were in full compliance 

table of contents the minimum fixed charge coverage is computed as net income before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  rent expense  and net of extraordinary non cash losses and gains incurred outside the ordinary course of business  collectively as the numerator  divided by consolidated fixed charges 
consolidated fixed charges includes interest and rent expense 
for the purposes of our covenant calculations  in accordance with the established terms of the senior credit facility  approximately million was added back to ebitda for the asset and other impairment costs  which excludes lease commitment and certain other cash costs 
even without this adjustment  we were in full compliance 
in connection with the term loan facility  we entered into million of interest rate swaps in march and june with multiple financial institutions to help manage our exposure to interest rate volatility see item a interest rate risk

comparative cash flows operating activities 
net cash provided from operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in operating cash flows in fiscal decreased by million due primarily to a million increase in working capital requirements due primarily to the deferral of franchisee cash receipts due to the timing of the statutory holidays at year end  and lower income taxes payable due to reduced statutory rates in canada

sales also include sales from company operated restaurants and sales from approximately to restaurants on average  that are consolidated in accordance with fin r 
rents and royalties includes franchisee royalties and rental revenues 
franchise fees includes the sales revenue from initial equipment packages  as well as fees for various costs and expenses related to establishing a franchisee s business 
cost of sales includes costs associated with our distribution business  including cost of goods  direct labour  and depreciation  as well as the cost of goods delivered by third party distributors to the restaurants  and for canned coffee sold through grocery stores

operating expenses includes rent expense related to properties leased to franchisees and other property related costs including depreciation 

table of contents franchise fee costs includes costs of equipment sold to franchisees as part of the commencement of their restaurant business  as well as training and other costs necessary to ensure a successful restaurant opening 
general and administrative expenses includes costs that cannot be directly related to generating revenue  including expenses associated with our corporate and administrative functions  allocation of expenses related to corporate functions and services historically provided to us by wendy s and depreciation of office equipment  the majority of our information technology systems  and head office real estate 
equity income includes income from equity investments in joint ventures and other minority investments over which we exercise significant influence 
equity income from these investments is considered to be an integrated part of our business operations and is  therefore  included in operating income 
income amounts are shown as reductions to total costs and expenses 
asset impairment and related closure costs represents non cash charges relating to the impairment of long lived assets 
it also includes costs related to restaurant closures made as part of the southern new england restaurant closures in the fourth quarter of other income and expense includes expenses income that are not directly derived from our primary businesses 
expenses include foreign currency adjustments  gains and losses on asset sales  minority interest related to the consolidation of restaurants pursuant to fin r  and other asset write offs 
comprehensive income represents the change in our net assets during the reporting period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non owner sources 
it includes net income and other comprehensive income such as foreign currency translation adjustments and the net impact of cash flow hedges 
the application of critical accounting policies we describe our significant accounting policies  including our critical accounting policies  in note of our audited historical consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both significant and may require us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make assumptions and estimates that can have a material impact on the results of our operations 
these assumptions and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
estimates and judgments are inherent in  but not limited to the following the estimation of the collectibility of royalty and other franchise related revenue  legal obligations  income taxes  insurance liabilities  various other commitments and contingencies  valuations used when assessing potential impairment of and intangibles and other long lived assets  inventory valuation  gift certificate and cash card breakage  property and equipment  including the estimation of the useful lives of property and equipment and other long lived assets  and  valuations associated with estimating stock based compensation expense 
while management applies its judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time  actual results 
table of contents could vary from these assumptions or had different assumptions been used 
the company evaluates and updates its assumptions and estimates based on new events occurring  additional information being obtained or more experience being acquired 
in the normal course of business  we must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which also requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
we may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process 
however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates  and adjustments to income could be required 
basis of presentation in fiscal and  we received charges from wendy s  based on the terms of the shared services agreement 
these charges declined over and  reflective of our increasing independence from wendy s over this period 
in fiscal  the services we received from wendy s were limited to information technology services only 
we terminated these services from wendy s in december  after we transitioned to our own general ledger and us fixed asset repository system 
affiliated interest expense  net  in the consolidated statements of operations reflected interest costs related to specific net borrowings by us  in the form of promissory notes  from wendy s 
no amount is included in affiliated interest expense  net for other amounts owed to wendy s by us which were not in the form of a promissory note and for which no interest rate was specified 
we entered into new credit facilities which are guaranteed by us and certain of our other subsidiaries see liquidity and capital resources credit facilities above 
prior to our spin off from wendy s the functional currency of tim hortons inc was historically the us dollar primarily because of its financial inter relatedness with wendy s 
tim hortons inc is essentially a holding company that holds investments and obligations that historically could have been carried on the books of wendy s and the functional currency of wendy s was the us dollar 
the completion of the ipo and the repayment of the note payable to wendy s in resulted in a change in the functional currency of tim hortons inc from the us dollar to the canadian dollar as the majority of the company s cash flows were  and continue to be in canadian dollars  in accordance with statement of accounting standards sfas no 
foreign currency translation 
the functional currency of each of the company s subsidiaries and legal entities is the local currency in which each subsidiary operates  which is the canadian dollar  the us dollar or euro 
the majority of the company s operations  restaurants and cash flows are based in canada  and the company is primarily managed in canadian dollars 
as a result  the reporting currency is the canadian dollar 
other than the adoption of sfas  as noted below  there have been no significant changes in critical accounting policies or management estimates since the year ended december  effective december   we adopted sfas no 
fair value measurements sfas 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we have adopted the provisions of sfas with respect to our financial assets and liabilities only 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
effective december   we also adopted sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for specified financial assets and liabilities on a contract by contract basis with changes in value reported in earnings 
we did not elect to report any assets or liabilities at fair value under this standard 

table of contents described below are critical accounting policies  which should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for a full understanding of our financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue at company operated restaurants is recognized upon tender of payment at the time of sale 
we operate warehouses in canada to distribute coffee and other dry goods and refrigerated and frozen products to an extensive franchise system 
revenues from these sales are recorded when the product is delivered to the franchisee  or in certain cases  where the product is delivered to a third party distributor 
royalty revenues are generally based upon a percentage of monthly sales and are recognized in the month earned 
royalties are normally collected within the month or shortly thereafter 
we generally control  either through ownership or by leasing  a significant majority of the real estate on which the company s restaurants are located  and we lease the real estate to our franchisees 
rental income  excluding contingent rent  is recorded on the straight line basis 
most leases provide for fixed payments with contingent rent when sales exceed certain levels  while others provide for monthly rentals based on a percentage of sales 
fixed  or base  rental revenue is recorded on a straight line basis and contingent rental revenue is recognized when sales exceed certain levels 
franchise operations our restaurants are predominantly franchised 
we grant franchise licenses or operator agreements to independent operators who in turn pay franchise fees and other payments  which may include payments for equipment  royalties and  in most cases  rents for each restaurant opened 
franchise fees are collected at the time of sale or resale of the franchise 
franchise fees and equipment sales are generally recognized as income when each restaurant commences operations and payment is received from the franchisee  unless the franchisee is participating in our franchise incentive program see below 
royalties  based on a percent of monthly sales  are recognized as income on the accrual basis 
we have developed a franchise incentive program for some of our us franchisees  which provides financing for both the initial franchise fee and the purchase of certain restaurant equipment  furniture  trade fixtures  and interior signs 
the payment for those assets is deferred for a period of weeks from the date of opening 
the initial franchise fee revenue is recognized at the time of sale  with consideration for potential uncollectibility  and the equipment revenue is recognized after a sustained period of sales levels are achieved  or weeks  whichever is earlier 
in  the franchise incentive program was modified by shortening the payment period from weeks to weeks 
in addition  the franchisee has the option to pay for the initial franchise fee  including interest thereon  over a period of up to weeks from the opening of the restaurant 
during the initial weeks  the royalty payments are typically reduced from to and rent is typically reduced from to of gross sales  respectively 
after the initial weeks  the royalty rate and rental rate return to the standard rates of and  respectively 
franchisees may receive other financial assistance such as lower rents and royalties and certain other operating costs for restaurants in new and developing markets  and the amount of this assistance is an offset from our rents and royalties revenues 
the timing of revenue recognition for sales  and franchise revenues rents and royalties and franchise fees  does not involve significant estimates and assumptions  other than determining when the levels of sustained period of sales thresholds have been met 
we provide for estimated losses for revenues that are not likely to be collected 
although we generally enjoy a positive relationship with our franchisees  and collection rates have historically been high  if average sales or the financial health of our franchisees were to deteriorate  we might have to increase reserves against collection of franchise revenues 
in some cases in the us  we have seen a slight increase in the number of days taken to collect receivables from franchisees  and we are monitoring the outstanding accounts receivables 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
we record both canadian and us income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is determined for each temporary difference based on the currently enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are expected to be realized  except for the amount of earnings related to our foreign operations where repatriation is not contemplated in the foreseeable future 
when considered necessary  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
management must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine the proper valuation allowance 
when we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflect the change in the period such determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to this valuation allowance 
we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
as a subsidiary of wendy s  we were not a separate taxable entity for us federal and certain state income tax purposes prior to september  consequently  wendy s included our results of operations in its combined us federal and state income tax returns for the period until our separation from wendy s on september  for periods prior to september   our us tax provision was computed on a separate return basis 
effective january   we adopted fin  which provides guidance for the recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in accordance with fin  we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of million  increasing our liability for unrecognized tax benefits  interest  and penalties and reducing the january  balance of retained earnings 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for more information on income taxes 
property and equipment depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight line method in amounts adequate to amortize costs over the following estimated useful lives depreciation periods buildings and leasehold improvements to years or lease term restaurant and other equipment to years capital leases to years or lease term computer hardware and software to years advertising fund property and equipment to years other to years construction in progress reclassified to above categories when put in use we estimate useful lives on buildings and equipment based on historical data and industry trends 
we monitor our capitalization and amortization policies to ensure they remain appropriate 
lives may be related to legal or contractual lives or must be estimated by management based on specific circumstances 
lease term as defined in sfas no 
accounting for leases  as amended 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are grouped into operating markets  which represent the lowest level of independent cash flows for our business  and tested for impairment whenever an event or circumstance occurs that indicates impairment may exist  including a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of prior to its estimated useful life 
events such as prolonged negative same store sales 
table of contents growth in the market  which is a key operating metric  or prolonged negative cash flows in the operating market  are indicators that we use in evaluating whether an impairment may exist 
we may also test for impairment if we have a higher than normal amount of restaurant closures in any one market 
in developed markets  one of our key indicators for the overall health of an operating market is same store sales growth 
we also consider the length of time we have been in the market as it takes time to fully establish a market 
generally  if same store sales decline for two or more consecutive years  further evaluation may be required  including review of operating market cash flows 
in developing markets  we assess a number of factors  including systemwide sales growth  which encompasses new restaurants and same store sales growth  the stage of growth of the operating market and the average unit sales volume trends  as well as a higher than normal amount of restaurant closures in a market 
given the market conditions present for the majority of the period under review  we also make assessments as to whether any declines are an indication of expected long term performance for the developing market 
once it is determined that a triggering event has occurred  an undiscounted cash flow analysis is completed on the affected market to determine if the future expected cash flows of a market are sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets 
if it is determined that the undiscounted cash flows are insufficient  then the market is deemed to be impaired 
the fair value of the property and equipment is estimated using primarily third party appraisals 
the estimated fair value is allocated to individual assets within the group 
gift certificates and cash cards in  we introduced a quick pay cash card program the timcard 
customers can prepay for future purchases at participating tim hortons restaurants or over the internet by loading funds onto the timcard by cash or credit card when and as needed 
the timcards entitle the holder to use the value for purchasing product only and the amounts generally are nonrefundable and not redeemable for cash 
holders of the timcards are not entitled to any interest  dividends or returns on prepaid amounts 
there are no expiration dates on the cash cards  and we do not charge any service fees that cause a decrease to customer balances 
cash collected from the loading of the timcard and interest earned thereon is recorded as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet since these funds have been designated for use only by the cash card program to honour outstanding obligations 
changes in the restricted cash and cash equivalents balances have been classified as an operating activity on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the restricted cash and cash equivalents balances at december  and december   represent the prepaid amounts not yet redeemed by customers 
since the inception of the program  interest on the restricted cash and cash equivalents has been contributed to our advertising and promotion funds to help offset costs associated with this program 
while we will honour all cash cards presented for payment  we may  based on historical review after the program has been in place for some time  determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to  among other things  long periods of inactivity 
in these circumstances  to the extent management determines there is no requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws  the obligation for any such card balances may be transferred to our advertising and promotion funds 
no amounts were recognized in or in addition to the timcard program  we continue to have gift certificates available in certain locations for a limited time 
the company will honour outstanding gift certificates 
when a customer uses a gift certificate or a timcard to purchase product at a company operated restaurant  we recognize the revenue from the sale of the product 
when a customer uses a gift certificate or timcard at a franchised restaurant  we recognize revenues  in the form of rents and royalties  arising from the sale of the goods and services 
we recognize income on unredeemed gift certificates gift certificate breakage when it can determine that the likelihood of the gift certificate being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift certificate value to relevant jurisdictions 
we determine gift certificate breakage based on historical redemption patterns 
once the breakage rate is determined it is recognized over a seven year time period which is the estimated life of a gift certificate 
insignificant amounts have been recognized as a reduction in cost of sales in fiscal  and 
table of contents reserve contingencies for litigation and other matters in the normal course of business  we must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process  however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates  and adjustments to income could be required 
variable interest entities we enter into flexible lease arrangements with certain operators that are not required to invest a significant amount of equity 
because the legal entity within which such an operator operates is considered to not be adequately capitalized  that entity is considered a variable interest entity vie as defined by fin r 
based on our review of the financial statements received from these operators  our mathematical projections indicate we are the primary beneficiary of these vies and  accordingly  we have consolidated  and restaurants  or approximately  and of our total franchise restaurants  at year end   and  respectively 
the related minority interest is not considered material and is classified in other expense income  net on the consolidated statement of operations and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
in fiscal  we will be adopting sfas no 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 which requires us to change certain of our classifications relating to minority interests 
we have no equity interest in any of our franchisees and have no off balance sheet exposures relative to any of our franchisees 
none of our assets serves as collateral for the consolidated restaurants  and creditors of these operators have no recourse to us 
the only exposure to us related to these vies relates to the collection of amounts due to us  which are collected weekly 
the agreements governing the lease arrangements can be cancelled by either the franchisee or us with days notice  further reducing potential exposure 
vies for which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary have an inconsequential impact on our reported consolidated net income 
the impact of consolidating these vies to our consolidated balance sheets is also not significant 
there is a small percentage of restaurants considered to be vies in which we hold a significant variable interest  but for which we are not the primary beneficiary 
our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this small percentage of franchise restaurants is also not material 
in connection with rsu awards to employees  the company established the trust that purchased and will retain shares to satisfy our contractual obligation to deliver stock to settle the awards for most canadian employees 
for accounting purposes  the cost of the shares held in the trust has been accounted for as a reduction in outstanding shares of common stock and the trust has been consolidated in accordance with fin r since the company is the primary beneficiary 
stock based compensation we currently provide compensation to certain employees in the form of restricted stock units and stock options with tandem stock appreciation rights  and to directors in the form of deferred stock units 
we previously issued restricted stock units to directors  but these were completely vested and settled in november we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r share based payment 
our stock incentive plan is an omnibus plan  designed to allow for a broad range of equity based compensation awards in the form of restricted stock units  stock options  stock appreciation rights  dividend equivalent rights  performance awards and share awards 
in addition  we may issue deferred stock units to our directors under our non employee director deferred share unit plan 
restricted stock units restricted stock units granted are measured at the fair value on grant day 
restricted stock units are generally expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the expense is recorded in general and administrative expenses  consistent with the classification of the related employees compensation expense 
grants related to retirement eligible employees are expensed immediately 
restricted stock units have 
table of contents dividend equivalent rights 
in addition  we may grant performance based restricted stock units to certain of our employees 
the performance component is based on historical measures and is only used to determine the amount of units granted 
all other characteristics of the performance based restricted stock units are the same as restricted stock units 
deferred stock units deferred stock units are granted to non employee members of the our board of directors and are expensed on the date of grant since they vest immediately 
deferred stock units are notional units which track the value of our common stock 
these units are settled in cash based on the value of our common stock on the toronto stock exchange on the date of the director s separation of service from the company 
since the award is settled in cash  the award is accounted for using the liability method  which results in a revaluation of the liability to fair value each period and expensed 
deferred stock units have dividend equivalent rights  which are expensed as earned 
stock options the company uses the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions  including estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them the expected term  the expected volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations 
we issued stock option awards with tandem stock appreciation rights see below in for the first time to our named executive officers 
we did not issue any stock option awards in fiscal and stock appreciation rights stock appreciation rights sars may be granted alone or in conjunction with a stock option 
a sar related to an option generally terminates upon the expiration  forfeiture  or exercise of the related option  and is exercisable only to the extent that the related option is exercisable 
stock options with tandem sars enable the employee to exercise the stock option or receive a cash payment equal to the difference between the market price of the share on the exercise date and the exercise price of the stock option 
since the employee can request settlement in cash  the award is accounted for using the liability method  which results in a revaluation of the liability to fair value each period and expensed over the vesting period 
we issued sars in tandem with stock options in for the first time to our named executive officers 
we did not issue any sars in fiscal and segmented reporting we operate exclusively in the food service industry and have determined that our reportable segments are those that are based on methods of internal reporting and management structure and represent the manner in which our chief decision maker views and evaluates the various aspects of our business 
our reportable segments are the geographic locations of canada and the us recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks associated with foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  interest rates and inflation 
in accordance with our policies  we manage our exposure to various market based risks 
foreign exchange risk our exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily related to fluctuations between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
our primary foreign exchange exposure to our cash flows results from purchases by canadian operations in us dollars and payments from canadian operations to us operations 
net cash flows between the canadian and us dollar currencies were in excess of million for fiscal in addition  we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations when we translate our us operating results into canadian dollars for reporting purposes 
while these fluctuations are not significant to the consolidated operating results  the fluctuations in exchange rates do impact our us segment operating results  and can affect the comparability between quarters and year to year 
also  from time to time  we hold us dollars and other us dollar net 
table of contents positions in canadian dollar functional currency entities to support our business needs and as a result of our cross border structure 
the holding of us dollar net positions in these entities can cause foreign exchange gains and losses which are included in other expense income  net  and can  therefore  affect our earnings 
we seek to manage significant cash flows and net income exposures related to exchange rate changes between these two currencies 
we may use derivative products to reduce the risk of a significant impact on our cash flows or net income 
forward currency contracts are entered into to reduce some of the risk related to purchases paid for by the canadian operations in us dollars  such as coffee  including certain intercompany purchases 
in addition  historically  we hedged wendy s investment in its canadian subsidiaries 
we do not hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on net income and cash flows 
we have a policy forbidding speculating in foreign currency 
by their nature  derivative financial instruments involve risk including the credit risk of non performance by counterparties  and our maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized in our balance sheet 
to minimize this risk  except in certain circumstances  we limit the notional amount per counterparty to a maximum of million 
we have reviewed counter party risk related to these derivative positions and do not believe there is significant risk with respect to these instruments 
forward currency contracts to sell canadian dollars and buy us million and us million were outstanding as of december  and december   respectively  primarily to hedge coffee purchases from third parties  including intercompany purchases 
the fair value unrealized gain on these forward contracts was million as of december  compared to an unrealized loss of million as of december  in  we entered into forward currency contracts that matured in march to sell million and buy us million to hedge the repayment of cross border intercompany notes being marked to market beginning in the third quarter of previously  the translation of these intercompany notes was recorded in comprehensive income  rather than in the consolidated statements of operations  in accordance with sfas no 
foreign currency translation 
the fair value unrealized loss on these contracts as of january  was million  net of taxes of million 
on the maturity date of march   we received us million from the counterparties and disbursed to the counterparties million  resulting in a net cash flow of us million million to the counterparties representing the difference from the contract rate to spot rate on settlement 
these forward currency contracts remained highly effective cash flow hedges and qualified for hedge accounting treatment through their maturity 
as a result  changes in the fair value of the effective portion of these foreign currency contracts offset changes in the cross border intercompany notes  and a million gain was recognized as the ineffective portion of the foreign currency contracts in in  we entered into forward currency contracts to sell million canadian dollars and buy us million in order to hedge certain net investment positions in canadian subsidiaries 
under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities these forward currency contracts were designated as highly effective hedges 
the fair value unrealized loss on these contracts was million  net of taxes of million as of january  on the maturity dates in april   we received us million from the counterparties and disbursed to the counterparties million  resulting in a net cash flow of us million million to the counterparties representing the difference from the contract rate to spot rate on settlement 
these forward currency contracts remained highly effective cash flow hedges and qualified for hedge accounting treatment through their maturity 
the cumulative fair value realized loss on these contracts was million  net of taxes of million  on maturity in april changes in the fair value of these foreign currency net investment hedges are included in the translation adjustments line of other comprehensive income loss 
no amounts related to these net investment hedges impacted earnings 
at the current level of annual operating income generated from our us operations and current us dollar cash flow exposures  if the us currency rate changes by the entire year  the annual impact on our net income and annual cash flows would not be material 

table of contents commodity risk we purchase certain products such as coffee  wheat  edible oil and sugar in the normal course of business  the prices of which are affected by commodity prices 
therefore  we are exposed to some price volatility related to weather and more importantly  various other market conditions outside of our control 
however  we do employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility 
generally these techniques include setting fixed prices for periods of up to one year with suppliers  setting in advance the price for products to be delivered in the future and unit pricing based on an average of commodity prices over the corresponding period of time 
we purchase a significant amount of green coffee and typically have purchase commitments fixing the price for a minimum of six months  and typically hedge against the risk of foreign exchange at the same time 
we do not generally make use of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  partly because of these contract pricing techniques 
as we make purchases beyond our current commitments  we may be subject to higher commodity prices depending upon prevailing market conditions 
while price volatility can occur  which would impact profit margins  we and our franchisees have some ability to increase product pricing to offset a rise in commodity prices  subject to franchisee and customer acceptance 
in addition  we currently have purchase contracts in place for at least the first half of covering key commodities such as coffee  wheat  sugar  and cooking oils 
as we have stated previously  we may be subject to higher commodity prices depending upon prevailing market conditions and foreign exchange rates at the time we make purchases beyond our current commitments 
higher commodity costs could also impact earnings from our joint venture operations  and we have indicated our intention not to pass on such higher costs to our franchisees in interest rate risk prior to february  we had insignificant external borrowings 
we are exposed to interest rate risk because our term debt of million bears a floating rate of interest  which is partially offset by cash that is primarily invested in floating rate instruments 
we seek to manage our net exposure to interest rate risk and our net borrowing costs by managing the mix of fixed and floating rate instruments based on capital markets and business conditions 
we will not enter into speculative swaps or other speculative financial contracts 
in february  we entered into an interest rate swap for million of our million term loan facility to convert a portion of the variable rate debt from floating rate to fixed rate 
in the second quarter of  we entered into an additional million interest rate swap  resulting in a total of million in interest rate swaps outstanding in connection with our term loan 
the swaps convert a portion of the variable rate debt from floating rate to fixed rate 
the interest rate swaps essentially fix the interest rate on million of the million term loan at and mature on february  the weighted average interest rate on the term debt  including the swapped portion  was for fiscal 
the interest rate swaps are considered to be highly effective cash flow hedges according to criteria specified in sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the fair value unrealized loss on these contracts as of december  was million  net of taxes of million 
if interest rates change by basis points  the impact on our annual net income which would be reduced due to our variable rate investments  would not be material 
we have reviewed counter party risk related to these derivative positions and do not believe there is significant risk with respect to these instruments 
inflation consolidated financial statements determined on an historical cost basis may not accurately reflect all the effects of changing prices on an enterprise 
several factors tend to reduce the impact of inflation for our business inventories approximate current market prices  property holdings at fixed costs are substantial  and there is some ability to adjust prices
