overview acme packet  inc is the leading provider of session border controllers  or sbcs  that enable service providers and enterprises to deliver secure and high quality interactive communications voice  video and other real time multimedia sessions across defined border points where internet protocol  or ip networks connect  known as network borders 
as of december   more than end users in countries have deployed our products 
we sell our products and support services through our 
table of contents direct sales force and approximately distribution partners  including many of the largest networking and telecommunications equipment vendors throughout the world 
our headquarters are located in burlington  massachusetts 
we maintain sales offices in burlington  massachusetts  madrid  spain  seoul  korea  tokyo  japan  and ipswich  united kingdom 
we also have sales personnel in argentina  australia  belgium  brazil  canada  china  croatia  france  germany  hong kong  india  italy  malaysia  mexico  the netherlands  new zealand  peru  russia  south africa  taiwan  and thailand and throughout the united states 
in the short term we expect to selectively add personnel in the united states and internationally to provide additional geographic sales and technical support coverage 
initial public offering in october  we completed an initial public offering  or ipo  of our common stock in which we sold and issued million shares of our common stock  including million shares sold by us pursuant to the underwriters full exercise of their over allotment option  at an issue price of per share 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds from the ipo  or million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of million 
upon the closing of the ipo  all shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into million shares of common stock 
industry background service providers traditionally have delivered voice and data services over two separate networks the public switched telephone network  or pstn  and the internet 
the pstn provides high reliability and security but is costly to operate and is limited in its ability to support high bandwidth video and other interactive multimedia services 
the internet is capable of cost effectively transmitting any form of traffic that is ip based  including interactive voice  video and data  but it transmits only on a best efforts basis  because all forms of traffic have the same priority 
therefore  the internet attempts to deliver all traffic without distinction  which can result in significantly varying degrees of service quality for the same or similar types of traffic transmissions 
internet based services are also subject to disruptive and fraudulent behavior  including identity theft  viruses  unwanted and excessively large input data  known as spam  and the unauthorized use and attempts to circumvent or bypass security mechanisms associated with those services  known as hacking 
service providers are beginning to migrate to a single ip network architecture to serve as the foundation for their next generation voice  video and data service offerings 
in order to provide secure and high quality interactive communications on a converged ip network  service providers must be able to manage and integrate the communications flows that comprise communication sessions for applications such as interactive video and voice over ip  or voip  which allows the routing of voice conversations over the internet 
prior to the advent of the sbc  ip network infrastructure equipment  such as softswitches  routers and data firewalls  was able to initiate and route undifferentiated data but lacked the ability to target specifically the management of interactive communication sessions 
we believe that there is significant demand for sbcs that can facilitate the delivery of secure and high quality real time interactive communications across all ip network borders 
infonetics research  a market research and consulting firm specializing in networking and ip communications  projects that worldwide revenue for sbcs will increase from million in to million in we see rapidly emerging opportunities for our solutions within large enterprises  contact centers  and wireless service providers 
we believe that enterprise ip telephony ipt is now mainstream  and that unified communications uc or the integration of interactive voice  video  messaging and collaboration applications over ip will soon follow 
both are critical components of enterprise it 
table of contents strategies to improve business agility  increase employee efficiency and responsiveness  build customer satisfaction and loyalty  and reduce overhead costs 
we believe that these components are indispensable tools for success in a newly competitive global marketplace 
the full scale deployment of enterprise ipt has revealed deficiencies in network and security infrastructure originally deployed for data 
consequently  we believe that enterprises will likely be adding further controls to their ipt uc infrastructure to improve its security  extend its application reach  meet service level commitments  optimize capital and operating costs  and comply with relevant commercial and government regulations 
enterprises are deploying sbcs to successfully deliver network security  availability  and performance as well as to achieve control over the four key borders within their ipt uc infrastructure ip trunking  private network  internet  and hosted services interconnect borders 
we believe that the majority of large enterprises today having already deployed ip pbxs are about to rapidly embrace sip trunking to reduce costs and set the foundation for enabling end to end ip uc 
within today s modern contact center  the migration of voice services from tdm to ip is now well underway 
this migration is essential to the contact center s strategic goals meeting customers growing service expectations  achieving ever higher performance and quality metrics  improving agent retention rates  growing revenues and reducing capital and operating costs 
however  existing network and security infrastructure that was originally deployed for tdm voice services and data applications have demonstrated deficiencies for ip interactive communications 
we believe that contact center strategists are deploying sbcs to assert control over the four critical ip network borders found in most contact centers its connections to ip trunking service providers  to managed private ip networks  to the public internet  and to virtual contact center locations 
with sbcs to reinforce these borders in five key functional areas security  application reach  sla assurance  cost optimization  and regulatory compliance contact centers can successfully and safely navigate the transition to an ip infrastructure 
our early customers within this market have included the contact center operations of our tier service providers throughout north america  europe  as well as central and latin america 
key financial measures some of our key financial measures for include net revenues were million for compared to million in  net income for was million compared to million in  net income per share was on a diluted basis for compared to per share on a diluted basis in  and cash flow from operating activities was million for compared to million in the acme packet strategy principal elements of our strategy include continuing to satisfy the evolving border requirements of large service providers  enterprises and contact centers 
our sbc deployments in the wireline  wireless and cable networks of tier and other large service providers  as well as in enterprises and contact centers  position us to gain valuable knowledge that we can use to expand and enhance our products features and functionality 
exploiting new technologies to enhance product performance and scalability 
we will seek to leverage new technologies as they become available to increase the performance  capacity and functionality of our product family  as well as to reduce our costs 

table of contents investing in quality and responsive support 
as we broaden our product platform and increase our product capabilities  we will continue to provide comprehensive service and support targeted at maximizing customer satisfaction and retention 
facilitating and promoting service interconnects among our customers 
we intend to increase demand for our products by helping our customers to extend the reach of their services and  consequently  to increase the value of their services to their customers 
leveraging distribution partnerships to enhance market penetration 
we will continue to invest in training and tools for our distribution partners sales  systems engineering and support organizations  in order to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of these partnerships 
actively contributing to architecture and standards definition processes 
we will utilize our breadth and depth of experience with sbc deployments to contribute significantly to organizations developing standards and architectures for next generation ip networks 
factors that may affect future performance global macroeconomic conditions 
we believe that the capital budgets of some of our core customers service providers and enterprises and contact centers may be affected by the current worldwide economic downturn  including uncertainly in the global financial markets 
for example  during we had a significant increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts primarily related to the bankruptcy proceedings of one of our distribution partners 
our ability to generate revenue from these core customers is dependent on the status of such capital budgets 
should the current uncertainty in these areas continue  our revenues could be adversely impacted 
gross margin 
our gross margin has been  and will continue to be  affected by many factors  including a the demand for our products and services  b the average selling price of our products  which in turn depends in part on the mix of product configurations sold  c the level of software license upgrades  d new product introductions  e the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold  and f the volume and costs of manufacturing our hardware products and related support services 
customers license our software in various configurations depending on the customers requirements for session capacity  feature groups and protocols 
the product software configuration mix will have a direct impact on the average selling price of the system sold 
systems with higher software content higher session capacity and a larger number of feature groups will generally have a higher average selling price than those systems sold with lower software content 
if customers begin to purchase systems with lower software content  this will have a negative impact on our gross margins 
competition 
the market for sbcs is competitive and constantly evolving 
while we believe we are currently the market leader  we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future as the sbc market grows 
our primary competitors generally consist of start up vendors  such as genband  and more established network and component companies such as cisco systems 
we also compete with some of the companies with which we have distribution partnerships  such as sonus networks and ericsson 
we believe we compete successfully with all of these companies based upon our experience in interactive communications networks  the breadth of our applications and standards support  the depth of our border control features  the demonstrated ability of our products to interoperate with key communications infrastructure elements  and our comprehensive service and support 
we also believe our products are priced competitively with other market offerings 
as the sbc market opportunity grows  we expect competition from additional networking and ip communications equipment suppliers  including other distribution partners 

table of contents our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
our competitors may have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we do  including relationships with our potential customers 
in addition  these companies may have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to market and sell their products more effectively 
moreover  if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors  the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
we expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we expand our sales force to attempt to increase our revenue and market share 
evolution of the sbc market 
the market for sbcs is in its early stages and is still evolving  and it is uncertain whether these products will continue to achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance 
our success will depend  to a substantial extent  on the willingness of interactive communications service providers to continue to implement sbcs 
research and development 
to continue to achieve market acceptance for our products  we must effectively anticipate and adapt  in a timely  manner to customer requirements and must offer products that meet changing customer demands 
prospective customers may require product features and capabilities that our current products do not have 
the market for sbcs is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  and evolving industry requirements 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts  which we believe are essential to maintaining our competitive position 
managing growth 
we significantly expanded our operations in and during the period from december  through december  we increased the number of our employees and full time independent contractors by  from to  and we opened new sales offices in spain  korea and the united kingdom 
we anticipate that further expansion of our infrastructure and headcount will be required to achieve planned expansion of our product offerings  projected increases in our customer base and anticipated growth in the number of product deployments 
in the future  we expect to continue to carefully manage the increase of our operating expenses based on our ability to expand our revenues 
revenue we derive product revenue from the sale of our net net hardware and the licensing of our net net software 
we generally recognize product revenue at the time of product delivery  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  pursuant to the requirements of statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
for arrangements that include customer acceptance or other material non standard terms  we defer revenue recognition until after delivery  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we generate maintenance  support and service revenue from a maintenance associated with software licenses  b technical support services for our product software  c hardware repair and maintenance services  d implementation  training and consulting services and e reimbursable travel and other out of pocket expenses paid to us by our customers 
we offer our products and services indirectly through distribution partners and directly through our sales force 
our distribution partners include networking and telecommunications equipment vendors throughout the world 
our distribution partners generally purchase our products after they have received a purchase order from their customers and do not maintain an inventory of our products 
table of contents in anticipation of sales to their customers 
generally  the pricing offered to our distribution partners will be lower than to our direct customers 
the product configuration  which reflects the mix of session capacity and requested features  determines the price for each sbc sold 
customers can purchase our sbcs in either a standalone or high availability configuration and can license our software in various configurations  depending on the customers requirements for session capacity  feature groups and protocols 
the product software configuration mix will have a direct impact on the average selling price of the system sold 
as the market continues to develop and grow  we expect to experience increased price pressure on our products and services 
we believe that our revenue and results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of long sales and deployment cycles  variations in customer ordering patterns  and the application of complex revenue recognition rules to certain transactions 
some of our arrangements with customers include clauses under which we may be subject to penalties for failure to meet specified performance obligations 
we have not incurred any such penalties to date 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue primarily consists of a payments to third party manufacturers for purchased materials and services  b salaries and wages and related benefits  c related overhead and d provision for inventory obsolescence 
cost of maintenance  support and service revenue consists primarily of a salaries and wages and related benefits to professional services and technical support personnel  b related overhead  c billable and non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket expenses  and d contract services for repairs and warranty services 
gross profit our gross profit has been  and will be  affected by many factors  including a the demand for our products and services  b the mix between product and service revenue  c the average selling price of our products  which in turn depends  in part  on the mix of product configurations sold  d new product introductions  e the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold  f the volume and costs of manufacturing of our hardware products and g the costs of personnel for manufacturing support and services 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
during the period from december  through december   we increased the number of our employees and full time independent contractors by  from to we expect to selectively hire new employees in the short term to support our expected growth 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  b commissions  c travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses  d marketing programs such as trade shows and e other related overhead 
commissions are recorded as expense when earned by the employee 
we expect sales and marketing expense to modestly increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for the foreseeable future as we expand our sales force to continue to increase our revenue and market share 
however  we anticipate that sales and marketing expense will decrease as a percentage of total revenue in the long term 
research and development expense consists primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  b payments to suppliers for design and consulting services  c prototype and equipment costs relating 
table of contents to the design and development of new products and enhancement of existing products  d quality assurance and testing and e other related overhead 
to date  all of the costs related to our research and development efforts have been expensed as incurred 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts  which we believe are essential to maintaining our competitive position 
we expect research and development expense to modestly increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for the foreseeable future 
however  we anticipate that research and development expense will decrease as a percentage of total revenue in the long term 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of a salaries and wages and personnel costs related to our executive  finance  human resource and information technology organizations  b facilities expenses  c accounting and legal professional fees and d other related overhead 
we expect general and administrative expense to modestly increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we invest in infrastructure to support continued growth and incur ongoing expenses related to being a publicly traded company  including increased audit and legal fees  costs of compliance with securities and other regulations  investor relations expense  and higher insurance premiums 
stock based compensation cost of revenue and operating expenses include stock based compensation expense 
effective january   we adopted the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r addresses all forms of shared based payment awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas no 
r requires us to expense share based payment awards with compensation cost for share based payment transactions measured at fair value 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded expense of million  million and  respectively  in connection with share based payment awards 
based on share based awards granted in  and  a future expense of non vested options of million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
other income expense  net other income expense primarily consists of interest income earned on cash balances 
we historically have invested our cash in money market funds 
other income expense also includes gains losses from foreign currency translation adjustments of our foreign subsidiaries 
the functional currency of our foreign operations in europe and asia is the us dollar 
accordingly  all assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are re measured into us dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses of these foreign subsidiaries are re measured into us dollars at the average rates in effect during the year 
any differences resulting from the re measurement of assets  liabilities and operations of the european and asian subsidiaries are recorded within other income expense 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented in this annual report on form k 

table of contents we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  as amended by sop  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position to nonsoftware deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
we have determined that the software element of our product is more than incidental to the products as a whole 
as a result  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 we are required to recognize revenue under the guidance of sop and sop in all of our arrangements  we do not recognize any revenue until we can determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and we deem collection of the related accounts receivable to be probable 
in making these judgments  we evaluate these criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by the customer and us to be representative of persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we consider delivery to have occurred when product has been delivered to the customer and no significant post delivery obligations exist 
in instances where customer acceptance is required  delivery is deemed to have occurred when customer acceptance has been achieved 
certain of our agreements contain products that might not conform to published specifications or contain a requirement to deliver additional elements which are essential to the functionality of the delivered element 
revenue associated with these agreements is recognized when the customer specifications have been met or delivery of the additional elements has occurred 
fees are fixed or determinable 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within normal payment terms 
if the fee is subject to refund or adjustment  we recognize revenue when the right to a refund or adjustment lapses 
if offered payment terms exceed our normal terms  we recognize revenue as the amounts become due and payable or upon the receipt of cash 
collection of the related accounts receivable is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all transactions at the inception of an arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if  based upon our evaluation  we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  revenue is deferred and recognized upon the receipt of cash 
a substantial percentage of our revenue is generated by multiple element arrangements  such as products  maintenance  professional services and training 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we allocate the total fee among the various elements using the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized when vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements of the arrangement  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of the arrangement 
each arrangement requires us to analyze the individual elements in the transaction and to estimate the fair value of each undelivered element  which typically includes maintenance and services 
revenue is allocated to each of the undelivered elements based on 
table of contents its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
maintenance and support services include telephone support  return and repair services  and unspecified rights to product upgrades and enhancements  and are recognized ratably over the term of the service period  which is generally months 
maintenance and support revenue generally is deferred until the related product has been accepted and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
professional services and training revenue is recognized as the related service is performed 
our products and services are distributed indirectly through distribution partners and directly through our sales force 
revenue arrangements with distribution partners are recognized when the above criteria are met and only when we receive evidence that the distribution partner has an order from an end user customer 
we typically do not offer contractual rights of return  stock balancing or price protection to our distribution partners  and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date 
as a result  we do not maintain reserves for product returns and related allowances 
allowance for doubtful accounts we offset gross trade accounts receivable with an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis  and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expense 
if our historical collection experience does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables  our future provision for doubtful accounts could be materially affected 
to date  we have not incurred any significant write offs of accounts receivable and have not been required to revise any of our assumptions or estimates used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires us to recognize expense related to the fair value of stock based compensation awards 
sfas no 
r requires nonpublic companies that used the minimum value method under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for either recognition or pro forma disclosures to apply sfas no 
r using the prospective transition method 
as such  we continue to apply accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees to equity awards outstanding at the date of sfas no 
r s adoption that were measured using the minimum value method 
effective with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of stock options granted 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we recognize the compensation cost of stock based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
as there was no public market for our common stock prior the effective date of the our ipo  we determined the volatility for options granted in  and based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that issued options with substantially similar terms 
the expected volatility of options granted has been determined using an average of the historical volatility measures of this peer group of companies  as well as the historical volatility of our common stock beginning january the expected life of options has been determined utilizing the simplified method as prescribed by the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
the risk free interest 
table of contents rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires companies to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period  whereas  sfas no 
permitted companies to record forfeitures based on actual forfeitures  which was our historical policy under sfas no 
as a result  we applied an estimated forfeiture rate of   and for the years ended december   and  respectively  in determining the expense recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock option awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
inventory we recognize inventory losses based on obsolescence and levels in excess of forecasted demand 
in these cases  inventory is written down to its estimated realizable value based on historical usage and expected demand 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products and technical obsolescence of our products 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs could be required and would be reflected in the cost of revenue in the period the revision is made 
to date  we have not been required to revise any of our assumptions or estimates used in determining our inventory valuations 
when products have been delivered  but the product revenue associated with the arrangement has been deferred as a result of not meeting the revenue recognition criteria required by sop  we also defer the related inventory costs for the delivered items 
product warranties substantially all of our products are covered by a standard warranty of days for software and one year for hardware 
in the event of a failure of hardware or software covered by this warranty  we must repair or replace the hardware or software or  if those remedies are insufficient  and at our discretion  provide a refund 
our customers typically purchase maintenance and support contracts  which encompass our warranty obligations 
our warranty reserve reflects estimated material and labor costs for potential or actual product issues in our installed base that are not covered under maintenance contracts  but for which we expect to incur an obligation 
our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs are primarily based on historical information and future forecasts 
we periodically assess the adequacy of the warranty allowance and adjust the amount as necessary 
during the years ended december  and we decreased our warranty allowance by  and  respectively  as a result of an analysis performed on historical data 
if the historical data we use to calculate the adequacy of the warranty allowance is not indicative of future requirements  additional or reduced warranty reserves may be required 
some of our arrangements with customers include clauses whereby we may be subject to penalties for failure to meet certain performance obligations 
we have not incurred any such penalties to date 
research and development expense for software products research and development expense includes costs incurred to develop intellectual property 
the costs for the development of new software and substantial enhancements to existing software are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional costs would be capitalized 
we have determined that technological feasibility is established at the time a working model of software is completed 
because we believe our current process for developing software will be essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  no costs have been capitalized to date 

table of contents income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and international jurisdictions  and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which is the asset and liability method for accounting and reporting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using statutory rates 
this process requires us to project our current tax liability and estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities  including net operating loss  or nol  and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered our recent operating results  future taxable income projections and feasible tax planning strategies 
we adopted the provisions of fin  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
at the adoption date and as of december   we had no material unrecognized tax benefits and no adjustments to liabilities or operations were required 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue year ended december  period to period change amount percentage of total revenue amount percentage of total revenue amount percentage dollars in thousands revenue by type product revenue maintenance  support and service revenue total revenue revenue by geography united states and canada international total revenue revenue by sales channel direct indirect total revenue the million decrease in product revenue was a result of a decrease in the number of systems sold in as compared to we believe that the decrease in systems sold was the result of temporary delays in the purchasing decisions of our end user customers  which began in the second quarter of  and is not indicative of an overall decline in the worldwide market for our products 
direct product revenues increased by  primarily as a result of a million increase 
table of contents attributable to our united states and canadian customers  partially offset by a decrease of million in product revenues related to our international customers 
indirect product revenues decreased million  with million and  contributed by our international and united states and canadian customers  respectively 
while the decrease in the number of units shipped had an adverse effect on our product revenues in  the decline was partially offset by an increase in the average selling price of our systems due to changes in our product software configuration mix and an increase in the level of software license upgrades 
the product configuration  which reflects the mix of session capacity and requested features  determines the price for each sbc sold 
customers can license our software in various configurations  depending on the customers requirements for session capacity  feature groups and protocols 
the product software configuration mix will have a direct impact on the average selling price of the system sold 
systems with higher software content higher session capacity and a larger number of feature groups will generally have a higher average selling price than those systems sold with less software content 
the million increase in maintenance  support and service revenue was attributable primarily to an increase in maintenance and support fees associated with the growth in our installed product base 
installation and training revenue  including reimbursable travel expenses remained relatively unchanged in as compared to cost of revenue and gross profit year ended december  period to period change amount percentage of related revenue amount percentage of related revenue amount percentage dollars in thousands cost of revenue product maintenance  support and service total cost of revenue gross profit product maintenance  support and service total gross profit the  increase in product cost of revenue was attributable to an increase of  in reserves for excess and obsolete inventory in as compared to  higher salaries  benefits and overhead associated with an increase in manufacturing personnel  including an increase of  in salaries and related benefits and an increase of  in stock based compensation expense  and an increase in the average cost of systems sold in the average cost of systems sold varies based on the product platform mix of items sold in a period 
these cost increases were partially offset by the lower number of systems shipped in as compared to the  increase in cost of maintenance  support and service revenue was due to higher salaries  benefits and overhead associated with increases in support and training personnel  including a  increase in salaries and related benefits and a  increase in stock based compensation expense 
product gross margin decreased by percentage points  primarily due to a decrease in the number of units sold in as compared to which resulted in cost associated with our internal 
table of contents manufacturing efforts being absorbed by a lower product volume base 
the increase in average cost of systems sold in due to product platform mix was also a factor 
we expect our gross margin in the future to decrease  as we expect to experience increased price pressure on our products as the market for our products continues to develop and grow

gross margin on maintenance  support and service revenue increased by percentage points as a result of an increase in maintenance  support and service revenue associated with the growth in our installed product base without a corresponding increase in costs 
we expect cost of product revenue and cost of maintenance  support and service revenue each to increase at approximately the same rate as the related revenue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we expect that gross profit on product revenue and gross profit on maintenance  support and service revenue will each increase  but that the related gross margin will decrease slightly in the long term

we currently expect to realize recorded deferred tax assets as of december  of approximately million 
our conclusion that such assets will be recovered is based upon taxable income previously recorded in the carryback period and our expectation that future earnings will provide sufficient taxable income to realize recorded tax assets

table of contents these tax assets may be applied is not sufficient or carrybacks are eliminated  some or all of our net recorded deferred tax assets would not be realizable

table of contents for the year ended december   our effective tax rate was 
in the year ended december   we recorded a net benefit from income taxes in the amount of million 
the lower effective tax rate in was due to the utilization of previously unrecognized nols to offset our federal obligations 
during  based on a number of factors  including recent operating results  future taxable income projections and feasible tax planning strategies  we determined that in addition to the utilization of the remaining portion of our nol carryforwards to reduce taxable income in  it was more likely than not that we would realize all of our deferred tax assets  and therefore we reduced our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by million 
this benefit of the release in the valuation allowance was recognized through a reduction of income tax expense 
as a result  our effective tax rate for decreased to an effective tax benefit of 
liquidity and capital resources resources since  we have funded our operations principally with cash provided by operations  which was driven by growth in revenue 
in october  we completed an initial public offering  or ipo  of our common stock in which we sold and issued million shares of our common stock  including million shares sold by us pursuant to the underwriters full exercise of their over allotment option  at an issue price of per share 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds from the ipo  or million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of million 
key measures of our liquidity are as follows as of and for the year ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable  net working capital cash provided by operating activities cash used in provided by financing activities certain amounts totaling million and  related to advance billings for maintenance contract renewals previously recorded as an increase to accounts receivable and deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively  have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year presentation 
these amounts have been removed from both account balances because as of those dates  no amounts were collected from the customer and neither party has completed its obligations pursuant to the arrangement 
this reclassification had no impact on previously reported results of operations or cash flows from operations 
cash and cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  were held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in money market funds 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
restricted cash  which totaled   and  at december    and  respectively  and is not included in cash and cash equivalents  was held in certificates of deposit as collateral for letters of credit related to the lease agreements for our corporate headquarters in burlington  massachusetts and our sales office in madrid  spain 
accounts receivable  net 
our accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period to period  which affects our cash flow from operating activities 
the fluctuations vary depending on the timing of our 
table of contents shipping and billing activity  cash collections  and changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in some situations we receive cash payment from a customer prior to the time we are able to recognize revenue on a transaction 
we record these payments as deferred revenue  which has a positive effect on our accounts receivable balances 
we use days sales outstanding  or dso  calculated on a quarterly basis  as a measurement of the quality and status of our receivables 
we define dso as a accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  divided by total revenue for the most recent quarter  multiplied by b days 
dso was days at december  and days at december  the slight decrease in dso at december  was primarily attributable to the timing of shipments during the three months ended december  operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non cash items including depreciation and amortization  impairment losses on property and equipment  deferred income taxes  the provision for bad debts  stock based compensation expense  and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities 
cash provided by operating activities in was million and consisted of million of net income  non cash adjustments of million consisting primarily of million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation expense  million in provisions for bad debt  and a  impairment loss on property and equipment  partially offset by million related to the tax savings to the company from the exercise  by employees  of stock options and an increase in our deferred income taxes of million  and million provided by working capital and other activities 
cash provided by working capital and other activities primarily reflected an increase in deferred revenue of million  an increase of  in other current assets and a  increase in accounts receivable  reflecting an overall decrease in revenue in the fourth quarter of compared to  partially offset by an increase of million in inventory and a decrease of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
equity financing activities 
as previously discussed  we completed an ipo of our common stock in october  resulting in net proceeds of million 
in addition  we received proceeds from the issuance of restricted common stock and exercises of common stock options in the amounts of  in  million in and  in net cash used in financing activities in also included million related to the repurchase of  shares of our common stock  inclusive of brokers fees 
in february  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock over the subsequent twelve month period 
in august  our board of directors expanded the common stock repurchase program by authorizing the repurchase of an additional million of our common stock for an aggregate of million 
the purchase of our common stock was executed periodically as market and business conditions warranted on the open market  in negotiated or block trades  or under a rule b plan  which permitted shares to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded for doing so under insider trading laws 
this common stock repurchase program did not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount  or number of shares of common stock  and the program could have been suspended or discontinued at any time 
the common stock repurchase program expired on february  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock subsequent to december  anticipated cash flows 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and our cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of our revenue growth  our introduction of new products and enhancements  and our expansion of sales and marketing and product development activities 
to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings 
we 
table of contents also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies and products that will complement our existing operations 
in the event additional funding is required  and given the current condition of the global financial markets  we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or effect an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
income taxes 
we currently expect to realize recorded deferred tax assets as of december  of million 
our conclusion that such assets will be recovered is based upon its expectation that our future earnings will provide sufficient taxable income to realize recorded tax assets 
while the realization of our net recorded deferred tax assets cannot be assured  to the extent that future taxable income against which these tax assets may be applied is not sufficient or carrybacks are limited  some or all of our net recorded deferred tax assets would not be realizable 
approximately million of the deferred tax asset recorded as of december  is attributable to benefits associated with stock based compensation charges 
under the guidance of sfas no 
r  no valuation allowance has been recorded against this amount 
however  in the future  if the underlying awards expire with an intrinsic value less than the fair value of the awards on the date of grant  some or all of the benefit may not be realizable 
as of december   we had state research and development tax credits of million of which approximately million related to excess tax deductions has been excluded from the above table  the benefit of these credits will be realized as an increase in additional paid in capital when it results in a reduction in state taxable income in accordance with sfas no 
r 
these state tax credits begin to expire in  and are subject to review and possible adjustment by the taxing authorities 
during  we both generated and utilized all of our us federal research and development tax credits 
the internal revenue code contains provisions that limit the nol and tax credit carryforwards available to be used in any given year in the event of certain circumstances  including significant changes in ownership interests  as defined 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
at the adoption date and as of december  and  we had no material unrecognized tax benefits and no adjustments to liabilities  retained earnings or operations were required 
interest costs related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties  if any  are included in the provision for benefit from income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we do not have any accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax provisions as of december  as of december   all of the federal tax returns we have filed for tax years through and including remain subject to examination by tax authorities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk to date  substantially all of our international customer agreements have been denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and do not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
the functional currency of our international operations in europe and asia is the us dollar 
accordingly  all operating assets and liabilities of these international subsidiaries are re measured into us dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses of these international subsidiaries are re measured into us dollars at the average rates in effect during the year 
any differences resulting from the re measurement of assets  liabilities and operations of the european and asian subsidiaries are recorded within other income in the consolidated statements of income 
if the foreign currency exchange rates fluctuated by as of december   our foreign exchange exposure would have fluctuated by approximately  interest rate risk at december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future interest income
