item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and outlook our results of operations are affected primarily by i the level of exploration and development activity maintained by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in the gulf of mexico  and to a lesser extent  foreign locations throughout the world  ii our ability to win contracts through competitive bidding or alliance partnering arrangements  and iii our ability to manage those contracts to successful completion 
the level of exploration and development activity is related to several factors  including trends of oil and natural gas prices  exploration and production companies expectations of future oil and natural gas prices  and changes in technology that reduce costs and improve expected returns on investment 
despite our performance for the twelve months ended december   we expect that the downturn in the industry that began in late brought on by the rapid decline in oil and gas prices will impact our ability to maintain the high levels of performance we have achieved since in july of  the price of oil had exceeded a barrel  but current oil prices have fallen below a barrel 
as a result  oil and gas producers have had substantial reductions in their cash flows  causing most to slash their capital budgets for the dollar value of projects  if available in the market  is significantly below last year s levels and our backlog is similarly eroded 
other projects have been removed from the bidding process as these companies wait for a potential increase in commodity prices 
competition for available projects has become intense and future short term margins will likely diminish 
cost reduction measures will be undertaken as appropriate to meet these conditions 
in the longer term  demand for our products and services will continue to depend largely upon prices for oil and gas  which at this time is difficult to predict 
at some point however  we expect that oil and gas prices will recover as commodity supplies are reduced and our customers are forced to replace them 
backlog our backlog is based on management s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete  and the remaining revenue to be recognized with respect to  those projects as to which a customer has authorized us to begin work or purchase materials pursuant to written contracts  letters of intent or other forms of authorization 
often  however  management s estimates are based on incomplete engineering and design specifications 
as engineering and design plans are finalized or changes to existing plans are made  management s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete and price at completion for such projects is likely to change 
in addition  all projects currently included in our backlog are subject to termination at the option of the customer  although the customer is generally required to pay us for work performed and materials purchased through the date of termination and  in some instances  pay us cancellation fees 
however  due to the large dollar amounts of backlog estimated for certain projects  a termination of any one of these projects could substantially decrease our backlog  and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  net income and cash flow 
as of december   we had a revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of approximately million man hours remaining to work  which consists of work remaining at december  and commitments received through march   compared to the revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of million man hours reported in our form k at december  of the backlog at december   million  or  represented projects destined for deepwater locations compared to million  or  of projects destined for deepwater locations included in the december  backlog 
of the backlog at december   we expect to recognize revenues of approximately million during calendar year  million during calendar year  and the remaining million thereafter 

table of contents 
index to financial statements included in our backlog at december   is million and million man hours associated with the mindoc ii project in which the customer has announced will be postponed and will be utilized at another of their locations sometime in the future 
approximately of the backlog expected to be recognized as revenue in and of the backlog expected to be recognized as revenue in is related to the remaining backlog on the mindoc ii project 
workforce during  our workforce ranged from approximately  to  demand for our products and services dictates our workforce needs 
although we generally try to minimize the use of contract labor  we will use contract labor when required to meet customer demand 
for  our use of contract labor ranged from approximately to contract laborers 
current global economic conditions and the steep decline in oil prices have caused companies to remove projects from the bidding process or reduce the dollar value of projects 
a reduction in available work in the market and declines in profit from work that is available could cause us to undertake cost reduction measures  including a reduction in our workforce 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the ratio of direct labor hours actually performed to date compared to the total estimated direct labor hours required for completion 
accordingly  contract price and cost estimates are reviewed monthly as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised 
if these adjustments were to result in a reduction of previously reported profits  we would have to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
some contracts include a total or partial reimbursement to us of any costs associated with specific capital projects required by the fabrication process 
if a particular capital project provides future benefits to us  the cost to build the capital project will be capitalized  and the revenue for the capital project will increase the estimated profit in the contract 
contract costs include all direct material  labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies and tools 
also included in contract costs are a portion of those indirect contract costs related to plant capacity  such as depreciation  insurance and repairs and maintenance 
these indirect costs are allocated to jobs based on actual direct labor hours incurred 
profit incentives are included in revenue when their realization is reasonably assured 
claims for extra work or changes in scope of work are included in revenue when the amount can be reliably estimated and collection is probable 
at december   we recorded revenue totaling million related to certain change orders  which have been approved as to scope but not price 
at december   we also recorded revenue totaling million related to re measure units  rates and quantities on a unit rate contract that was completed in the fourth quarter 
we are in the process of negotiating resolution of these change orders and re measures with the customers and recovery of the revenue is dependent upon these negotiations 
if we collect amounts different than the million of revenue that has been recorded  that difference will be recognized as income or loss 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined

index to financial statements results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and for the twelve month period ended december   our revenue was million  a decrease of  compared to million in revenue for the twelve month period ended december  the primary factor contributing to this reduction of revenue was the fact that actual material and sub contract costs incurred pass through cost represented of sales for the twelve months ended december   compared to of sales for the twelve months ended december  thus  the majority of the decrease in revenue is associated with the reduction of material and subcontract cost incurred on projects for the twelve months ended december   compared to the twelve months ended december  we consider material and sub contract costs associated with projects as pass through costs because they become a component of revenue  but add little or no margin to a project 
partially offsetting this reduction in revenue was an increase in the billable labor man hours on projects during the year 
for the twelve month period ended december   direct labor man hours were million compared to million for the twelve month period ended december  for the twelve month periods ended december  and  gross profit was million of revenue for and million of revenue for two factors contributed to the increase in gross margin for the twelve months ended december  most of our revenue is recognized by using the percentage of completion method  computed by the efforts expended method  which measures the percentage of labor hours incurred compared to the total estimated labors hours to complete a contract 
consequently  the increase in direct labor man hours million compared to million as mentioned above resulted in an increase in gross margin 
activity levels in required us to increase our reliance on contract labor to maintain sufficient labor levels to complete the major projects in progress 
generally  contract labor employees perform less efficiently than company employees  which is normally due to the amount of training  work experience and turnover 
during  our weighted average number of contract employees was employees compared to contract employees for  a reduction of 
currently  the total number of contract employees in all facilities has been reduced to our general and administrative expenses were million for the twelve month period ended december  this compares to million for the twelve month period ended december  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were of revenue for each of the twelve month periods ended december  and the majority of the reduction in general and administrative expenses for the twelve month period ended december  compared to december  was related to amortization expense 
we incurred amortization expense  through august  which was related to the gulf marine acquisition 
also contributing to the decrease in general and administrative expenses was a reduction in the number of personnel and related cost salaries  wages and benefit related costs 
we had net interest income of  for the twelve month period ended december   compared to net interest income of  for the twelve month period ended december  the reduction in interest income is related to having less cash available for investing combined with lower interest rates earned on investments in compared to in the other section of the other income expense category for and  are net expense losses of  and  respectively  which are related to the sale of miscellaneous equipment

index to financial statements our effective income tax rate was for the twelve month period ended december   compared to for the twelve month period ended december  the decrease in the tax rate is primarily related to the extension and retroactive application of the federal work opportunity tax credit wotc 
comparison of the years ended december  and for the twelve month period ended december   our revenue was million  an increase of  compared to million in revenue for the twelve month period ended december  the majority of the increase in revenue was associated with the acquisition of gulf marine  which enabled us to more fully participate in the market for deepwater projects 
we started the year with a backlog of million  of which three major contracts were being fabricated at our gulf marine facility in south texas 
in addition  two of these three major contracts required large material cost outlay during these material costs passed directly to revenue 
for the twelve month period ended december   direct labor man hours were million compared to million for the twelve month period ended december  for the twelve month period ended december   gross profit was million of revenue compared to gross profit of million of revenue for the twelve months ended december  although gross profit increased for compared to the same period in  the gross profit margins in decreased 
this decrease in gross profit margin was caused by a substantially greater amount of pass through costs  with no associated profit  included in the revenue and costs for the twelve months of compared to the same period of and was also caused by increased labor costs primarily due to our reliance on contract labor to maintain sufficient labor levels to complete the major projects in progress 
during  our weighted average number of contract employees was employees compared to contract employees for  an increase of 
material and subcontract costs represented of the direct cost of sales for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december  although we have normal escalation clauses in the larger contracts for material and labor  the dramatic increases post hurricanes katrina and rita in labor rates with the simultaneous increased demand for labor in the upstream and downstream sectors of the fabrication business  has caused an abnormal increase in labor rates for skilled labor 
we continue to negotiate with our customers in an attempt to neutralize additional increases in labor  material and subcontract costs  but we can not ensure that any of these additional costs will be reimbursed 
our general and administrative expenses were million for the twelve month period ended december  this compares to million for the twelve month period ended december  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to  from of revenue  for the twelve month periods ended december  and december   respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses are directly related to increases in the number of personnel and related cost salaries  wages and benefit related costs normally associated with increases in production volumes 
we had net interest income of  for the twelve month period ended december   compared to net interest expense of  for the twelve month period ended december  the change is primarily the result of borrowings incurred by us related to the acquisition of  and additional capital expenditures for  gulf marine 
in the other section of the other income expense category for is a net expense of  related to the sale of miscellaneous equipment 
in the other section of the other income expense category for is net income of million 
the majority of this income was the result of the sale of our interest in mindoc  which was effective january   and which generated a gain of approximately million 
the remainder was from the gain on the sale of other fixed assets 
our effective income tax rate was for the twelve month period ended december   compared to for the twelve month period ended december  the increase relates primarily to the employment hiring credits available to us in for both state and federal taxes that phased out in the third and fourth quarters of

index to financial statements liquidity and capital resources historically we have funded our business activities through funds generated from operations 
effective august   we entered into the seventh amendment to the ninth amended and restated credit agreement the revolver which  among other things  increased the amount of the revolver from million to million and extended the term of the revolver from december  to december  the revolver is secured by our real estate  machinery and equipment  and fixtures  and amounts borrowed under the revolver bear interest  at our option  at the prime lending rate established by jpmorgan chase bank  na or libor plus 
we pay a fee on a quarterly basis of three sixteenths of one percent per annum on the weighted average unused portion of the revolver 
at december   no amounts were borrowed under the revolver  but we had letters of credit outstanding totaling million  which reduced the unused portion of the revolver 
more of our customers  especially in larger fabrication projects  are requiring us to issue letters of credit in lieu of retainage 
thus  we are issuing letters of credit for larger amounts and for longer periods of time than we did in past years 
we are required to maintain certain covenants  including balance sheet and cash flow ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to at december  working capital was million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  there were several factors contributing to the reduction of cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  the cash effect of billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts bie for the year ended december  was  used in operating activities as compared to million provided by operating activities for the year ended december  changes in bie for a particular year closely follow our change in revenue for the year 
for the year ended december   revenue was million as compared to million and million for the year ended december  and respectively 
changes in bie are further affected by the percentage of pass through costs included in revenue 
pass through costs add little or no margin to revenue recognized  however  we bill our customers for purchases of materials and outside services incurred in the early phases of a project as soon as the contract allows 
pass through costs  as a percentage of revenue  for the year ended december   were compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this affect is partially offset by million of bie at december  representing advance billings to a customer to purchase material as our contract allows 
since the material was not received at december   revenue was not recognized for this amount in the timing of our estimated income tax payments during as compared to also contributed to the reduction of cash flows provided by operating activities 
income taxes paid  net of refunds  were million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  at december   we recorded million in other receivables as the result of two insurance claims 
the insurance claims are for damages and related costs for an accident in our texas facility involving four cranes and the damages related to hurricanes gustav and ike 
at december   we have recorded a reserve  in accrued liabilities  for various deductibles of million related to these insurance claims 
since december   we have collected million related to these claims 
we continue to provide supporting documentation to the insurance company on the remaining million of claims currently being processed 
until all property is restored to pre damaged condition  we will incur cost for repairs and adjust deductibles accordingly 
the net effect of these 
table of contents 
index to financial statements outstanding insurance claims at december   resulted in a million decrease in cash provided by operating activities as compared to no activity for the year ended december  the million of net cash used in financing activities for the period ended december  was made up of  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and  of tax benefit from the exercise of stock options less million in payments of dividends on common stock 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  of which the entire amount was for capital expenditures for improvements to our production facilities and for equipment designed to increase the capacity of our facilities and the productivity of our labor force 
included in capital expenditures for was million related to the remaining phase i cost to construct the graving dock at our gulf marine facilities and million representing approximately two thirds of the cost of phase ii of the graving dock 
phase ii of the construction of the graving dock will be completed in mid to late april also included in capital expenditures for were million on the panel line system and million on the dry dock as described in items and business and property our board of directors approved a capital budget of approximately million for  which includes the purchase of equipment and additional yard and facility infrastructure improvements 
the capital expenditure budget has been reduced in compared to the last two years because of current global economic conditions in the industry 
capital projects could further be reduced if available work in the market declines 
included in the capital expenditure budget is million for the remaining cost to complete the dry dock and million to complete the purchase and installation of equipment for a panel line system 
the dry dock and the panel line will facilitate our expansion into additional marine construction areas such as towboats  barges and mid body sections for offshore supply vessels 
management believes that during the next months our available funds  cash generated by operating activities and funds available under the bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures and working capital needs 
however  we may expand our operations through acquisitions in the future  which may require additional equity or debt financing 
also  job awards may require us to issue additional letters of credit  further reducing the unused portion of the revolver
