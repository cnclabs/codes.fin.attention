item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview adtran  inc designs  manufactures  markets and services network access solutions for communications networks 
our solutions are widely deployed by providers of telecommunications services serviced by our carrier networks division  and small and mid sized businesses and enterprises serviced by our enterprise networks division  and enable voice  data  video and internet communications across copper  fiber and wireless networks 
many of these solutions are currently in use by every major united states service provider and many global ones  as well as by many public  private and governmental organizations worldwide 
our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors 
an important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then lower the product s selling price based on the cost savings achieved in order to gain market share and or improve gross margins 
as a part of this strategy  we seek in most instances to be a high quality  low cost provider of products in our markets 
our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign  allowing both increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation 
this strategy enables us to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers  while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers 
our three major product categories are carrier systems  business networking and loop access 
carrier systems products are used by telecommunications service providers to provide last mile access in support of data  voice and video services to consumers and enterprises 
the carrier systems category includes our broadband access products comprising total access multi access and aggregation platform products  fiber to the node fttn products and digital subscriber line access multiplexer dslam products 
our broadband access products are used by service providers to deliver high speed internet access  voice over internet protocol voip  ip television iptv  and or ethernet services from central office or remote terminal locations to customer premises 
the carrier systems category also includes our optical access products 
these products consist of optical access multiplexers including our family of opti products 
optical access products are used to deliver higher bandwidth services  or to aggregate large numbers of low bandwidth services for transportation across fiber optic infrastructure 
total access products  concentrator products  m multiplexer products and wireless network backhaul products are also included in the carrier systems product category 
business networking products provide enterprises access to telecommunication networks and facilitate networking capabilities for voice  data and video networks 
the business networking category includes internetworking products and integrated access devices iads 
internetworking products consist of our ip business gateways and netvanta product lines 
netvanta products include ip multi service access routers  ethernet switches  internet security firewall appliances  ip private branch exchange pbx products  ip phone products and carrier ethernet network terminating equipment 
loop access products are used by carrier and enterprise customers for access to copper based telecommunications network 
the loop access category includes products such as digital data service dds and integrated services digital network total reach products  high bit rate digital subscriber line hdsl products including total access based hdsl and time division multiplexed symmetrical hdsl tdm shdsl products  t e t  channel service units data service units  and tracer fixed wireless products 
in addition  we identify sub categories of product revenues  which we divide into growth products  representing our primary growth areas  and traditional products 
our growth products consist of broadband access and optical access products included in carrier systems and internetworking products included in business networking and our traditional products include hdsl products included in loop access and other products 
many of our customers are migrating their networks to deliver higher bandwidth services by utilizing newer technologies 
we believe that products in our primary growth areas position us well for this migration 
we anticipate that revenues of many of our traditional products  including hdsl  may continue for years because of the time required for our customers to transition to newer technologies 
sales were million in compared to million in and million in sales increased in each of our primary growth areas  broadband access  optical access and internetworking 
total sales of products in these three growth areas increased in compared to and in compared to our gross profit margin improved in to from in and in  and our operating income margin increased to in compared to in and in net income was million in compared to million in and million in earnings per share  assuming dilution  were in compared to in and in earnings per share in  and reflect the repurchase of million  million and million shares of our stock  respectively 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past  and may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors 
we normally operate with very little order backlog 
a majority of our sales in each quarter result from orders booked in that quarter and firm purchase orders released in that quarter by customers under agreements containing non binding purchase commitments 
many of our customers require prompt delivery of products 
this results in a limited backlog of orders for these products and requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand 
if near term demand for our products declines  or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated  our financial results could be adversely affected 
operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  therefore  a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter 
beginning in the latter part of the third quarter of and extending through the fourth quarter of  we experienced an overall decline in order rates across most of our product categories 
we believe this decline in order rates was the result of slowing macroeconomic conditions  coupled with the fact that our sales in the fourth quarter of each year have typically been lower than our sales in the preceding third quarter due to seasonality 
our sales in the first quarter of each year have also typically been lower than our sales in the second and third quarters of the previous year due to seasonality 
our operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors  including a decline in general economic and market conditions  increased competition  customer order patterns  changes in product mix  timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions  product warranty returns  and announcements of new products by us or our competitors 
additionally  maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
also  not maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements  which may impact our operating results in a given quarter 
accordingly  our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results  and  in general  management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of risks associated with our operating results  see item a of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the results of financial operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied across our two reportable segments carrier networks division and enterprise networks division 
we review customer contracts to determine if all of the requirements for revenue recognition have been met prior to recording revenues from sales transactions 
we generally record sales revenue upon shipment of our products  net of any rebates or discounts  since i we generally do not have significant post delivery obligations  ii the product price is fixed or determinable  iii collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and iv product returns are reasonably estimable 
we generally ship products upon receipt of a purchase order from a customer 
we evaluate shipping terms and we record revenue on products shipped in accordance with the terms of each respective contract where applicable  or under our standard shipping terms for purchase orders accepted without a contract  generally fob shipping point 
in the case of consigned inventory  revenue is recognized when the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the product 
when contracts contain multiple elements  contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element contract should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and  if so  how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we record revenue associated with installation services when the installation and all contractual obligations are complete 
when contracts include both installation and product sales  the installation is considered as a separate deliverable item 
either the purchaser  adtran  or a third party can perform installation of our products 
revenues related to maintenance services are recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
sales returns are accrued based on historical sales return experience  which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of future returns 
the majority of enterprise networks products are sold in the united states through a non exclusive distribution network of major technology distributors 
these organizations then distribute to an extensive network of value added resellers and system integrators 
value added resellers and system integrators may be affiliated with us as a channel 
table of contents 
index to financial statements partner  or they may purchase from the distributor in an unaffiliated fashion 
additionally  with certain limitations  our distributors may return unused and unopened product for stock balancing purposes when these returns are accompanied by offsetting orders for products of equal or greater value 
we participate in cooperative advertising and market development programs with certain customers 
we use these programs to reimburse customers for certain forms of advertising  and in general  to allow our customers credits up to a specified percentage of their net purchases 
our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we also participate in rebate programs to provide sales incentives for certain products 
our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
prior to issuing payment terms to a new customer  we perform a detailed credit review of the customer 
credit limits are established for each new customer based on the results of this credit review 
payment terms are established for each new customer  and collection experience is reviewed periodically in order to determine if the customer s payment terms and credit limits need to be revised 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we may be required to make additional allowances 
if circumstances change with regard to individual receivable balances that have previously been determined to be uncollectible and for which a specific reserve has been established  a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  at december  and  at december  we carry our inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we use standard costs for material  labor  and manufacturing overhead to value our inventory 
our standard costs are updated on at least a quarterly basis and any variances are expensed in the current period  therefore  our inventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to make additional inventory write downs 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
inventory write downs charged to the reserve were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the objective of our short term investment policy is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity with appropriate diversification  while emphasizing market returns on our monetary assets 
the objective of our long term investment policy is principal preservation and total return  that is  the aggregate return from capital appreciation  dividend income  and interest income 
these objectives are achieved through investments with appropriate diversification in fixed and variable rate income securities  public equity  and private equity portfolios 
we have experienced significant volatility in the market prices of our publicly traded equity investments 
these investments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the ultimate realized value on these equity investments is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  we have categorized our cash equivalents held in money market funds and our investments held at fair value into a three level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique for the cash equivalents and investments as follows level values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market  level values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  level values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
these inputs include information supplied by investees 
at december   we categorized million and million of our available for sale investments as level and level  respectively  and million of our cash equivalents as level we review our investment portfolio for potential other than temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  significant declines in value which may be considered other than temporary and  if necessary  recognize and record the appropriate charge to write down the carrying value of such investments 
in making this assessment  we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information  including but not limited to the following the magnitude and duration of historical declines in market prices  credit rating activity  assessments of liquidity  public filings  and statements made by the issuer 
we generally begin our identification of potential other than temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by more than for more than six months 
we then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of the write down  if any 
because of the strained credit markets and deterioration in the equity markets experienced in the fourth quarter of  we expanded the impairment review of our investments to assess the impact of these factors on our ability to recover our cost in every security whose value had declined from its original or adjusted cost by more than  regardless of the duration of the historical decline 
we then evaluated the individual security to determine the amount of write down  if any 
as a result  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of related to marketable equity securities 
as long as current market conditions continue to exist  we will continue to complete a similar review of individual securities for impairment each quarter 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded charges of million  million and million  respectively  related to the other than temporary impairment of certain publicly traded equity securities 
actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ from these estimates 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report for more information about our investments 
we also invest in privately held entities and private equity funds and record these investments at cost 
we review these investments periodically in order to determine if circumstances both financial and non financial exist that indicate that we will not recover our initial investment 
impairment charges are recorded on investments having a cost basis that is greater than the value that we would reasonably expect to receive in an arm s length sale of the investment 
we have not been required to record any losses relating to these investments in  or for purposes of determining the estimated fair value of our stock option awards on the date of grant under sfas no 
revised  share based payments  sfas r  we use the black scholes model 
this model requires the input of certain assumptions that require subjective judgment 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
because our stock option awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  the existing model may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our stock option awards 
for purposes of determining the estimated fair value of our performance based restricted stock unit awards on the date of grant  we use the monte carlo simulation valuation technique 
management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock based compensation 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination 
if factors change and we use different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
we estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we also make judgments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets which we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our estimates regarding future taxable income and income tax provision or benefit may vary due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  or other factors 
if our assumptions  and consequently our estimates  change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  impacting future income tax expense 
for and respectively  the valuation allowance was million and million 
as of december   we have state research tax credit carry forwards of million  which will expire between and these carry forwards were caused by tax credits in excess of our annual tax liabilities to an individual state where we no longer generate sufficient state income 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we believe it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of our deferred tax asset arising from these credits  and accordingly  have provided a valuation allowance 
this valuation allowance is included in non current deferred tax liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 
our products generally include warranties of one to ten years for product defects 
we accrue for warranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to systems products 
these products will require more warranty repairs to be completed at the installed location due to their size and complexity  rather than at a manufacturing site or repair depot 
this field service obligation  as well as the increasing complexity of our products  will cause warranty incidences  when they arise  to be more costly 
our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates  material usage  and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be recorded if 
table of contents 
index to financial statements unforeseen problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates  we will be required to record additional warranty expense 
alternatively  if we provide for more reserves than we require  we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
the liability for warranty returns totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
these liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

enterprise networks cost of sales  as a percent of division sales  increased from in to in the increase was primarily related to a higher cost product mix plus the impact of allocated manufacturing costs to the division 
an important part of our strategy is to reduce the product cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product s price based on the cost savings achieved 
this strategy sometimes results in variations in our gross profit margin due to timing differences between the recognition of cost reductions and the lowering of product selling prices 
in view of the rapid pace of new product introductions by our company  this strategy may result in variations in gross profit margins that  for any particular financial period  can be difficult to predict

our municipal variable rate demand notes are classified as available for sale short term investments and had a credit rating of a or vmig at december  despite the long term nature of their stated contractual maturities  we believe that we have the ability to quickly liquidate these securities 
our investments in these securities are recorded at fair value and the interest rates reset every seven days 
as a result  we had no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains losses or gross realized gains losses from these investments 
all income generated from these investments was recorded as interest income 
we have not been required to record any losses relating to municipal variable rate demand notes or auction rate securities  and we have held no municipal auction rate securities since february  at december   approximately of our municipal fixed rate bond portfolio had a credit rating of aaa and had a credit rating of aa 
these bonds are classified as available for sale investments and had an average duration of years at december  because our bond portfolio has a high quality rating and contractual maturities of a short duration  we are able to obtain prices for these bonds derived from observable market inputs  or for similar securities traded in an active market  on a daily basis

we generally begin our identification of potential other than temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by more than for more than six months 
we then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write down  if any
