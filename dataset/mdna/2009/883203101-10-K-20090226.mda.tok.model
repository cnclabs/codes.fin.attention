item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview revenues increased to billion  while segment profit decreased to billion in  compared with the revenue increase was largely due to the acquisition of aai corporation aai  higher volume in our aerospace and defense businesses  and pricing 
the decrease in segment profit was largely due to higher loan loss provisions in the commercial finance business  partially offset by the impact of the higher volume and pricing 
see pages through for more discussion of these changes on a consolidated basis and by segment 
during the second half of the year  turmoil in the capital markets and the deepening recession significantly impacted many of our businesses 
on december   we announced our current plan to exit the non captive commercial finance business in the finance segment 
we also announced a restructuring program designed to reduce costs across the company 
this program  together with other volume related reductions in workforce announced through january  will eliminate approximately of our workforce worldwide 
as a result of the exit plan and the restructuring program  we incurred special charges totaling million in the fourth quarter of these charges included a million charge to mark to market finance receivables now designated as held for sale  a million impairment charge to write off all of the finance segment s goodwill and million in restructuring charges 
see page for a discussion of these special charges 
earnings per share from continuing operations decreased largely due to the special charges and a million tax charge related to the change in investment status of a canadian subsidiary in the finance segment  which had a combined impact of per share  and lower segment profit  largely reflecting an increase in loan loss provisions at our finance segment 
backlog at the end of totaled billion  a increase from the prior year 
bell s backlog increased billion in  largely due to the v multi year contract  and cessna s backlog increased billion  largely due to orders received for the wide body long range citation columbus jet 
at cessna  while generally only firm aircraft orders for which we have received deposits are included in backlog  we have experienced deferrals that delay the delivery of commercial aircraft to later years  as well as cancellations of orders within backlog 
see the backlog section on page for more information 
for  we have lowered our planned jet production level based on our current estimates 
we expect ongoing volatility in the timing of fulfillment of our cessna backlog until economic conditions stabilize 
our industrial segment saw volume decline in most of its businesses as demand softened  with the largest decline at kautex  reflecting numerous automotive original equipment manufacturers oem factory shutdowns around the world 
volume at e z go increased largely due to increased fleet car sales related to the successful introduction of our new rxv model 
our defense businesses have buffered some of the impact of the economy through programs with the us government 
at textron systems  revenues increased largely due to the acquisition of aai and continued demand for armored security vehicles asv and other products 
while bell experienced the loss of the armed reconnaissance helicopter arh program in the fourth quarter of  bell s v and h programs are performing as expected 
we shipped four more v aircraft and two more h aircraft in  compared with due to the current economic environment  we have experienced higher borrowing cost and  at times  limited access to the capital markets 
in february  we drew down on the balance of our billion committed bank lines of credit to pay off our outstanding commercial paper and to provide us with additional liquidity during these uncertain times 
see the recent developments section on pages and for a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources 
bar chart consolidated results of operations in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group  changes in revenue and segment profit are typically expressed in terms of volume  pricing  foreign exchange and acquisitions 
additionally  changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix  inflation and cost performance 
volume represents changes in the number of units delivered or services provided 
pricing represents changes in unit pricing 
foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreign denominated amounts into us dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period 
acquisitions refer to the results generated from businesses that were acquired within the previous months 
for segment profit  mix represents a change due to the composition of products and or services sold at different profit margins 
inflation represents higher material  wages  benefits or other costs 
cost performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development  depreciation  warranty  product liability  quality scrap  labor efficiency  overhead  product line profitability  start up  ramp up and cost reduction initiatives  or other manufacturing inputs 
for us government business  performance generally refers to changes in estimated contract rates 
these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs to complete a contract that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on the contract  and are recognized by recording cumulative catch up adjustments in the current period 
revenues revenues increased billion  or  to billion in  compared with this increase is primarily due to the following factors in our manufacturing businesses  which were partially offset by lower revenues in the commercial finance business of million additional revenues from newly acquired businesses of million  primarily the acquisition of aai at textron systems  higher manufacturing volume of million  reflecting million in higher volume at cessna  primarily related to an increase in business jet deliveries  million in higher volume at bell  largely related to the v and h programs  and million in increased volume at textron systems from higher asv aftermarket  lycoming and intelligent battlefield systems ibs products  partially offset by million decrease in the industrial segment  principally due to lower demand at kautex  higher pricing of million  with million at cessna  million at bell and million in the industrial segment  and favorable foreign exchange impact of million in the industrial segment 
revenues increased billion  or  to billion in  compared with the primary reasons for this increase are higher manufacturing volume of billion  reflecting million in higher volume at cessna  primarily related to an increase in business jet deliveries  million increase in the industrial segment  principally due to higher demand at kautex  million in higher volume at bell  largely related to the h program  and million in increased volume at textron systems from higher asv deliveries  higher pricing of million  with million at cessna  million in bell s commercial business and million in the industrial segment  additional revenues from newly acquired businesses of million  primarily the acquisitions of overwatch systems and aai  favorable foreign exchange impact of million in the industrial segment  and a million impact from higher average finance receivables due to growth in the aviation and resort finance businesses in the finance segment 
segment profit segment profit decreased million  or  to billion in  compared with this decrease is primarily due to million in reduced profits in the finance segment  largely due to an increase in the provision for loan losses of million  partially offset by the following factors a million benefit from higher volume and mix reflecting million in higher volume at cessna  primarily related to an increase in business jet deliveries  offset by million in lower volume and mix in the industrial segment  million in profit from newly acquired businesses  and million in pricing in excess of inflation reflecting million in pricing in excess of inflation at cessna and million at bell  partially offset by million in inflation in excess of pricing at industrial

special charges special charges for the year ended january   include an initial mark to market adjustment of million that was made when we reclassified certain finance receivables from held for investment to held for sale  a goodwill impairment charge in the finance segment of million and restructuring charges of million 
there were no special charges in fiscal or as a result of the volatility and disruption in the credit markets  and in order to reduce our reliance on short term funding  on october   our board of directors approved the recommendation of management to downsize the finance segment 
the plan approved at that time entailed exiting the finance group s asset based lending and structured capital businesses  as well as several additional product lines  and limiting new originations in the distribution finance  golf finance and resort finance businesses 
on december   our board of directors approved a plan to exit all of the commercial finance business of the finance segment  other than that portion of the business supporting customer purchases of textron manufactured products 
we made the decision to exit this business due to continued weakness in the economy and in order to address our long term liquidity position in light of continuing disruption and instability in the capital markets 
in total  these actions will impact approximately billion of the finance segment s billion managed receivable portfolio as of the end of the exit plan will be effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales and is expected to be substantially complete over the next two to four years 
we recorded a pre tax mark to market adjustment of million against owned receivables held for sale due to the exit plan 
at january   approximately billion of the liquidating receivables were designated for sale or transfer  of which about billion represent securitized receivables managed by the finance segment  and billion represent owned receivables classified as held for sale 
based on current market conditions and the plan to downsize the finance segment  we recorded a million pre tax impairment charge in the fourth quarter of to eliminate all goodwill at the finance segment 
in october  we initiated a restructuring program to reduce overhead cost and improve productivity across the company 
on december   the textron board of directors approved an expansion of this previously announced plan  which includes corporate and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions and streamlining of administrative overhead 
the program  along with other volume related reductions in workforce during the fourth quarter of and in january  eliminates approximately  positions worldwide  representing approximately of our global workforce 
we recorded pre tax restructuring costs of million in the fourth quarter of related to this restructuring program and the finance segment exit plan  excluding volume related direct labor reductions  which are recorded in segment profit 
in the first half of  we estimate that we will incur an additional million in pre tax restructuring costs  largely related to workforce reductions at cessna 
we may have additional restructuring costs as a result of further headcount reductions and other actions  however  an estimate of additional charges cannot be made at this time 
special charges by segment for the year ended january  are as follows restructuring charges total severance contract asset total other special in millions costs terminations impairments restructuring charges charges cessna textron systems industrial finance corporate corporate expenses and other  net corporate expenses and other  net decreased million in  compared with  primarily due to lower compensation expenses  largely caused by stock depreciation 
corporate expenses and other  net increased million in  compared with  primarily due to million of higher compensation expenses  largely related to stock appreciation  million of higher professional and consulting fees for corporate initiatives  million of increased costs for divested operations  primarily due to higher pension costs and other retained liabilities  and a million increase in our contribution to the textron charitable trust  partially offset by an million gain on an insurance settlement 
interest expense interest expense for the manufacturing group increased million to million in  compared with  primarily due to higher borrowing costs associated with our commercial paper borrowing in income taxes the following table reconciles the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate federal statutory income tax rate increase decrease in taxes resulting from state income taxes goodwill impairment favorable tax settlements canadian dollar functional currency non us tax rate differential manufacturing deduction equity hedge loss income tax contingencies and related interest change in status of non us subsidiary research credit other  net effective income tax rate in  the effective income tax rate was significantly impacted by the plan announced in the fourth quarter of to exit portions of the finance segment s business 
this plan resulted in the impairment of all of the finance segment s goodwill  of which only a small portion was deductible for tax purposes 
in addition  due to the change in the investment status of the finance segment s canadian subsidiary  we incurred million in additional tax expense 
discontinued operations in november  we completed the sale of our fluid power business unit to clyde blowers limited  a uk based worldwide leader in the areas of power  materials handling  intermodal transport and logistics  and pump technologies 
this sale included our gear technologies  hydraulics  maag pump and union pump product lines  along with each of their respective brands 
we received approximately million in cash  a six year note with a face value of million and up to million based on final operating results that will be determined by the end of the first quarter of  which will be primarily payable in a six year note 
we recorded an after tax gain of million for this sale 
after taxes and other deal related expenses are paid  we expect total net after tax proceeds for the sale to be approximately million  excluding any payments due to us related to the operating results 
in august  we completed the sale of our fastening systems business to platinum equity  a private equity investment firm  for approximately million in cash and the assumption of million of net indebtedness and certain liabilities 
there was no gain or loss recorded upon completion of the sale 
prior to the consummation of the sale of the fastening systems business  we recorded an impairment charge of million in to record the business at the estimated fair value less cost to sell 
the fluid power and fastening systems businesses met the discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements 
the results of the fluid power business were previously reported in the industrial segment

prior to  we reported segment financial results within four segments bell  cessna  industrial and finance 
we changed our segment reporting to separate textron systems into a new segment  initially named defense intelligence  and to report bell helicopter as its own segment  bell  to reflect the manner in which we now manage these businesses 
all periods presented herein have been recast to reflect the segment reporting structure 
segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision making purposes 
segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense  certain corporate expenses and special charges 
the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense and excludes special charges 
cessna dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin backlog cessna revenues cessna s revenues increased million in  compared with  due to higher volume of million  higher pricing of million and a benefit from a newly acquired business of million 
the higher volume primarily reflects higher jet and caravan deliveries of million  partially offset by lower used aircraft sales of million and lower single engine sales of million 
citation business jets are the largest component of cessna s revenues 
we delivered  and citation business jets in  and  respectively 
however  we do not expect the level of revenue growth we have experienced over the last three years to continue in the near future 
due to recent deferrals from deliveries and cancellations  as discussed in the backlog section on page  cessna has reduced its production plan from levels 
as a result of reduced production levels  cessna announced reductions in workforce by approximately employees in the fourth quarter of and an additional  employees in january cessna s backlog increased billion  primarily due to billion in orders received for the wide body  long range citation columbus jet  which began a multi year development period in in  cessna s revenues increased million  compared with  due to higher volume of million  primarily due to higher citation business jet deliveries  and improved pricing of million 
cessna segment profit cessna s segment profit increased million in  compared with  primarily due to the impact of higher volume of million  pricing in excess of inflation of million and favorable warranty performance of million  partially offset by increased engineering and product development expense of million  which includes costs related to the development of new citation models  cj and columbus  inventory writedowns of million  largely related to used aircraft  and increased overhead costs of million 
favorable warranty performance is primarily related to lower estimated warranty costs for aircraft sold in segment profit also includes other favorable warranty performance of million in both and in  cessna s segment profit increased million  compared with  primarily due to improved pricing of million  along with the million impact of higher volume and favorable warranty performance of million  partially offset by inflation of million and increased engineering and product development expense of million 
favorable warranty performance included the million impact of lower estimated warranty costs for aircraft sold in related to initial model launches as discussed below  partially offset by a lower benefit of million from other favorable warranty performance a million benefit in  compared with million in 
during initial model launches  cessna typically incurs higher warranty related costs until the production process matures  at which point warranty costs generally moderate 
for the sovereign and cj models  production lines had reached this maturity level based on historical production and warranty patterns  resulting in lower estimated warranty costs than earlier production aircraft 
accordingly  cessna has had favorable warranty performance in the past three years primarily due to the lower point of sale warranty costs for sovereign and cj aircraft sold 
bell dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin backlog bell revenues bell s revenues increased million in  compared with  primarily due to higher volume of million  higher pricing of million and revenues from newly acquired businesses of million 
the increase in volume relates primarily to higher v volume of million largely due to delivery of aircraft in  compared with in  higher h volume of million principally due to delivery of aircraft in  compared with in  and an increase in spares and service sales volume of million 
these volume increases were partially offset by lower commercial helicopter volume of million and lower arh program revenues of million as a result of the program s termination in october backlog at bell increased billion in  largely due to funding under the v multi year contract approved in march bell s revenues increased million in  compared with  primarily due to higher volume and mix of million and higher pricing of million 
the increase in volume relates primarily to an increase in h program revenues of million  principally due to delivery of the first production units  an increase in v program revenues of million  primarily due to higher spares revenues  and higher commercial helicopter deliveries of million 
these increases were partially offset by million in lower spares and service sales for aircraft other than the v and million in lower huey ii kit deliveries 
bell segment profit bell s segment profit increased million in  compared with  primarily due to favorable cost performance of million  higher pricing in excess of inflation of million and million in increased royalty revenues  primarily related to the model a cost performance includes improved performance for the h lrip program of million  primarily resulting from a million net charge recorded in the fourth quarter of and million in favorability in  as discussed in more detail below  million in lower net charges for the arh program  as discussed in more detail below  million in costs incurred in related to our exit of certain commercial models  million in commercial aircraft margins  primarily due to improved production efficiencies for the and models  and million for the v program  primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies 
favorable cost performance in was partially offset by million in increased selling and administrative expenses due to higher project related consulting expenses and million in increased research and development expense 
bell s segment profit increased million in  compared with  primarily due to higher pricing of million and lower engineering  research and development expense of million  partially offset by inflation of million and the net impact of an unfavorable product mix of million 
cost performance had only a moderate impact on profit but was impacted by the following significant items an increase in arh program charges from million in to million in  which are discussed in more detail below  lower h lrip program charges of million  which are discussed in more detail below  million in lower v profitability  largely due to a million impact from lower margin units  which have been unfavorably impacted by higher overhead costs associated with increasing production capacity  and a million award fee recognized in  and vendor termination costs of million as a result of streamlining our legacy commercial product lines  which were partially offset by million in lower overhead expense in the commercial business 
arh program termination on october   we received notification from the us department of defense that it would not certify the continuation of the arh program to congress under the nunn mccurdy act  resulting in the termination of the program for the convenience of the government 
the arh program included a development phase  covered by the sdd contract  and a production phase 
we are in the process of establishing the termination costs for the sdd contract  which we believe will be fully recoverable from the us government 
prior to termination of the program  we obtained inventory and incurred vendor obligations for long lead time materials related to the anticipated lrip contracts to maintain the program schedule based on our belief that the lrip contracts would be awarded 
we have since terminated these vendor contracts and have initiated negotiations to settle our termination obligations  which we estimate may cost up to approximately million 
we continue to evaluate the utility of the related inventory to other bell programs  customers  or vendors 
this review and the related discussions with vendors are ongoing 
we estimate that our potential loss resulting from our lrip related vendor obligations will be between approximately million and million 
at january   our reserves related to this program totaled million 
we intend to provide a termination proposal to the us government to request reimbursement of costs expended in support of the lrip program 
in  we incurred net charges of million related to this program 
in the first quarter of  we received correspondence from the us government that created uncertainty about whether it would proceed into the production phase of the arh program 
accordingly  we provided for losses of million in supplier obligations for long lead component production incurred at our own risk to support anticipated arh lrip contract awards to maintain the program schedule 
in the second quarter of  the us army agreed to re plan the arh program  and we reached a non binding memorandum of understanding related to aircraft specifications  pricing methodology and delivery schedules for initial lrip aircraft 
we also agreed to conduct additional sdd activities on a funded basis 
based on the plan at that time and our related estimates of aircraft production costs  including costs related to risks associated with achieving learning curve and schedule assumptions  we expected to lose approximately million on the production of the proposed initial lrip aircraft 
accordingly  an additional charge of million was taken for estimated lrip contract losses 
in the third quarter of  we reached an agreement with our customer under which we recovered million of sdd launch related costs previously written off  and  in december  we agreed to expand the scope of the development contract efforts on a funded basis 
based on the status of our negotiations with the us government and our contractual commitments with our vendors related to materials for the anticipated production units at that time  we revised our best estimate of the expected loss to million  resulting in a million reduction of previously established reserves 
in  we expensed million in unreimbursed costs we incurred in the development phase of the program as costs exceeded the original contract amount for this program 
h program segment profit includes charges related to the h program of million in and million in in  this program was still in the development phase while we were concurrently working on the initial production aircraft under firm fixed price lrip contracts with the us government 
in  we recorded million in charges based on our estimate that the costs to complete these lrip contracts would exceed contractual reimbursement due to higher estimated incremental costs for resources added to meet the contractual schedule requirements  higher anticipated efforts in final assembly  delayed acceptance of the initial aircraft by the us government due to changes in the development and engineering requirements identified in the final stages of assembly and acceptance testing  rework of in process units and resulting inefficiencies  and a reduction in previously anticipated learning curve improvements 
during  we completed delivery of all the lot aircraft as well as the first lot aircraft 
our manufacturing performance during the year was substantially consistent with our expectations  however  we anticipated a cost increase  primarily due to anticipated delays in receiving cabins from a supplier 
additionally  during the fourth quarter  we committed to higher pricing levels on an anticipated lot contract that we estimated would likely result in a loss once contract negotiations were finalized  primarily due to higher cabin supplier costs 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a net charge of million to reflect the higher cost estimates for existing contract completion resulting from supplier delays  as well as the estimated loss resulting from our price commitment on the lot contract 
during  our production efficiencies improved  resulting in million of favorable cost performance 
we delivered all remaining lot aircraft during the year and expect to deliver the final lot aircraft in february we also completed contract negotiations with the us government on lot  consistent with our prior expectations

finance dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit on december   our board of directors approved a plan to exit all of the commercial finance business of the finance segment  other than that portion of the business supporting customer purchases of textron manufactured products 
we made the decision to exit this business due to continued weakness in the economy and to address our long term liquidity position in light of continuing disruption and instability in the capital markets 
in total  these actions will impact approximately billion of the finance segment s billion managed receivable portfolio 
the exit plan will be effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales and is expected to be substantially complete over the next two to four years 
the finance group also announced a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of primarily related to headcount reductions and asset impairments resulting from the exit plan 
see special charges section on page regarding charges taken as a result of the exit plan  which are not reflected in segment profit 
finance revenues revenues in the finance segment decreased million in  compared with  primarily due to the following a million impact from lower market interest rates  million in lower securitization gains  net of impairments  and a lower gain on the sale of a leveraged lease investment of million 
these decreases were partially offset by the million benefit from variable rate receivable interest rate floors and a million impact from higher average finance receivables of million 
revenues in the finance segment increased million in  compared with our revenue growth was primarily attributed to the following factors higher average finance receivables of million  primarily due to growth in the aviation and resort finance businesses  which resulted in additional revenues of million  a million gain on the sale of a leveraged lease investment  and a million increase in securitization income  primarily related to a million increase in the level of receivables sold into the distribution finance revolving securitization 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in portfolio yields related to competitive pricing pressures  million in lower leveraged lease earnings due to an unfavorable cumulative earnings adjustment attributable to the recognition of residual value impairments  and an million reduction in leveraged lease earnings from the adoption of fsp no

we increased the allowance for loan losses significantly during in response to weakening general market conditions  declining collateral values and the lack of liquidity available to our borrowers and their customers 
we also increased our estimate of credit losses as a result of our decision to exit portions of the finance businesses in the fourth quarter  which we believe will negatively impact credit losses over the duration of our portfolio 
the increases in provision for loan losses were primarily a result of an million increase in defaults in the marine and recreational vehicles distribution finance portfolios  a million increase for the resort finance portfolio  a million reserve established for one account in the golf finance portfolio and a million reserve for one account in the asset based lending portfolio 
borrowing costs increased relative to the target federal funds rate as credit market volatility significantly impacted the historical relationships between market indices 
the increase was primarily driven by an increase in the spread between the london interbank offered rate libor and the target federal funds rate and from increased borrowing spreads on issuances of commercial paper in comparison with these increases were partially offset by increased receivable pricing as a result of variable rate receivables with interest rate floors 
segment profit in the finance segment increased million in  compared with  primarily due to a million increase in net interest margin  partially offset by an million increase in selling and administrative expenses  largely attributable to finance receivable portfolio growth and a million increase in provision for loan losses  reflecting an increase in nonperforming assets and net charge offs in the distribution finance portfolio 
net interest margin increased due to a number of factors  including the following an increase of million in securitization and other fee income as described above  and an increase of million related to growth in average finance receivables  partially offset by a million decrease in portfolio yields related to competitive pricing pressures  lower leveraged lease earnings of million due to an unfavorable cumulative earnings adjustment attributable to the recognition of residual value impairments  higher borrowing costs of million relative to the federal funds rate  a reduction in leveraged lease earnings of million from the adoption of a new accounting standard  and lower leveraged lease earnings of million due to a gain in on the sale of an option related to a leveraged lease asset

this plan is also likely to result in a slower rate of liquidation for nonperforming assets 
the increase in nonperforming assets is primarily attributable to million in the golf mortgage portfolio  with one golf mortgage account financing golf courses representing of this amount  and million in the resort portfolio  largely due to one resort account financing eight resorts and the associated timeshare notes receivable  which represented of the balance 
in addition  nonperforming assets and net charge offs increased substantially in the distribution finance portfolio reflecting continued weakening us economic conditions

liquidity and capital resources borrowing group presentation our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups 
the manufacturing group consists of textron inc consolidated with all of its majority owned subsidiaries that operate in the cessna  bell  textron systems and industrial segments  except for textron financial corporation 
the finance group consists of textron financial corporation consolidated with its subsidiaries 
we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group 
our manufacturing group operations include the development  production and delivery of tangible goods and services  while our finance group provides financial services 
due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group s activities  investors  rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group s performance 
to support those evaluations  we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 
recent developments historically  the principal source of liquidity for the manufacturing group has been operating cash flows  and we have had additional short term liquidity available to us through the commercial paper market  while for our long term capital needs  we have been able to access the public capital markets 
our finance group has historically funded its operations through commercial paper borrowings  issuances of medium term notes and other term debt securities  and syndication and securitization of receivables 
due to unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption in the credit markets beginning in the second half of  we experienced difficulty in accessing the commercial paper markets at favorable rates and terms 
on several days in early  we were unable to place sufficient amounts of commercial paper to meet our finance group s needs  resulting in our finance group borrowing on its bank line of credit 
the adverse impact that the credit market deterioration has had on us has been exacerbated by the recent downgrades of our credit ratings  which have adversely impacted our ability to access the term debt market 
given the current economic environment and the risks associated with the capital markets in general  including the current unavailability to us of public unsecured term debt and difficulty in accessing sufficient commercial paper on a daily basis  on february   we drew down on the balance of the billion committed bank credit lines available to textron and textron financial corporation 
after repayment of all commercial paper outstanding  this provides us with an aggregate amount of added cash liquidity of approximately billion 
together with the proceeds of planned liquidations and cash flow from our manufacturing group  we expect that this amount will be more than sufficient to repay the finance group s maturing term debt during early in the fourth quarter of  in order to reduce our reliance on short term funding  our board of directors approved the recommendation of management to downsize the finance segment 
the plan approved at that time entailed exiting the finance group s asset based lending and structured capital businesses  as well as several additional product lines  and limiting new originations in the distribution finance  golf finance and resort finance businesses 
as conditions continued to worsen  on december   our board of directors approved a plan to exit all of the commercial finance business of the finance segment  other than that portion of the business supporting customer purchases of textron manufactured products 
we made the decision to exit this business due to continued weakness in the economy and in order to address our long term liquidity position in light of continuing disruption and instability in the capital markets 
in total  the exit plan will impact approximately billion of the finance segment s billion managed receivable portfolio as of the end of the exit plan will be effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales and is expected to be substantially complete over the next two to four years 
under this exit plan  we expect to liquidate at least billion of managed finance receivables  net of originations  in  of which approximately billion will be used to pay down off balance sheet securitized debt 
the remainder of the planned liquidations will be utilized to repay a portion of the term debt issued by the finance group that is maturing in in the fourth quarter of  we approved a restructuring plan to reduce costs and improve productivity across the company 
the restructuring program  along with other volume related reductions in workforce during the fourth quarter of and in january  eliminates approximately  positions worldwide  representing approximately of our global workforce 
we expect the economic uncertainty and capital market turbulence to continue into in order to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to repay our maturing debt obligations during the first quarter of and beyond  our focus will be the maximization of cash flow through the following initiatives liquidation of finance receivables  including selected sales of finance receivables held for sale by our finance group  realignment of production in our commercial manufacturing businesses to match lower expected demand  cost reduction activities  including reducing our workforce  freezing salaries  curtailing most discretionary spending  including some reductions in product development  and reducing most areas of discretionary capital spending  and reduction of working capital with a focus on inventory management 
in  our board of directors declared quarterly dividends of per common share 
on february   we announced that our board of directors has voted to reduce our quarterly dividend to per share for the first quarter of this decision is intended to increase our liquidity in the long term interest of our shareholders 
the decision to pay a dividend is reviewed quarterly and requires declaration by our board of directors 
in addition  we are continuing to explore other potential avenues of liquidity  including funding sources in the capital markets and are actively pursuing new financing structures for the finance group  which would be secured directly by its finance receivable portfolio  as well as extensions of existing securitization vehicles 
in december  the finance group extended the revolving term of its aviation finance securitization by one year  which is estimated to provide additional liquidity of approximately million during as the current portfolio securing this funding source matures and is replaced with additional finance receivables 
depending on the success of the above cash flow initiatives and changes in external factors affecting the marketability and value of our assets  we may consider the sale of additional assets in the finance business or the sale of certain manufacturing businesses 
we believe that with the successful execution of the finance group s exit plan  combined with other liquidity actions discussed above and the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations  we will be able to raise cash sufficient to meet our future liquidity needs 
bank facilities and other sources of capital our aggregate billion in committed bank lines of credit have historically been in support of commercial paper and letters of credit issuances only 
there were no borrowings outstanding related to the manufacturing group s billion facility or the finance group s billion facility at the end of or in february  due to the unavailability of term debt and difficulty in accessing sufficient commercial paper on a daily basis  we drew the available balance from these credit facilities 
amounts borrowed under the credit facilities will not be due until april a portion of the proceeds will be used to repay all of our outstanding commercial paper as it comes due 
the debt net of cash to capital ratio for our manufacturing group was at january   compared with at december   and the gross debt to capital ratio at january  was  compared with at december  the manufacturing group maintains an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows it to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities  and the finance group maintains an effective shelf registration statement that allows it to issue an unlimited amount of public debt securities 
in the first half of  the finance group issued million of term debt under its registration statement 
contractual obligations finance group due to the nature of finance companies  we believe that it is meaningful to include contractual cash receipts that we expect to receive in the future 
the finance group generally borrows funds at various contractual maturities to match the maturities of its finance receivables 
the following table summarizes the finance group s liquidity position  including all managed finance receivables and both on and off balance sheet funding sources as of january   for the specified periods payments receipts due by period less than more than in millions year years years years years years total payments due multi year credit facilities  loan from textron and commercial paper other short term debt term debt securitized on balance sheet debt subordinated debt securitized off balance sheet debt loan commitments operating lease rental payments total payments due cash and contractual receipts finance receivable held for investment finance receivable held for sale securitized off balance sheet finance receivables operating lease rental receipts total contractual receipts cash total cash and contractual receipts net cash and contractual receipts payments cumulative net cash and contractual receipts payments contractual receipts and payments exclude finance charges from receivables  debt interest payments and other items 
commercial paper outstanding and the textron intercompany loan are reflected as being repaid in connection with the maturity of the finance group s billion committed multi year credit facility in actual commercial paper issuances generally are outstanding for less than days  however  these issuances were replaced by a full drawdown on the multi year credit facility in february securitized on balance sheet and securitized off balance sheet debt payments are based on the contractual receipts of the underlying receivables  which are remitted into the securitization structure when and as they are received 
these payments do not represent contractual obligations of the finance group  and we do not provide legal recourse to investors that purchase interests in the securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained subordinate interests 
finance receivable receipts are based on contractual cash flows only and do not reflect any reserves for uncollectible amounts 
these receipts could differ due to prepayments  charge offs and other factors  including the inability of borrowers to repay the balance of the loan at the contractual maturity date 
finance receivable receipts on the held for sale portfolio exclude the potential negative impact from selling the portfolio at the estimated fair value  which reflects a million mark to market adjustment  net of the existing allowance for loan losses of million  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this liquidity profile  combined with the excess cash generated by the drawdown of our credit facilities  is an indicator of the finance group s ability to repay outstanding funding obligations  assuming contractual collection of all finance receivables  absent access to new sources of liquidity or origination of additional finance receivables 
in addition  at january   our finance group had million in other liabilities  primarily including accounts payable and accrued expenses  that are payable within the next months 
at january   the finance group had billion of unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under revolving lines of credit  compared to billion at december  these loan commitments generally have an original duration of less than three years  and funding under these facilities is dependent on the availability of eligible collateral and compliance with customary financial covenants 
since many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire unused  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we also have ongoing customer relationships  including manufacturers and dealers in the distribution finance division  which do not contractually obligate us to provide funding  however  we may choose to fund certain of these relationships to facilitate an orderly liquidation and mitigate credit losses 
neither of these potential fundings is included as contractual obligations in the table above 
manufacturing group the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations  as defined by reporting regulations  of our manufacturing group as of january   as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied payments due by period less than more than in millions year years years years years years total liabilities reflected in balance sheet commercial paper long term debt capital lease obligations pension benefits for unfunded plans postretirement benefits other than pensions other long term liabilities liabilities not reflected in balance sheet operating leases purchase obligations total manufacturing group commercial paper outstanding at january  is reflected as being repaid in connection with the maturity of our billion committed multi year credit facility in actual commercial paper issuances generally are outstanding for less than days  however  these issuances were replaced by a full draw down on the multi year credit facility in february amounts exclude interest payments 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors  including mortality assumptions  expected retirement age  rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates  which are subject to change in future years 
our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually  consistent with applicable laws and regulations  however  future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table 
we expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans in the range of approximately million to million in based on our current assumptions  which may change with changes in market conditions  our current annual contribution for each of the years from through is estimated to be approximately million under the plan provisions in place at this time 
other long term liabilities included in the table consist primarily of undiscounted amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of january   representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs 
payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management s assumptions of expected retirement age  mortality  stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals 
the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience 
other long term liabilities  such as deferred taxes and unrecognized tax benefits  have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 
operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases 
purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which we are committed to purchase goods and services as of january  the ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts  the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the us government under normal termination clauses 
credit ratings credit ratings are a critical component of our ability to access the public term debt and commercial paper markets and also impact the cost of those borrowings 
factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance  the economic environment  conditions in the industries in which we operate  our financial position and changes in our business strategy 
since high quality credit ratings provide us with access to a broad base of global investors at an attractive cost  we target a long term a rating from the independent debt rating agencies 
while historically we have been able to achieve this target rating  in recent months  the long term ratings for both borrowing groups were downgraded several times by all of the debt rating agencies 
the credit ratings and outlooks of the debt rating agencies at february  are as follows fitch ratings moody s standard poor s long term ratings manufacturing bbb baa bbb finance bbb baa bbb short term ratings manufacturing f p a finance f p a outlook negative watch negative watch negative the major rating agencies regularly evaluate both borrowing groups  and their ratings of our long term debt are based on a number of factors  including our financial strength  and factors outside our control  such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 
our long term credit ratings have been downgraded several times in recent months  and fitch ratings downgraded our short term credit rating on february  in connection with these rating actions  the rating agencies have cited concerns about the finance group  including execution risks associated with our current plan to exit the non captive finance businesses and the need for textron inc to make capital contributions to textron financial corporation  as well as lower than expected business and financial outlook for  the increase in outstanding debt resulting from the drawdown on our credit facilities  weak economic conditions and continued liquidity and funding constraints 
failure to maintain investment grade credit ratings that are acceptable to investors would prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets  and may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain other financing  as well as our access to the capital markets 
manufacturing group cash flows the cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group are summarized below in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities under a support agreement between textron financial corporation and textron inc  textron inc 
is required to maintain a controlling interest in textron financial corporation 
the agreement also requires textron inc to ensure that textron financial corporation maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than and consolidated shareholder s equity of no less than million 
due to a goodwill impairment charge of million at textron financial corporation  along with other charges resulting from the exit plan discussed above  on december   textron inc made a cash payment of million to textron financial corporation  which was reflected as a capital contribution  to maintain compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio required by the support agreement and to maintain the leverage ratio required by its credit facility 
due to the nature of this contribution  we classified this contribution within cash flows used by operating activities for the manufacturing group resulting in the significant decline in cash provided by operating activities 
capital contributions to support finance group growth are classified as cash flows from financing activities 
the finance group s net income loss is excluded from the manufacturing group s cash flows  while dividends from the finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment 
excluding the capital contribution to the finance group  cash provided by operating activities totaled billion  reflecting consistent cash flow from the manufacturing group  even with continued investment in our working capital 
changes in our working capital components resulted in a million and million use of cash in and  respectively  and a million source of cash in a significant use of operating cash is related to increased production levels during the year and inventory build up at bell and cessna 
cash used for inventories totaled million  million and million  and  respectively 
partially offsetting the use of cash for inventories were customer deposits within accrued liabilities  which provided a significant source of operating cash 
customer deposits increased million  million and million in  and  respectively 
investing cash flows in were largely driven by capital expenditures of million in  million in and million in for  we plan to reduce our capital spending to about million  consistent with our reduced capacity requirements 
in and  we paid million and billion  largely related to the aai acquisition  in  we paid million  primarily related to the acquisition of overwatch systems 
in  financing activities include million in commercial paper borrowings of which a portion was used to make a cash payment for a capital contribution and for a loan to the finance group 
as we experienced limited ability to obtain financing at favorable rates in the second half of  we borrowed million against the cash surrender value of our corporate owned officers life insurance policies in these cash inflows from financing activities were offset by share repurchases of million  the maturity of two bonds requiring payments of million  dividends paid to shareholders of million and net lending to the finance group of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the manufacturing group utilized its commercial paper borrowings to lend cash to the finance group 
a portion of these inter group borrowings were repaid in the fourth quarter  primarily with funds from the million capital contribution discussed above 
at january   the finance group owed the manufacturing group million related to these borrowings 
in  and  we repurchased approximately million  million and million shares of common stock  respectively  under board authorized share repurchase programs 
in september  we suspended all share repurchase activity 
we used million less cash for financing activities in  compared with the decrease is due principally to the issuance of million in year notes in  the paydown of million of short term debt in and a million decrease in in purchases of our common stock from our annual dividend increased to in from in dividend payments to shareholders totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the timing of our quarterly dividend payments resulted in four payments in  three payments in and five payments in finance group cash flows the cash flows from continuing operations for the finance group are summarized below in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for both and was primarily due to the timing of payments of income taxes and accrued interest and other liabilities 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased during  primarily due to a million decrease in finance receivable originations  net of collections  mostly the result of the decision to exit portions of the finance business resulting in lower originations  partially offset by lower proceeds from receivable sales  including securitizations of million and the purchase of notes receivable issued by securitization trusts of million 
cash used for investing activities decreased in  compared with  largely due to a million decrease in finance receivable originations  net of collections  a million increase in proceeds from receivable sales  including securitizations  and the million impact in of cash used for an acquisition 
proceeds from receivable sales increased primarily due to the sale of million of receivables into the distribution finance revolving securitization in less cash was provided by financing activities in  primarily due to lower proceeds from borrowings related to the reduction in managed receivable growth and higher principal payments  largely offset by the million capital contribution received from the manufacturing group in under its support agreement the decrease in financing cash inflows in primarily reflects a reduction in borrowings due to lower managed receivable growth in comparison with in addition  during  we used the proceeds from receivable sales  including securitizations to fund asset growth  instead of additional borrowings 
consolidated cash flows the consolidated cash flows from continuing operations  after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups  are summarized below in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities consolidated cash provided by operating activities decreased  primarily due to investment in working capital as discussed in more detail within the manufacturing group cash flows section herein 
cash used for investing activities decreased due to the billion in cash used for acquisitions in  primarily related to aai 
cash used for investing activities decreased in  compared with  largely due to a million decrease in finance receivable originations  net of collections excluding million from captive financing activities and a million increase in proceeds from receivable sales and securitizations collections excluding million from captive financing activities 
these decreases were partially offset by million in higher cash outflows for acquisitions 
in  we acquired four businesses  including aai  for a total outflow of billion  while in  we acquired three businesses for million  including overwatch systems and electrolux financial corporation 
we received less cash from financing activities in  primarily due to million in lower proceeds from borrowings  net of principal payments 
we also used million more for share repurchases and million more for dividend payments to shareholders  which were partially offset by million in proceeds we received from borrowings against the cash surrender value of corporate owned officers life insurance policies in we received less cash from financing activities in  primarily due to a reduction in borrowings  largely a result of lower managed receivable growth in comparison with in addition  during  we used the proceeds from the sale of receivables  including securitizations to fund asset growth  instead of additional borrowings 
the decrease in cash borrowed by the finance group in from was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of million in year notes by the manufacturing group in  a million decrease in the purchases of our common stock and million in lower dividend payments due to timing 
captive financing and other intercompany transactions the finance group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our manufacturing group  otherwise known as captive financing 
in the consolidated statements of cash flows  cash received from customers or from securitizations is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties 
however  in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups  cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group 
for example  when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group  the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group s statement of cash flows 
meanwhile  in the manufacturing group s statement of cash flows  the cash received from the finance group on the customer s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow 
although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups  there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing 
these captive financing activities  along with all significant intercompany transactions  are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 
reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below in millions reclassifications from investing activities finance receivable originations for manufacturing group inventory sales cash received from customers  sale of receivables and securitizations other total reclassifications from investing activities reclassifications from financing activities capital contribution paid by manufacturing group to finance group dividends received by manufacturing group from finance group total reclassifications from financing activities total reclassifications and adjustments to cash flow from operating activities consolidated discontinued operations cash flows the cash flows from discontinued operations are summarized below in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities in the fourth quarter of  we received net cash proceeds from the sale of the fluid power business of approximately million  which is recorded in investing activities 
after taxes and other deal related expenses are paid  we expect total net after tax proceeds for the sale to be approximately million 
this excludes any cash proceeds related to the final payment to be determined based on the fluid power operating results 
in  cash flows from investing activities are primarily related to the realization of cash tax benefits from the fastening systems business 
in  cash inflows from investing activities include net cash proceeds of million for the sale of the fastening systems business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details concerning these dispositions 
off balance sheet arrangements performance guarantee in  through our bell helicopter business  we formed agustawestlandbell llc awb llc with agustawestland north america inc awna 
this venture was created for the joint design  development  manufacture  sale  customer training and product support of the vh helicopter  and certain variations and derivatives thereof  to be offered and sold to departments or agencies of the us government 
in march  awb llc received a billion cost reimbursement type subcontract from lockheed martin for the system development and demonstration phase of the us marine corps helicopter squadron program  which was increased to billion in december we guaranteed to lockheed martin the due and prompt performance by awb llc of all its obligations under this subcontract  provided that our liability under the guaranty shall not exceed of awb llc s aggregate liability to lockheed martin under the subcontract 
agustawestland nv  awna s parent company  has guaranteed the remaining to lockheed martin 
we have entered into cross indemnification agreements with agustawestland nv in which each party indemnifies the other related to any payments required under these agreements that result from the indemnifying party s workshare under any subcontracts received 
awb llc s maximum obligation is of the total contract value  of million  for a maximum amount of our liability under the guarantee of million at january  through completion 
under the current phase of the contract  we do not believe that there is any performance risk with respect to the guarantee 
in late january  the pentagon declared a nunn mccurdy act breach for this program due to cost overruns  requiring recertification of the program 
we do not have enough information at this time to make a determination of whether the program will be recertified  however  if the program were to be terminated  we do not believe that the guarantee will be triggered as it relates solely to performance under the subcontract 
finance receivable sales and securitizations the finance group primarily sells finance receivables utilizing asset backed securitization structures 
as a result of these transactions  finance receivables are removed from the balance sheet  and the proceeds received are used to reduce recorded debt levels 
despite the reduction in the recorded balance sheet position  we generally retain a subordinated interest in the finance receivables sold through securitizations  which may affect operating results through periodic fair value adjustments 
we utilize off balance sheet financing arrangements to further diversify funding alternatives  and termination of these arrangements would reduce our short term funding alternatives  which could result in increased funding costs for our managed finance receivable portfolio 
while these arrangements do not contain provisions that require us to repurchase significant amounts of receivables previously sold  there are risks that could reduce the availability of these funding alternatives in the future 
potential barriers to the continued use of these off balance sheet arrangements include deterioration in finance receivable portfolio quality  downgrades in our debt credit ratings  and a reduction of new finance receivable originations in the businesses that utilize these funding arrangements 
we do not expect any of these factors to have a material impact on our liquidity or income from operations  and if we were required to consolidate these arrangements  it would have no impact on our existing debt covenants 
as of january   we have one significant off balance sheet financing arrangement 
the distribution finance revolving securitization trust is a master trust that purchases inventory finance receivables from our finance group and issues asset backed notes to investors 
these receivables typically have short durations  which results in significant collections of previously purchased receivables and significant additional purchases of replacement receivables from us on a monthly basis 
this arrangement has provided net proceeds of million in  million in and million  and net pre tax gains of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
proceeds from securitizations include amounts received related to the issuance of additional asset backed notes to investors and exclude amounts received related to the ongoing replenishment of the outstanding sold balance of these short duration receivables 
during  million of the outstanding notes issued by the distribution finance revolving securitization trust matured  and the trust issued variable funding notes in the amount of million maturing in september and million maturing in may 
we retained million of these notes 
both notes have an interest rate equal to the commercial paper costs of the conduit purchasers 
in addition  the trust holds billion of one month libor based variable rate notes with three year terms 
approximately million of these notes mature in april and million mature in march we retained million of these notes 
the amount of pre tax gains recorded upon the ongoing sale of receivables in this arrangement and the value of our subordinated interest are impacted by the pricing of the investor notes issued by the trust 
therefore  an increase in the pricing of investor notes issued upon the maturity of the existing notes could have a negative impact on the gains recognized by the finance group related to future sales of receivables 
critical accounting estimates to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below 
we believe these policies require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes other significant accounting policies 
allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment we evaluate our allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment based on a combination of factors 
for homogeneous loan pools  we examine current delinquencies  the characteristics of the existing accounts  historical loss experience  the value of the underlying collateral  general economic conditions and trends  and the potential impact of the lack of liquidity available to our borrowers and their customers as a result of our current decision to exit our non captive finance businesses 
we estimate losses will range from to of finance receivables held for investment depending on the specific homogeneous loan pool 
for larger balance commercial loans  we also consider borrower specific information  industry trends and estimated discounted cash flows 
provision for losses on finance receivables held for investment are charged to income  in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment at a level considered adequate to cover losses inherent in the owned finance receivable held for investment portfolio  based on management s evaluation and analysis of this portfolio 
while management believes that its consideration of the factors and assumptions referred to above results in an accurate evaluation of existing losses in the portfolio based on prior trends and experience  changes in the assumptions or trends within reasonable historical volatility may have a material impact on our allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment 
the allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment currently represents of total finance receivables held for investment 
during the last five years  net charge offs as a percentage of finance receivables held for investment have ranged from to 
finance receivables held for sale as a result of our exit plan  billion of our finance receivable portfolio is classified as held for sale and is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value  and the remaining billion of receivables in our finance receivable portfolio is classified as held for investment 
upon the initial reclassification of these receivables to held for sale  we estimated the fair value to be million less than the carrying value  net of the million allowance for loan losses attributable to these portfolios 
this net adjustment was recorded in the fourth quarter of finance receivables are classified as held for sale based on the determination that we no longer intend to hold the receivables for the foreseeable future or until maturity or there is no longer the ability to hold to maturity 
our decision to classify certain finance receivables as held for sale is based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  contractual duration  type of collateral  credit strength of the borrowers  the existence of continued contractual commitments  the perceived marketability of the receivables and our ability to hold the receivables to maturity 
on an ongoing basis  these factors  combined with our overall liquidation strategy  determine which finance receivables we have the positive intent to hold for the foreseeable future and which receivables we will hold for sale 
our current strategy is based on an evaluation of both our performance and liquidity position and changes in external factors affecting the value and or the marketability of our finance receivables 
a change in this strategy could result in a change in the classification of our finance receivables 
if we subsequently determine that finance receivables classified as held for sale will not be sold  the finance receivables will be reclassified to held for investment at the lower of cost or fair value at that time 
conversely  if we determine that there are other finance receivables that we subsequently determine we no longer intend or have the ability to hold to maturity  these receivables would be designated as held for sale and a valuation allowance would be established at that time  if necessary 
at january   if we had classified additional finance receivables as held for sale  a valuation allowance would likely have been required at that time based on the fair value estimates we completed for our footnote disclosure requirements 
see page in note  fair values of assets and liabilities  to the consolidated financial statements for a table where we have included the carrying value and fair value for the assets and liabilities that are currently not recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 
finance receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
at the time of transfer to the held for sale classification  we establish a valuation allowance for any shortfall between the carrying value  net of all deferred fees and costs  and fair value 
upon the initial classification to held for sale  any shortfall is recorded as a charge within special charges 
in addition  any allowance for loan losses previously allocated to these receivables is reclassified to the valuation allowance account which is netted with finance receivables held for sale on the balance sheet 
after the valuation allowance is initially established  it is adjusted quarterly for any changes in the fair value of the receivables below the original carrying value  with subsequent adjustments included in earnings within segment profit 
fair value changes can occur based on market interest rates  market liquidity and changes in the credit quality of the borrower and value of underlying loan collateral 
there are no active  quoted market prices for our finance receivables 
the estimate of fair value was determined based on the use of discounted cash flow models to estimate the exit price we expect to receive in the principal market for each type of loan in an orderly transaction  which includes the sale of both pools of similar assets  and the sale of individual loans 
the models we used incorporate estimates of the rate of return  financing cost  capital structure and or discount rate expectations of prospective purchasers combined with estimated loan cash flows based on credit losses  payment rates and credit line utilization rates 
where available  the assumptions related to the expectations of prospective purchasers were compared to observable market inputs  including bids from prospective purchasers  and certain bond market indices for loans of similar perceived credit quality 
although we utilize and prioritize these market observable inputs in our discounted cash flow models  these inputs are rarely derived from markets with directly comparable loan structures  industries and collateral types 
therefore  all valuations of finance receivables held for sale involve significant management judgment  which can result in differences between our fair value estimates and those of other market participants 
long term contracts we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to long term contracts 
these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
we account for these long term contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and cost of a contract 
we then recognize that estimated profit over the contract term based on either the costs incurred under the cost to cost method  which typically is used for development effort or the units delivered under the units of delivery method  which is used for production effort  as appropriate under the circumstances 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and  in some cases  includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications 
due to the size  length of time and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total contract costs and revenue through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years 
we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements  complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs  manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones  including product deliveries 
our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals 
we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change 
adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different revenues and or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment  b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation  c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as declines in sales  earnings or cash flows  or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
see the special charges section on page for a discussion of the impairment of goodwill at the finance segment 
subsequent to this impairment  we completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of using the estimates from our long term strategic plans 
no adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill based on the analysis performed 
our market capitalization at january  was approximately billion  compared with approximately billion at december  this market capitalization is less than the sum of the fair values of our manufacturing reporting units calculated in connection with our annual impairment test 
we believe that the differences between the fair value estimates of our manufacturing reporting units and our market capitalization are primarily due to the market s view of risk in the finance segment 
as noted above  we have fully impaired goodwill at the finance segment and concerns over our liquidity 
we believe that our fair value estimates for our manufacturing reporting units are consistent with market participant assumptions 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions consistent with market participants 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions  and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions 
if different assumptions were used in these forecasts  the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different  potentially resulting in an impairment charge 
during the second half of  kautex was negatively impacted by the significant downturn in the automotive industry  which caused deterioration in its revenues and segment profit 
our annual evaluation of goodwill recoverability for kautex was extended to include our projections and outlook for the automotive industry as of the end of the fourth quarter  and we believe the carrying value of the reporting unit is recoverable at january  we anticipate volumes to continue to be lower through from through  for purposes of our goodwill analysis  we have assumed an average annual sales growth rate of with operating profit margins returning to recent historical levels by operating profit margin improvements are expected to result from significant restructuring activities  including realignment of excess capacity through personnel reductions  as well as from higher volumes 
a basis point reduction in the estimated operating profit margins during the to period  used in our discounted cash flow model  would reduce the estimated fair value of kautex by up to million and may result in the carrying value of the business exceeding its estimated fair value  potentially resulting an impairment charge 
at january   the goodwill allocated to kautex totaled million 
our operating plans and projections for our golf turfcare component anticipate operating margin improvements over the five year planning period resulting in high single digit margins and assume annual revenue growth of approximately 
a basis point decline in our operating margin assumptions would reduce the estimated fair value by up to approximately million and may result in the carrying value of the component exceeding its estimated fair value  potentially resulting in an impairment charge 
at january   the goodwill allocated to this component totaled approximately million 
retirement benefits we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally 
these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations  which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long term rates of return on plan assets  discount rates and healthcare cost projections 
we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increases 
we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense 
for  the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was  compared with in in and  the assumed rate of return for our qualified domestic plans  which represent approximately of our total pension assets  was and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in this long term rate of return would result in a million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date  reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
this rate should be in line with rates for high quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits  which fluctuate as long term interest rates change 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
in  the weighted average discount rate used in calculating pension expense was  compared with in for our qualified domestic plans  the assumed discount rate was in  compared with for a basis point decrease in this discount rate would result in a million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 
the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate  and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities 
the medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weighted average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits 
the medical rate of is assumed to decrease to by and then remain at that level 
the prescription drug rate of is assumed to decrease to by and then remain at that level 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a one percentage point change in the cost trend rate 
warranty liabilities we provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs  including parts and labor  for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years 
a significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses 
we also may incur costs related to product recalls 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold  historical costs per claim  contractual recoveries from vendors  and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  including production and warranty patterns for new models 
during our initial aircraft model launches  we typically incur higher warranty related costs until the production process matures  at which point warranty costs moderate 
we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary 
adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant 
should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience  we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 
securitized transactions securitized transactions involve the sale of finance receivables to qualified special purpose trusts 
we may retain an interest in the assets sold in the form of interest only securities  seller certificates  cash reserve accounts  and servicing rights and obligations 
at the time of sale  a gain or loss is recorded based on the difference between the proceeds received and the allocated carrying value of the finance receivables sold 
the allocated carrying value is determined based on the relative fair values of the finance receivables sold and the interests retained 
as such  the fair value estimate of the retained interests has a direct impact on the gain or loss recorded 
we estimate fair value based on the present value of future cash flows using management s best estimates of key assumptions credit losses  prepayment speeds  discount rates and forward interest rate yield curves commensurate with the risks involved 
we review the fair values of the retained interests quarterly using updated assumptions and compare such amounts with the carrying value 
when the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we determine whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
when we determine the value of the decline is other than temporary  we write down the securities to fair value with a corresponding charge to income 
when a change in fair value of the interest only securities is deemed temporary  we record a corresponding credit or charge to other comprehensive income for any unrealized gains or losses 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of key assumptions used to record initial gains related to the sale of finance receivables through securitizations and to measure the current fair value of the interest only securities 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse or settle 
based on the evaluation of available evidence  we recognize future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits 
we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in the valuation allowance  with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income loss  as appropriate 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in carryback years  the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
interest and penalties are accrued  where applicable 
we recognize net tax related interest and penalties in income tax expense 
if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations  new regulatory or judicial pronouncements  or other relevant events 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks our financial results are affected by changes in us and foreign interest rates 
as part of managing this risk  we enter into interest rate exchange agreements to convert certain floating rate debt to fixed rate debt and vice versa 
the overall objective of our interest rate risk management is to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixed rate debt 
we continually monitor our mix of floating and fixed rate debt and adjust the mix  as necessary  based on our evaluation of internal and external factors 
the difference between the rates our manufacturing group received and the rates it paid on interest rate exchange agreements did not significantly impact interest expense in  or our finance group limits its risk to changes in interest rates with its strategy of matching floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities 
this strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements 
at january   floating rate liabilities in excess of floating rate assets were billion  net of billion of interest rate exchange agreements  which effectively converted fixed rate debt to a floating rate equivalent 
classified within fixed rate assets are billion of floating rate loans with index rate floors that are  on average  basis points above the applicable index rate predominately the prime rate 
these assets will remain classified as fixed rate until the prime rate increases above the floor rates 
we have benefited from the interest rate floor arrangements in the recent low rate environment  however  in a rising rate environment  this benefit will dissipate until the prime rate exceeds the floor rates embedded in these agreements 
the net effect of interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt decreased interest expense for our finance group by million in and increased interest expense by million and million in and  respectively 
foreign exchange risks our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which products are manufactured and or sold 
for  the impact of foreign exchange rate changes from increased revenues by approximately million and decreased segment profit by approximately million 
for our manufacturing operations  we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset 
we primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes 
in managing our foreign currency transaction exposures  we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts 
these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts and foreign currency options was approximately billion at the end of and billion at the end of quantitative risk measures in the normal course of business  we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading 
to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments  we utilize a sensitivity analysis 
the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk  foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables  debt excluding lease obligations  interest rate exchange agreements  foreign currency exchange contracts and marketable security price forward contracts for our common stock 
we utilize forward contracts for our common stock to manage the expense related to our stock based compensation awards 
presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at year end 
we estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers 
this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a hypothetical change in the fair value of the financial instruments assuming a decrease in interest rates  a strengthening in exchange rates against the us dollar and a decrease in the quoted market price of our common stock
