operations we view each of our casino properties as an operating segment 
the venetian las vegas and the palazzo operating segments are managed as a single integrated resort and have been aggregated into our las vegas operating properties  considering their similar economic characteristics  types of customers  types of service and products  the regulatory business environment of the operations within each segment and the company s organizational and management reporting structure 
approximately and of gross revenue at our las vegas operating properties for the years ended december  and  respectively  was derived from room revenues  food and beverage services  and other non gaming sources  and and  respectively  was derived from gaming activities 
the percentage of non gaming revenue reflects the integrated resort s emphasis on the group convention and trade show business and the resulting high occupancy and room rates throughout the week  including during mid week periods 
our macao operating segments consist of sands macao  the venetian macao  four seasons macao and other ancillary operations that support these properties and will support our remaining cotai strip development projects 
approximately and of the gross revenue at the sands macao for the years ended december  and  respectively  was derived from gaming activities  with the remainder primarily derived from room revenues and food and beverage services

approximately of the gross revenue at the four seasons macao for the period ended december   was derived from gaming activities  with the remainder primarily derived from retail and other non gaming sources 
development projects as mentioned above  given current conditions in the capital markets and the global economy and their impact on our ongoing operations  we have chosen to suspend portions of our development projects and will focus our development efforts on those projects with the highest rates of expected return on invested capital 
should general economic conditions not improve  if we are unable to obtain sufficient funding such that completion of our suspended projects is not probable  or should management decide to abandon certain projects  all or a portion of our investment to date on our suspended projects could be lost and would result in an impairment charge 
in addition  we may be subject to penalties under the termination clauses in our construction contracts 
united states development projects we are in the process of constructing the sands bethlehem  a gaming  hotel  retail and dining complex located on the site of the historic bethlehem steel works in bethlehem  pennsylvania  which is approximately miles from midtown manhattan  new york 
we will continue construction of the casino component of the acre development  which will open with  slot machines with the ability to increase to  slot machines six months after the opening date and will include a variety of dining options  as well as the parking garage and surface parking 
construction activities on the remaining components  which include a room hotel  an approximate  square foot retail facility  a  square foot multipurpose event center and a variety of additional dining options  have been temporarily suspended and are intended to recommence when capital markets and general economic conditions improve

table of contents we had been constructing the st 
regis residences  which is situated between the palazzo and the venetian las vegas on the las vegas strip and was expected to feature approximately luxury residences 
we have suspended construction activities for the project due to reduced demand for las vegas strip condominiums and the overall decline in general economic conditions 
we intend to recommence construction when these conditions improve and expect that it will take approximately months from when construction recommences to complete the project 
macao development projects we have submitted plans to the macao government for our cotai strip developments  which represent five integrated resort developments  in addition to the venetian macao and the four seasons macao on an area of approximately acres which we refer to as parcels    and 
the developments were expected to include hotels  exhibition and conference facilities  casinos  showrooms  shopping malls  spas  restaurants  entertainment facilities and other amenities 
we had commenced construction or pre construction for these five parcels and planned to own and operate all of the casinos in these developments under our macao gaming subconcession 
we have suspended construction of phase i of parcels and  which includes the shangri la and traders tower and the first sheraton tower  along with the podium that encompasses the casino  associated public areas  portions of the shopping mall and approximately  square feet of meeting space  while the company pursues project level financing 
if and when financing has been obtained  we expect it will take approximately twelve months to complete construction of phase i 
construction of phase ii of the project  which includes the second sheraton tower and the st 
regis hotel and serviced luxury apartment hotel  has been suspended until conditions in the capital markets and general economic conditions improve 
we had commenced pre construction on parcels  and  and intend to commence construction after necessary government approvals are obtained  regional and global economic conditions improve  future demand warrants it and additional financing is obtained

hotel revenues are not material for the sands macao as its revenues are principally driven by casino customers who visit the casino on a daily basis 
the following are the key measurements we use to evaluate operating revenues casino revenue measurements for las vegas table games drop drop and slot handle handle are volume measurements 
win or hold percentage represents the percentage of drop or handle  respectively  that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue 
table games drop represents the sum of markers issued credit instruments less markers paid at the table  plus cash deposited in the table drop box 
slot handle is the gross amount wagered or coin placed into slot machines in aggregate for the period cited 
based upon our mix of table games  our table games produce a statistical average win percentage calculated before discounts as measured as a percentage of drop of to and slot machines produce a statistical average hold percentage calculated before slot club cash incentives as measured as a percentage of handle generally between and 
casino revenue measurements for macao macao table games are segregated into two groups  consistent with the macao market s convention rolling chip play all vip play and non rolling chip play mostly non vip players 
the volume measurement for rolling chip play is non negotiable gaming chips wagered 
the volume measurement for non rolling chip play is table games drop as previously described 
rolling chip volume and non rolling chip volume are not equivalent as rolling chip volume is a measure of amounts wagered versus dropped 
rolling chip volume is substantially higher than table games drop 
slot handle is the gross amount wagered or coins placed into slot machines in aggregate for the period cited 
we view rolling chip table games win as a percentage of rolling chip volume and non rolling chip table games win as a percentage of non rolling chip drop 
win or hold percentage represents the percentage of rolling chip volume and non rolling chip drop or handle  respectively  that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue 
based upon our mix of table games in macao  our rolling chip table games win percentage calculated 
table of contents before discounts and commissions as measured as a percentage of rolling chip volume is expected to be and our non rolling chip table games are expected to produce a statistical average win percentage as measured as a percentage of non rolling chip drop of to 
similar to las vegas  our macao slot machines produce a statistical average hold percentage as measured as a percentage of handle of generally between and 
actual win may vary from the statistical average 
generally  slot machine play is conducted on a cash basis 
credit based wagering for our las vegas properties was approximately of table games revenues for the year ended december  table games play at our macao properties are conducted primarily on a cash basis with only credit based wagering for the year ended december  hotel revenue measurements hotel occupancy rate  which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period  and average daily room rate  which is the average price of occupied rooms per day  are used as performance indicators 
revenue per available room represents a summary of hotel average daily room rates and occupancy 
because not all available rooms are occupied  average daily room rates are normally higher than revenue per available room 
reserved rooms where the guests do not show up for their stay and lose their deposit may be re sold to walk in guests 
these rooms are considered to be occupied twice for statistical purposes due to obtaining the original deposit and the walk in guest revenue 
in cases where a significant number of rooms are re sold  occupancy rates may be in excess of and revenue per available room may be higher than the average daily room rate

room revenues for the year ended december   increased million as compared to the year ended december   due primarily to a full year of operations of the venetian macao and the palazzo
