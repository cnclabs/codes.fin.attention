item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those we discuss under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
the results of operations for the year ended december  will not be comparable to the results of operations for the year ended december  due to the enerwise and pes acquisitions completed in the second half of the year ended december  includes results from the date of acquisitions to the end of the year 
the year ended december  includes a full year of operating results for the consolidated company  including the acquired entities 
overview we first introduced our vpc programs in growth and acceptance of our vpc programs have expanded the growth of our business as a whole as well as complementary acquisitions completed during the second half of  which strengthened our demand management offerings 
we reported total revenues of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  while our revenues have grown  we have incurred net losses since our inception and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  our net losses have been driven principally by general and administrative  marketing  operating and depreciation expenses related to capital expenditures for equipment required to support our vpc programs as well as noncash impairment charges on goodwill and certain intangible assets 
we plan to continue the expansion and development of our capacity programs to grow our revenues and customer base  which will include increased marketing and operating expenses 
as of december   our existing vpc contracts represented contracted capacity of megawatts and our base load capacity represented contracted capacity of megawatts 
the table below presents the activity in megawatts of contracted capacity from long term capacity contracts 
megawatts owned under long term capacity contracts as of december  new vpc megawatts awarded during the year ended december  nevada energy vpc contract pacific gas electric company vpc contract public service company of new mexico vpc contract expansion of vpc programs total new vpc megawatts awarded expiration of iso new england  inc vpc contracts consolidated edison base load capacity contracts acquired as of december  new vpc megawatts awarded during the year ended december  southern maryland electric cooperative vpc contract expansion of vpc programs total new vpc megawatts awarded new base load capacity program megawatts as of december  does not include megawatts of contracted capacity for vpc contracts that have not received final regulatory approval 
specifically  the table does not include megawatts of combined contracted capacity for the vpc contracts with arizona public service and southern california edison 
cumulatively  we have installed approximately megawatts of capacity as of december   excluding approximately megawatts installed as of december  under the iso new england  inc vpc contracts 
we intended to utilize a portion of these assets in a capacity contract we signed with the connecticut light and power company in march  however  the contract did not receive the required regulatory approval 
we therefore deployed a portion of the assets in the independent system operator forward capacity market auction for and we entered into vpc contracts with southern california edison in late and arizona public service in september for an additional megawatts of combined capacity 
on march   the california public utilities commission issued an order denying approval of our vpc contract with southern california edison 
we have signed an amendment with southern california edison and anticipate further commission review in the near future 
if these vpc contracts receive regulatory approval  we will invest additional amounts to build out these and other new programs as we are awarded vpc contracts in the future 
in the short term  our success operating such contracts would have a negative effect on earnings because of the consumer acquisition costs that we incur during the installation phase of the contract 
these increased costs may cause us to incur net losses in the foreseeable future 
december  december  contracted capacity installed capacity available capacity installed capacity generally refers to the number of devices installed multiplied by the historically highest demonstrated available capacity provided per device for the applicable service territory 
available capacity represents the amount of electric capacity that we have made available to our customers during each contract year based on the results of our measurement and verification process 
we have used the most recent measurement and verification results for contract year to present available capacity for each period presented 
available capacity is typically measured during the fourth quarter of each year 
reporting segments we report through three segments the utility products services segment  the residential business segment and the commercial industrial business segment 
the utility products services segment reports the sales of hardware  software and installation services to utilities that elect to own and operate such demand response networks for their own benefit 
our residential business segment reports the sale of electric capacity  through demand response or permanent base load reduction  to utilities on an outsourced basis under long term contracts 
the residential business segment accomplishes this by either developing  owning and managing a demand response network on behalf of the utility or completing baseline efficiency projects  such as installing lighting upgrades  for the utility 
the residential business segment also reports the sale of program management and marketing services on an outsourced basis 
the commercial industrial business segment reports the sale of energy infrastructure management  demand response and renewable energy services and technologies to and for commercial and industrial customers 
these offerings enable commercial and industrial consumers to reduce energy consumption and total costs  improve energy infrastructure reliability and make informed decisions on energy and renewable energy purchases and programs 
utility products services our utility products services segment offers a broad range of products from basic one way load control switches to smart thermostats to comprehensive two way data collection and control systems 
the most widely deployed products offered by our utility products services segment are our digital control unit  an intelligent  microprocessor driven solution for load management control  which is installed on large energy consuming devices and controls the cycling and operation of the device  and our superstat smart thermostat  an advanced  programmable thermostat solution with embedded communications to control air conditioning and heating loads 
our utility products services segment provides utilities program management services in which we design  build out and operate a load control program  with the utility retaining ownership of the underlying asset 
residential business our residential business segment primarily offers residential and small commercial turn key demand response programs or residential demand management through peak and base load reduction programs to electric utilities pursuant to which we provide capacity  on a pay for performance basis  through long term contracts 
under our vpc programs  we develop  operate and manage the entire load management system 
as of december   we had begun build out of five residential and small commercial vpc programs in our residential business segment 
in addition to vpc programs  with the acquisition of pes  our residential business segment  provides permanent base load reduction programs 
the residential business segment also provides utilities marketing services on an outsourced basis 
once we secure a vpc contract with a utility customer  our residential business segment incurs significant marketing costs to identify and enroll participants in our vpc programs 
these participant acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
once a participant enrolls in one of our vpc programs  we install a digital control unit or thermostat at the participant s location 
the cost of the installation and the hardware are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining term of the contract with the utility  which is shorter than the operating life of the equipment 
the participant acquisition costs typically result in lower operating margins and greater losses in the early years of a vpc contract 
our base load reduction contracts are similar to the vpc contracts in that we have to recruit and enroll participants into the program 
the participant acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
unlike certain vpc programs  we do not own the underlying asset 
commercial industrial business our commercial industrial business segment offers commercial and industrial demand management and energy management services 
the demand response services provide commercial and industrial customers with an ability to participate in demand response programs offered in their area by grid operators such as pjm interconnection llc 
the energy management services include the assessment of market opportunities in deregulated and unregulated markets and the performance of energy auditing and implementation strategies 
the energy management services may also include the upgrade and maintenance of power systems such as the implementation of power system distribution analysis  testing  maintenance  replacement or repair  engineering design and consulting  meter and sub meter operations  and data management and analysis 
payments from long term contracts payments from long term contracts represent our estimate of total payments that we expect to receive under long term agreements with our utility customers 
the information presented below with respect to payments from long term contracts includes payments related to our vpc contracts  base load contracts  and open market bidding programs 
as of december   we estimated that our total payments to be received through were approximately million 
we have excluded any estimated payments from our vpc contracts with southern california edison and arizona public services  which are awaiting final regulatory approval 
we have excluded potential megawatts under the expansion of our current vpc contracts for the portion of those megawatts subject to regulatory approval 
these estimates of payments from long term contracts are forward looking statements based on the contractual terms and conditions 
in management s view  such information was prepared on a reasonable basis  reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments  and  to management s knowledge and belief  presents the assumptions and considerations on which we base our belief that we can receive such payments 
however  this information should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results  and readers of this annual report should not place undue reliance on this information 
any differences among these assumptions  other factors and our actual experiences may result in actual payments in future periods significantly differing from management s current estimates of payments allowed under the long term contracts and our actual experiences may result in actual payments collected being significantly lower than current estimates 
see risk factors we may not receive the payments anticipated by our long term contracts and recognize revenue from our backlog  and comparisons of period to period estimates are not necessarily meaningful  may not be indicative of actual payments and should not be relied upon 
the information in this section is designed to summarize the financial terms of our long term contracts and is not intended to provide guidance on our future operating results  including revenue or profitability 
our estimated payments from long term contracts have been prepared by management based on the following assumptions vpc contracts our existing vpc contracts as of december  represented contracted capacity of megawatts  an increase of megawatts compared to contracted capacity of megawatts as of december  as of december   we had installed megawatts of capacity 
in calculating estimated payments of million from our vpc contracts as of december   we have assumed that we will complete the build out of our remaining megawatts by the end of  reaching the full megawatts of potential available capacity under our load management systems 
our expectations regarding the build out under our vpc contracts are based on our experience to date in building out the load management systems 
we have assumed that once our build out phase is complete we will operate our vpc contracts at their maximum contractual capacity for the remainder of the term 
for example  if one of our vpc contracts provides for megawatts of contracted capacity  we have assumed that upon full build out we will provide our utility customer with megawatts of available capacity for the remainder of the contract term 
the amount our utility customers pay to us at the end of each contract year may vary based upon the results of measurement and verification tests performed each contract year based on the electric capacity that we made available to the utility during the contract year 
the payments from vpc contracts reflect our most reasonable currently available estimates and judgments regarding the capacity that we believe we will provide our utility customer 
the amount of available capacity we are able to provide  and therefore the amount of payments we receive  is dependent upon the number of participants in our vpc programs 
for purposes of estimating our payments under long term contracts  we have assumed the rate of replacement of participant terminations under our vpc contracts will remain consistent with our historical average 
payments from long term contracts include million that we expect to recognize as revenue over the next months  which we include in backlog 
payments from long term contracts exclude million of payments  which we have already received but have been deferred in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
we expect to also recognize these payments as revenue over the course of the next months 
base load capacity contracts our existing energy efficiency contracts as of december  represent potential base load contracted capacity of megawatts 
in calculating the estimated million in payments from these contracts  we have assumed we will complete the build out of the remaining megawatts by the end of we have assumed that once our build out is completed  the permanent base load reduction will remain installed and will continue to provide the maximum contractual capacity for the remainder of the contract term 
our expectation regarding the build out under our energy efficiency contracts is based on the experience to date 
open market bidding programs as of december   we had megawatts bid into the capacity auction program with the pjm interconnection  llc 
we currently expect to receive approximately million in long term payments through the year in estimating the long term payments  we have assumed that we will have limited churn among our commercial and industrial end users that we have currently enrolled in the auctions 
other contracts million in payments expected to be received over the next six years under a contract with a utility customer to provide products and services 
this is based on estimated contractual minimum order volumes and current payments attributable to installation and other services applied over the term of the contract 
an estimated million in payments expected to be received over the next five years under contracts with two customers to provide hardware  software  and installation services 
an estimated million in purchase orders pursuant to multi year contracts that we expect will be renewed through based on amounts and timing of historical purchases 
million in payments expected to be received over the next three years from our energy and capacity management services 
million in payments expected to be received through related to our outsourced marketing program 
in addition to the foregoing assumptions  our estimated payments from long term contracts assume that we will be able to meet on a timely basis all of our obligations under these contracts and that our customers will not terminate the contracts for convenience or other reasons 
our annual net loss in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
we may continue to generate annual net losses in the future  including through the term of our long term contracts 
see risk factors we have incurred annual net losses since our inception  and we may continue to incur annual net losses in the future 
although we currently intend to release quarterly updates of future revisions that we may make to our estimated payments from long term contracts  we do not undertake any obligation to release the results of any future revisions that we may make to these estimated payments from long term contracts to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this annual report 
backlog our backlog represents our estimate of revenues from commitments  including purchase orders and long term contracts  that we expect to recognize over the course of the next months 
a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of actual revenues 
as of december   we had contractual backlog of million 
as of december   we had contractual backlog of million 
current outlook we currently expect our full year fiscal revenues will exceed million 
comverge s management and board of directors uses three metrics to measure the company s operational progress i megawatts owned under long term contracts  ii megawatts managed under open market programs  and iii estimated future revenues from long term contracts 
we believe these metrics are the most important to the growth and long term success of the company 
our targets for growth in these metrics are add a net megawatts of capacity under long term contracts  add a net megawatts in open market programs  add a net million increase in the amount of estimated future payments from long term contracts 
as of the date of this filing  we have megawatts under long term contract which will contribute to contracted future revenues of million 
of these amounts  megawatts of capacity under long term contracts representing an expected million in contracted future revenues  are still awaiting regulatory approval 
in the event we receive regulatory approval on these megawatts  and including new megawatts acquired in open market programs and a new turnkey contract awarded during the first quarter of  our total megawatts managed will be  megawatts 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue the following table summarizes our revenue for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percent change segment revenue utility products services residential business commercial industrial business total during the year ended december   we classified the results of operations for all vpc contracts in our residential business segment 
during the year ended december   we reclassified our commercial and industrial vpc contract into the newly formed commercial industrial business segment 
the results of operations for have been reclassified for the change 
utility products services revenue our utility products services segment had revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in revenue was due to a million increase in digital control unit revenue and a million increase in superstat revenue 
digital control unit and superstat shipments to external customers were approximately  units for the year ended december  compared to  units for the year ended december   an increase of 
residential business revenue our residential business segment had revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
we recognized million of revenue from our vpc contracts  million from our base load energy efficiency programs and million from our outsourced marketing and program management services during the year ended december  we recognized million of revenue from our vpc contracts  million from our base load energy efficiency programs and million from our outsourced marketing and program management services during the year ended december  we recognized million of revenue from our vpc contracts in the residential business segment for the year ended december  compared to million of revenue from vpc contracts for the year ended december   a million decrease 
during the year ended december   our vpc contract with iso new england  inc expired according to its terms  which previously provided million of revenue in the year ended december  in  the residential business segment partially offset the lost revenue from the iso new england  inc contract by continuing to expand build out in our remaining and new vpc programs 
our residential business segment s revenue for the year ended december  included million in revenue from our base load energy efficiency programs compared to million in revenue for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the base load energy efficiency contracts were acquired as part of the public energy solutions  or pes  acquisition in september the operating results were included in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the date of acquisition 
the remaining million increase in our residential business segment s revenue compared to the prior year is a result of our outsourced marketing and program management services 
specifically  as discussed above  a portion of assets from our now expired iso new england inc vpc contract has been deployed in the independent system operator forward capacity market for and we recognized million in revenue during the year ended december  from managing these megawatts 
we defer revenue and direct cost under our vpc contracts until such revenue can be made fixed and determinable through a measurement and verification test  generally in our fourth fiscal quarter 
for the fourth quarters ended december  and  we recognized vpc contract revenue of million and million  respectively 
because contract year consideration of million related to our vpc contracts was not fixed and determinable as of december   this amount will be recognized as revenue during similarly  contract year consideration of million was not fixed and determinable as of december  and was recognized as revenue in the first half of commercial industrial business revenue our commercial industrial business segment was essentially formed with our acquisition of enerwise global technologies  inc  or enerwise  in july during the year ended december  and  the commercial industrial business segment had revenue of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   revenue is comprised of million from demand response services and million from energy management services 
for the year ended december   revenue is comprised of million from demand response services and million from energy management services 
revenue from economic demand response programs was million in the year ended december  the current year economic program revenue was significantly less than revenue for the prior year 
in the prior year  economic demand response program revenue was million from the date we acquired enerwise on july  to december  the decrease in demand response service revenue is directly related to the pjm rule change effected in that reduced the price we receive under our economic or voluntary demand response programs for commercial and industrial consumers 
because such programs are voluntary  the lower price and operating rule changes in made it less compelling for our commercial and industrial consumers to participate 
the majority of managed megawatts are enrolled in economic demand response programs  which are weather dependent 
warmer temperatures generally result in higher electricity prices in the pjm service territory 
these higher prices tend to make it economically attractive for our commercial and industrial consumers to shed load which we then sell to pjm 
the rule changes to these programs in had the effect of reducing the spot market price by the average retail rate paid by the commercial and industrial customer  resulting in a lower price received by us  and ultimately the end consumer 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue for the commercial industrial business segment s capacity demand response programs 
in the prior year  capacity demand response program revenue was million from the date we acquired enerwise on july  to december  the million in revenue during was comprised of revenue for two capacity years one capacity year beginning june  and ending may  and one capacity year beginning june  and ending may  of the million in capacity revenue recognized for the year ended december   million related to the capacity year ending may  and the remaining million related to the capacity year beginning june  and ending may  during the capacity year ended may   we recognized revenue as monthly payments were received over the course of the full contract year 
following a clarification of the program rules by pjm  we revised the attribution period for revenue related to the capacity program 
based on this clarification  revenue is recognized when it becomes fixed and determinable at the end of the mandatory performance period 
for the capacity year ending may   we recognized revenue at the end of the september as we had completed the mandatory performance period during the months of june to september 
gross profit and gross margin the following table summarizes our gross profit and gross margin percentages for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  gross gross gross gross profit margin profit margin segment gross profit and margin utility products services residential business commercial industrial business total utility products services gross profit and gross margin gross profit for our utility products services segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
an increased gross profit resulted from the increase in revenue 
specifically  we shipped  more digital control units and superstats to external customers in as compared to residential business gross profit and gross margin gross profit for our residential business segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the gross margin for vpc contracts was in the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the gross margin of our vpc contracts varies due to the period in which we depreciate our vpc program capital equipment 
we depreciate our vpc program capital equipment over the remaining contract life  which is shorter than the economic life of such equipment 
as a result  the annual depreciation charge per new kilowatt of capacity installed will increase over the term of a vpc contract  while the revenue per kilowatt of capacity for any contract year will be determined by other factors that bear no relation to the depreciation 
we expect that our gross margin on vpc revenue in will be significantly less than the result because our largest vpc contract is expiring at the end of therefore  all capital deployed in under that one vpc contract will be fully expensed in resulting in a lower gross margin for that vpc contract and the residential business segment as a whole 
the related impact is expected to result in a decrease of approximately percentage points in gross margin for the residential business segment 
the residential business segment s gross profit for the year ended december  included million in gross profit from our base load energy efficiency programs compared to million in gross profit for the year ended december   an increase of million 
gross margin attributable to the base load energy efficiency contracts was approximately for both years ended december  and the remaining million increase in residential business segment s gross profit compared to the prior year is a result of our outsourced marketing and program management services 
the majority of the increase in gross profit was due to the megawatts registered in the and forward capacity market that were historically part of our iso new england  inc vpc contract 
commercial industrial business gross profit and gross margin during the year ended december  and  the commercial industrial business segment had gross profit of and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   gross profit is comprised of million from demand response services and million from energy management services 
for the year ended december   gross profit is comprised of million from demand response services and million from energy management services 
the gross margin for both years ended december  and remained consistent at approximately due to the mix of demand response gross margin of approximately and energy management services gross margin of approximately 
operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percent change operating expenses general and administrative expenses marketing and selling expenses research and development expenses amortization of intangible assets impairment charges total not meaningful 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was comprised of an increase of million in expenses arising from the operations of our prior year acquisitions for a full year as well as an increase of million in non cash stock based compensation due to additional award grants as well as a full year of expense for those awards granted during and an increase of million in salaries and benefits  both excluding the increases associated with the acquisitions 
in addition  there was an increase of million in administration expenses related to the build out of our vpc programs and million in professional fees 
the remaining million increase is due to occupancy  insurance  and other expenses such as travel and entertainment 
marketing and selling expenses marketing and selling expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
of the increase  million was due to an increase in expenses arising from the operations of our prior year acquisitions for a full year 
in addition  there were increases of million in non cash stock based compensation due to an increased number of award grants as well as a full year of expense for those awards granted during and million in salaries and benefits  both excluding the increases associated with the acquisitions 
there was also an increase of million in vpc related marketing expense 
we expense customer acquisition costs as incurred 
vpc customer acquisition costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are incurred primarily in connection with the identification  testing and development of new products and software  specifically the development of products to support utility advanced metering infrastructure 
research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to the definite lived intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisitions of enerwise and pes during the second half of impairment charges in our commercial industrial business segment  a rule change for economic demand response programs in the pjm open market during the third quarter caused a decline in the projected operating results for the remainder of and future periods 
based on the reduction of projected operating results in current and future periods  we determined that an interim impairment test of goodwill was required 
the valuation for the goodwill was performed using a discounted cash flow income approach to valuing the business using a discount rate 
the valuation resulted in a non cash impairment of goodwill related to our commercial industrial business segment of million to reflect the carrying value in excess of the fair value 
as a part of the reorganization announced on september   we made the decision to no longer use the enerwise trade name 
accordingly  we recorded the resulting million non cash impairment charge within the commercial industrial business segment 
contemporaneous with our interim goodwill impairment test  we also performed an analysis of the potential impairment and reassessed other identified intangible assets within our commercial industrial business segment 
the impairment analysis for the customer relationships was performed using an excess earnings income approach to valuing the asset using a discount rate 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value to the calculated fair value 
total noncash impairment charges for year ended december  were million 
for the year ended december   the impairment charge  net of tax benefit  per share  was 
interest expense  net net interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  from million of interest income for the year ended december  the increase in expense was mainly due to the interest expense related to the subordinated convertible promissory notes issued in connection with our acquisitions in the second half of other income  net net other income increased to  for the year ended december  from an expense of  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the  gain on extinguishment of debt that we recorded as a result of our prepayment to certain note holders at a discount of their then outstanding balance 
income taxes a tax benefit of million was recorded for the year ended december   compared to tax expense of million for the year ended december  the decrease in the provision for income taxes is primarily due to the enerwise trade name impairment during  which resulted in the removal of the related deferred tax liability from our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we provided a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets because the realization of any future tax benefits could not be sufficiently assured as of december  or year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue the following table summarizes our revenue for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percent change segment revenue utility products services residential business commercial industrial business total not meaningful 
during the year ended december   we classified the results of operations for all vpc contracts in our residential business segment 
during the year ended december   we reclassified our commercial and industrial vpc contract into the newly formed commercial industrial business segment 
the results of operations for have been reclassified for the change 
there were no commercial and industrial vpc contracts in our results of operations during utility products services revenue our utility products services segment had revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in revenue was due to a million increase in superstat revenue and a million increase in digital control unit revenue 
the increases were partially offset by a million decrease in maingate product sales and a million decrease in other products and services 
digital control unit and superstat shipments to third party customers were approximately  units for the year ended december  compared to  units for the year ended december   an increase of 
residential business revenue our residential business segment had revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
a million increase in revenue from our vpc contracts resulted from an increase of million in revenue from our vpc build out offset by a decrease of million in revenue in certain programs due to unfavorable measurement and verification test results as compared to the prior year 
measurement and verification results vary with the electricity demand of high use energy equipment at the time of the measurement and verification tests  which depend on factors such as temperature and humidity 
our existing base load capacity contracts were acquired during the acquisition of pes on september  the operating results of pes are included in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the date of acquisition 
during the period from the date of acquisition to december   we recorded revenue of million from the base load capacity contracts as we continued to build out the energy efficiency programs 
we defer revenue and direct cost under our peaking and base load contracts until such revenue can be made fixed and determinable through a measurement and verification test 
for our base load program  the measurement and verification tests occur throughout the year as certain installation projects are completed 
for our vpc programs  the measurement and verification tests generally occur in the fourth fiscal quarter 
for the fourth quarters ended december  and  we recognized vpc contract revenue of million and million  respectively 
there was also a million increase in revenue from marketing services commencing in we market and manage a real time pricing program that allows participants to better manage their electric costs through hourly pricing 
commercial industrial business revenue we completed the acquisition of enerwise on july  the operating results of enerwise are included in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the date of acquisition 
during the period from the date of acquisition to december   our commercial industrial business segment had revenue of million  consisting of million of demand response services and million of energy management services 
energy management services relate to the upgrade and maintenance of power systems

an increased gross margin percentage resulting from higher margin product revenue contributed million in additional gross profit 
residential business gross profit and gross margin gross profit for our residential business segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
our residential business segment s gross margin percentage for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december   a decrease of 
the gross margin of our residential business segment varies due to factors that significantly impact revenue and cost of revenue but do not necessarily reflect on the underlying profitability of our capacity contracts 
these factors and their related impact include the responsibility to pay participant incentives 
in two of our vpc contracts in effect during the year ended december   we are responsible for paying participant incentives  which are included in our cost of revenue 
in the remaining vpc contracts in effect  our utility customers are responsible for paying participant incentives 
for these three contracts the gross margin will be lower  however  the customer acquisition costs incurred are less  causing the overall profitability of the contract to be consistent with the other vpc contracts which do not involve participant payments 
in  we entered into our third vpc program in which we are responsible for the payment of such participant incentives 
we depreciate our vpc program capital equipment over the remaining contract life  which is shorter than the economic life of such equipment 
as a result  the annual depreciation charge per kilowatt of capacity installed will increase over the term of a vpc contract  while the revenue per kilowatt of capacity for any contract year will be determined by other factors that bear no relation to the depreciation 
during  two of our seven vpc contracts were in the final year  resulting in the cost of load control devices installed in the current year to be fully recognized within  causing a lower gross margin 
nature of the base load capacity project 
pes has the ability to fulfill its contractual obligations for base load capacity through a variety of methods  including completing lighting upgrades in certain locations 
the underlying gross margin may vary  depending on the method selected 
these base load capacity services offered as a result of our pes acquisition provided gross margin of 
commercial industrial business gross profit and gross margin our commercial industrial business segment s gross profit was million  consisting of million of demand response services and million of energy management services 
our commercial industrial business segment s gross margin for its demand response services was approximately 
it is typical for commercial and industrial demand response programs to maintain lower gross margins due to the financial incentive paid to the participating businesses 
our commercial industrial business segment s gross margin for its energy management services was approximately 
the gross margin for these services varies based on the nature of the project 
for example  monitoring and analyzing data typically generates a higher gross margin than design and installation of an electrical generator

subordinated convertible loan agreement 
on june   we entered into a million subordinated convertible debt agreement with a us based lender with a maturity date of june the convertible debt bore interest at three percent plus the three month libor rate 
the convertible debt required payment of interest only provided that we met or exceeded certain pro forma revenue targets calculated on a quarterly basis during the term 
if we did not meet or exceed such revenue targets  at the option of the lender  the convertible debt would amortize ratably over a two year period or such lesser period as remained until the maturity date 
on april   we amended the agreement to allow the holder of the convertible debt to convert a portion of the principal  or the principal as originally provided in the agreement  into our common stock at a price of per share at any time during its term 
subsequent to the amendment  the holder of the convertible debt converted a principal balance of million to  shares during the principal amount of the convertible debt may be prepaid at any time  provided that the payment must include an amount calculated to compensate the lender for interest that would have been paid through the maturity date of the convertible debt  determined by multiplying the principal balance by the current interest rate for each interest paying period from the prepayment date to the maturity date and then discounting the results to the repayment date at an annual rate of 
in addition  in the event of a prepayment of the principal amount  the lender had been provided a non detachable warrant to purchase shares of common stock calculated by dividing the outstanding principal balance by a price per share of  or  shares as of december  the convertible debt is collateralized by a second lien on substantially all of the assets of the company and is subordinated in right of payment to the senior loan agreement 
in conjunction with the entering into the gecc credit agreement  we entered into an amendment whereby the lender of the convertible debt agreed to subordinate its liens against aer assets to the liens of the gecc credit agreement 
on march   the holder of the then outstanding subordinated convertible debt converted the remaining million outstanding balance of subordinated convertible debt for  shares of common stock and terminated the loan and security agreement 
the non detachable warrant related thereto terminated pursuant to its terms

during the year ended december   we offered the note holders a prepayment at of their then outstanding balance 
as of december   we paid million in cash to those note holders who agreed to early extinguishment and recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of  as of december   based on the note conversion price of per share  the remaining million of notes are convertible into an aggregate of up to  shares of our common stock 
in connection with the acquisition of pes  we issued a series of subordinated convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum and will mature on march  interest payments on the notes were made quarterly 
the notes were convertible into  shares of common stock at the option of the holders thereof beginning one year from the date of issuance at a price per share of  which was equal to of the average closing price of common stock for the trading days commencing september   and ending october  on november   we paid the remaining principal to the holders of the subordinated convertible promissory notes issued with the acquisition of pes 
there is no outstanding balance as of december letters of credit our facility with silicon valley bank and our credit agreement with gecc provide for the issuance of up to million of letters of credit

capital spending as of december   our vpc programs had estimated installed capacity of megawatts 
our existing vpc contracts as of december  provided for a potential capacity of megawatts 
we expect to incur approximately million in capital expenditures over the next three years to build out the remaining megawatts under our existing vpc programs  of which million is anticipated to be incurred through december  if we are successful in being awarded additional vpc contracts  we would incur additional amounts to build out these new vpc programs 
non gaap financial measures earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  is defined as net loss before net interest expense  income tax expense  and depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is a non gaap financial measure and is not a substitute for other gaap financial measures such as net loss  operating loss or cash flows from operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
in addition  our calculation of ebitda may or may not be consistent with that of other companies 
we urge you to review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report and our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the other financial information contained in this annual report  and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
ebitda is a common alternative measure of performance used by investors  financial analysts and rating agencies to assess operating performance for companies in our industry 
depreciation is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenue 
we do not believe that this expense is indicative of our core operating performance because the depreciable lives of assets vary greatly depending on the maturity terms of our vpc contracts  which range from three to years 
the clean energy sector has experienced recent trends of increased growth and new company development  which have led to significant variations among companies with respect to capital structures and cost of capital which affect interest expense 
management views interest expense as a by product of capital structure decisions and  therefore  it is not indicative of our core operating performance 
our internal budgets are based on ebitda  and we use ebitda as one of several criteria to determine performance based cash compensation 
we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda before stock based compensation expense and impairment charges 
management does not believe that stock based compensation is indicative of our core operating performance because the stock based compensation is the result of restricted stock and stock option grants which require a noncash expense to be recorded in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
r 
management believes the impairment charge related to the enerwise reporting unit to be not indicative of our core operating performance 
a reconciliation of net loss  the most directly comparable gaap measure  to ebitda and adjusted ebitda for each of the fiscal periods indicated is as follows in thousands year ended december  net loss depreciation and amortization interest expense income  net provision benefit for income taxes ebitda non cash stock compensation expense non cash impairment charge adjusted ebitda commitments and contingencies we are a party to various legal proceedings and claims of which the outcomes are subject to significant uncertainty 
our policy is to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters  as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the liability required  if any  for these contingencies is made after an analysis of each known issue in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and related pronouncements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 a liability is recorded when we determine that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  we disclose contingencies for which a material loss is reasonably possible  but not probable 
as of december   there were no material contingencies requiring accrual or disclosure 
contractual obligations information regarding our known contractual obligations of the types described below as of december  is set forth in the following table dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years bank debt obligations cash interest payments on debt operating lease obligations subordinated convertible promissory notes total we are contractually obligated to make certain contingent payments of approximately million under an exclusive licensing agreement for certain product technology 
additionally  as part of our contractual obligations  we have the option to maintain licensing exclusivity on an annual basis by making payments ranging from million to million over the next three years 
we are also obligated to pay royalties to the licensor for each unit sold that incorporates the licensed technology 
such royalties are reduced by the amount of optional exclusivity payments described above 
these payments have been excluded from the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  marketable securities and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
a summary of our critical accounting policies is set forth below 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  collection is probable  and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
in accordance with sab  we defer revenue and associated cost of revenue related to certain residential and small commercial long term vpc contracts until such time as the annual contract payment is fixed and determinable 
revenue is invoiced on a monthly or quarterly basis throughout the contract year 
the vpc contracts require us to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility customers  and require a measurement and verification of such capacity on an annual basis in order to determine final contract consideration for a given contract year 
contract years typically begin at the end of a control season generally  at the end of a utility s summer cooling season that correlates to the end of the utility s peak demand for electricity and continue for twelve months thereafter 
we enter into agreements to provide base load capacity services to utilities or commercial and industrial end customers 
base load capacity revenues are earned based on our ability to achieve committed capacity through load reduction 
in order to provide capacity  we deliver and install demand side management measures to a portfolio of commercial and industrial end customers 
the base load capacity contracts require us to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility customers  and include a measurement and verification of such capacity in order to determine contract consideration 
in accordance with sab  we defer revenue and associated cost of revenue in our electric load reduction services until such time as the capacity amount  and therefore the related revenue  is fixed and determinable 
once the capacity amount has been verified  the revenue is recognized 
if the revenue is subject to penalty  refund or an ongoing obligation  the revenue is deferred until the contingency is resolved and or we have met our performance obligation 
our base load capacity contracts are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which requires us to assess whether the different elements qualify for separate accounting 
the deliverables in these arrangements are accounted for as separate elements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized for each element by applying the residual method under eitf no 
since there is objective evidence of fair value of only the undelivered item 
the amount allocated to the delivered item is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of the additional element 
we enter into agreements to provide demand response and capacity event services 
the demand response contracts require us to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility end customers when the utility or independent system operator calls a demand response event to curtail electrical usage 
demand response revenues are earned based on our ability to deliver capacity 
in order to provide capacity  we manage a portfolio of commercial and industrial end users electric loads 
capacity amounts are verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a customer initiated demand response test 
in accordance with sab  we recognize revenue and associated cost of revenue in our demand response services at such time as the capacity amount is fixed and determinable 
we register with certain independent service operators in order to participate in capacity 
the capacity year for our primary capacity program spans from june st to may st annually 
for participation  we receive cash payments on a monthly basis in the capacity year 
participation in the capacity program requires us to respond to requests from the service operator to curtail energy usage during the mandatory performance period of june through september  which is the peak demand season 
in accordance with sab  the annual payments for a capacity year are recognized at the end of the mandatory performance period  once the revenue is fixed and determinable 
capacity event services revenue is contingent revenue earned based upon the actual amount of energy provided during the capacity event 
contingent revenue from capacity events is recognized when the capacity amount  and therefore the related revenue  is fixed and determinable 
we sell hardware products directly to utilities for use and deployment by the utility 
in addition  we provide installation services under a long term service contract with our customer 
we recognize revenue for such sales when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and all other criteria of sab have been met 
we have certain contracts which are multiple element arrangements and provide for several deliverables to the customer that may include installation services  right to use software  hardware and hosting services 
these contracts require no significant production  modification or customization of the software or hardware  and the software is not essential to the functionality of the hardware 
therefore  consistent with the guidance in eitf no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  hardware and related services are considered non software deliverables 
accordingly  we apply the provisions of eitf no 
to separate deliverables and allocate the total arrangement consideration 
we evaluate each deliverable to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting based on the following criteria a whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand along basis  b whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items  and c if the contract includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if objective and reliable evidence of fair value exits for all units of accounting in the arrangement  revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on relative fair values 
each unit of accounting is then accounted for under the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
in situations in which there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all undelivered elements but not for delivered elements  the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement s consideration 
for multiple element arrangements including hosting  we apply eitf no 
 application of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
for certain contracts that include software hosting services  the customer may not have the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty 
therefore  in accordance with eitf  aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  does not apply to these contracts 
because we do not have objective evidence of the fair value of each element  the elements do not qualify for separate accounting as discussed above 
accordingly  revenue for all elements is recognized ratably over the longer of the estimated customer relationship period or the life of the contract  once all revenue recognition requirements are met 
straight line attribution is used because there is no other discernible pattern of use that suggests that revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
revenue from time and materials service contracts and other services are recognized as services are provided 
revenue from certain fixed price contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis  which involves the use of estimates 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure the progress towards completion  revenue is recognized when the project is completed or when final acceptance is received from the customer 
we also enter into agreements to provide hosting services that allow customers to monitor and analyze their electrical usage 
revenue from hosting contracts is recognized as the services are provided  generally on a recurring monthly basis 
revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
all of our identifiable finite lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method 
we use estimates in determining the value of goodwill and intangible assets  including estimates of useful lives of intangible assets  discounted future cash flows and fair values of the related operations 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually as of december or as events or changes in circumstances warrant such test  under the guidance of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we forecast discounted future cash flows at the reporting unit level based on estimated future revenues and operating expenses  which take into consideration factors such as estimated payments on long term contracts  expected future orders  supplier contracts and general market conditions 
changes in our forecasts or expense of capital may result in asset value adjustments  which could have a significant affect on our current and future results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
intangible assets with a finite life are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r  share based payment  for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively  before income taxes 
upon adopting sfas no 
r  for awards with service conditions and graded vesting  a one time election was made to recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
for options with performance and or service conditions only  we utilized the black scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value of options issued 
for restricted stock awards with service conditions  we utilized the intrinsic value method 
for awards with market conditions  the company utilized a lattice model to estimate the award fair value and the derived service period 
each of the grants with service and market conditions include three components a a performance incentive  representing of the total value of each grant  that measures the performance of comverge s stock against the performance of a peer group over a three year period  b a retention incentive  representing of the total value of each grant  to encourage recipients to continue their service with comverge  and c a stock price incentive  representing of the total value of each grant  tied to the company s stock price achieving certain target prices over time the price grant 
the portion of a recipient s grant represented by the price grant will vest in equal increments upon comverge sustaining a stock price equal to or greater than   and per share  each for a separate continuous day period prior to february  we account for stock issued to consultants on a fair value basis in accordance with sfas no

this fsp is effective for years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on its calculation of eps 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk we face minimal exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
historically  our primary exposures have related to non dollar denominated sales and expenses in the canadian dollar  the israeli shekel  and the south african rand 
we do not utilize any foreign currency exchange transactions to hedge our exposure 
foreign currency gains for the years ended december   and were immaterial 
interest rate risk as of december   million of our outstanding debt was at fixed interest rates and million of outstanding debt was at floating interest rates 
based on outstanding floating rate debt of million as of december   an increase of in the prime rate or the three month libor rate would result in an increase in our interest expense of approximately  per year 
market value of portfolio investments we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
as of december   we had million of investments in money market funds  commercial paper and corporate debentures bonds recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 
these investments are exposed to fluctuations in market values and could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations
