table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the results of our operations for the twelve months ended december   and and of our financial condition at december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and that are not historical facts  including statements about our beliefs and expectations 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and particularly under the headings risk factors  business and forward looking statements contained in item a  item  and part i of this report  respectively 
aspen s year in review our principal objective in was to continue to diversify into profitable new lines of insurance business with limited correlation to the existing insurance and reinsurance business  while maintaining a high quality investment portfolio 
during  we entered a number of new business lines while scaling back others 
we maintained a high quality fixed income portfolio and reduced our investment in funds of hedge funds  while ensuring appropriate levels of liquidity to support the business 
capital management 
during  we continued to execute our strategy to optimize our capital structure 
our total shares outstanding reduced from  at the end of to  at december  mainly as a result of the purchase and cancellation of  shares on may  for a consideration of million from candover  the last of our founding shareholders 
the repurchase was executed under the share repurchase program authorized by our board on february  which authorized the purchase of up to million of our ordinary shares in the period to march  diversification 
during  we established syndicate at lloyd s  which commenced underwriting for business incepting on or after may  syndicate provides an additional distribution platform 
in  the business written by syndicate covered energy  hull  marine liability  transportation related liability and aviation 
in addition  we entered the financial and political risks  financial institutions and management and technology liability markets in which are written through aspen uk we also obtained authorization to underwrite general insurance business in australia and reinsurance in singapore 
investment management 
we have reduced our allocation of cash and invested assets in funds of hedge funds from in to at december  and in february  we gave notice to redeem all of our remaining hedge fund investments 
in the second half of  we also reduced our exposure to financial institutions fixed income securities as part of our investment risk management strategy 
the duration of our fixed income portfolio has reduced from approximately years at december  to years at december  and the book yield on our fixed income portfolio has reduced from at december  to at december  in  we also recognized other than temporary impairment charges of million  of which million was related to our holdings of lehman brothers senior and subordinated debt 
at december   approximately by market value of our fixed interest securities comprised asset backed and mortgage backed securities  none of which in our opinion falls into the sub prime category 
we had negligible direct exposure to hybrid and preferred securities 
financial overview the following overview of our  and operating results and financial condition is intended to identify important themes and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion further below 

table of contents net income 
for  we reported income after taxes of million  a million reduction over the prior year 
the reduction is due to a combination of adverse underwriting performance mainly arising from losses of million  net of reinsurance recoveries  reinstatement premiums and tax following hurricanes ike and gustav and adverse investment performance due to the turmoil in the financial markets which has resulted in losses of million from our investment in funds of hedge funds and million of investment impairment charges 
this contrasts with which was not impacted by any significant catastrophic events while enjoying significant positive returns 
gross written premiums 
total gross written premiums increased by in compared to but reduced by in compared to the changes in gross written premiums in each of our segments for the twelve months ended december  and are as follows  with reductions shown as negative percentages 
gross written premiums for the twelve months for the twelve months for the twelve months business segment ended december  ended december  ended december  in millions increase in millions increase in millions decrease decrease property reinsurance casualty reinsurance international insurance us insurance total the increase in gross written premiums in was driven by a million contribution from new underwriting teams in international insurance established in the final quarter of and during this was offset by premium reductions in a number of our established lines  in particular property treaty catastrophe  property treaty risk excess  international casualty treaty reinsurance and uk commercial liability insurance 
we wrote less business in than in as a result of a number of factors  including a less favorable pricing environment in many lines of business  in particular property catastrophe reinsurance  casualty treaty reinsurance  and uk commercial liability insurance and the re positioning of our us excess and surplus lines property insurance business 
gross written premiums in our casualty reinsurance segment were also reduced in by the relocation of our casualty facultative business from our marlton  new jersey office to rocky hill  connecticut and a change in underwriting approach 
reinsurance 
total reinsurance ceded in the year ended december  of million was million lower than in the corresponding period in the overall reduction was due to our ability to take advantage of favorable pricing conditions in which enabled us to purchase a number of reinsurance contracts covering a period of greater than months  effectively covering the windstorm season 
costs in have also been impacted by the recognition of million of additional reinsurance premiums to reinstate cover from our reinsurance program following hurricane ike 
reinsurance costs in decreased by million compared to as we reduced our reliance on outwards reinsurance  in line with our reduction in exposure in property reinsurance 
loss ratio 
we monitor the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premium the loss ratio as a measure of relative underwriting performance where a lower ratio represents a 
table of contents better result than a higher ratio 
the loss ratios for our four business segments for the twelve months ended december   and were as follows loss ratios for the twelve months for the twelve months for the twelve months business segment ended december  ended december  ended december  property reinsurance casualty reinsurance international insurance us insurance total the net loss ratio for the twelve months ended december  of is percentage points higher than the loss ratio for the same period in and the increase in the property reinsurance loss ratio in was due mainly to million of losses  net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement costs  associated with hurricanes ike and gustav 
these losses increased the loss ratio by percentage points compared to the combination of limited catastrophe losses during the year ended december  and million of reserve strengthening in compared to a million strengthening in  produced a meaningful favorable variance in the property reinsurance loss ratio between and the loss ratio for casualty reinsurance improved to from in mainly as a result of favorable development on prior accident years  particularly in our us casualty treaty line 
reserve releases increased from million in to million in this was partially offset by the inclusion in of million of additional reserves related to the global credit crisis 
in  we recognized reserves of million in addition to million of losses resulting from our normal expectations within this segment associated with the global credit crisis 
in  the international insurance segment suffered from million of net losses and million of net additional reinstatement costs following hurricanes ike and gustav  increasing the loss ratio by percentage points 
the loss ratio was also impacted by a net reserve strengthening of million  due to adverse prior year deterioration in respect of california wildfires and also from shipowners liability  both in our marine and energy liability lines  compared to an million reserve release in in compared to the international insurance segment included some moderate sized losses in both the marine and aviation books  offset by prior year releases within the uk commercial liability account 
the us insurance segment suffered in from million of net losses from hurricanes ike and gustav  which increased the loss ratio by percentage points 
in  us property insurance benefited from improved loss experience and us casualty insurance benefited from prior year reserve releases  when compared to reserve releases 
the loss ratios take into account any changes in our assessments of reserves for unpaid claims and loss adjustment expenses arising from earlier years 
in each of the years ended december   and  we recorded a reduction in the level of reserves for prior years 
the amounts of these reductions and their effects on the loss ratio in each year are shown in the following table for the twelve months for the twelve months for the twelve months ended december  ended december  ended december  in millions  except for percentages reserve releases of net premiums earned 
table of contents the reserve releases in were million lower than in due predominantly to reserve strengthening in our international insurance segment compared to reserve releases in prior years 
the reserve releases in benefited from a significant release in our uk commercial liability line due to favorable experience 
excluding the impact of deterioration in of million associated with the hurricanes  net reserve releases were of net premiums earned at december  further information relating to the release of reserves can be found below under reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses prior year loss reserves 
expense ratio 
we monitor the ratio of expenses to net earned premium the expense ratio as a measure of the cost effectiveness of our business acquisition  operating and administrative processes 
the table below presents the contribution of the policy acquisition expenses and operating and administrative expenses to the expense ratio and the total expense ratios for the twelve months ended december   and expense ratios for the for the for the twelve months ended twelve months ended twelve months ended december  december  december  policy acquisition expenses operating and administrative expenses expense ratio policy acquisition expenses have decreased from million in to million in  due primarily to a million reduction in profit commissions payable to policyholders 
the reduction in policy acquisition expenses in was largely due to the impact of the reduction in our reinsurance purchases 
operating and administrative expenses increased by million when compared to  due mainly to a million rise in costs in our international insurance segment resulting from our entry into new business lines  which was partially offset by a reduction in performance related remuneration and a weakening of the british pound against the us dollar 
the increases in operating and administrative expenses in compared to reflected increased bonus and long term incentive charges and increased costs in bermuda  the us and the us due to the hiring of new teams of underwriters and increased investment in support functions and infrastructure 
investment income 
in  we generated net investment income of million  down on the prior year million  million 
the reduction was mainly due to losses from our investments in funds of hedge funds  which contributed a gain of million in compared to a loss of million in net investment income increased by in when compared to driven by rising interest rates  fixed income sector allocation changes translating into higher book yields and increases in total cash and investment balance 
our fixed income portfolio book yield reduced to at december  from at the end of 
total cash and investments increased from billion at the start of to billion at year end billion 
the fixed income portfolio duration decreased from years to years years and the average credit quality of our fixed income book is aaa  with of the portfolio being graded aa or higher 
the average credit quality of our fixed income investment portfolio was aa at the end of and aaa at the end of the allocation to funds of hedge funds reduced from of the portfolio to at the end of these alternative investments produced an annualized return in  compared with a annualized loss in 
table of contents we first invested in funds of hedge funds on april  with an initial investment of million 
at december  the investment in funds of hedge funds was million or of our portfolio and during we recognized million of investment income from our investment in these funds 
change in fair value of derivatives 
in the twelve months ended december   we recorded a reduction in the fair value of derivatives of million million reduction  million reduction 
this included a reduction of million million  nil in the estimated fair value of our credit insurance contract 
in the twelve months ended december   a charge of million for a catastrophe swap which expired on august  was also included million 
in addition  at december  we held foreign currency derivative contracts to purchase million of us and foreign currencies 
the foreign currency contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value with changes recorded as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss in our statement of operations 
for the twelve months ended december   the impact of foreign currency contracts on net income is a loss of million loss of million  nil 
further information on these contracts can be found in notes and to the financial statements 
other revenues and expenses 
other revenues and expenses in included million of foreign currency exchange losses million gains  million gains and million of realized investment losses million  million 
the increase in realized investment losses in was due to million of charges associated with investments we believe to be other than temporarily impaired nil  nil which were offset by million of realized gains resulting from the sale of investments in the ordinary course of business 
interest payable was million in million  million 
other than temporary impairments 
we review all of our fixed maturities for potential impairment each quarter based on criteria including issuer specific circumstances  credit ratings actions and general macro economic conditions 
the process of determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary requires considerable judgment 
as part of the assessment process we also evaluate our ability and intent to hold any fixed maturity security in an unrealized loss position until its market value recovers to amortized cost 
once a security has been identified as other than temporarily impaired  the amount of any impairment is determined by reference to that security s estimated fair value and recorded as a charge to realized losses included in earnings 
in light of the recent turmoil in the financial markets  we have recognized other than temporary impairment charges of million for the twelve months ended december  nil  nil  of which million is related to our holdings in lehman brothers where we wrote our subordinated debt down to a value of zero and our senior debt down to of its original par value 
although our holdings in lehman brothers are in default  the market value of these securities was derived based on broker dealer prices 
management believes that this valuation is  in part  based on market expectations of future recoveries from lehman brothers bankruptcy proceedings 
in addition to our holdings in lehman brothers  we recognized other than temporary impairments for several other securities in our investment portfolio 
while such securities retained their investment grade ratings and timely continuation of interest and principal payments  they were priced at a significant discount to cost 
notwithstanding our intent and ability to hold these securities until maturity  and despite structures that indicate that a substantial amount of the securities should continue to perform in accordance with original terms  we could not assert that the recovery period would be temporary under the current accounting standards 
taxes 
we incurred a tax expense in of million million  equivalent to a consolidated rate on income before tax of compared to in and in the increase in the effective rate of tax in is due to the distribution of insurance and investment losses 
table of contents within the group between our bermuda and uk operating companies  particularly in the fourth quarter of dividends 
the quarterly dividend has been maintained at per ordinary share for  and dividends paid on the preference shares in were million and the full amounts payable and paid annually in each of and were million 
shareholders equity and financial leverage 
total shareholders equity reduced from  million at the end of to  million as of december  the most significant movements were net income after tax for the year of million  an increase in net of tax unrealized gains on investments of million  accounted for in other comprehensive income  dividend payments to ordinary and preference shareholders totaling million in  and a share repurchase of million in may as at december   total ordinary shareholders equity was  million compared to  million at december  as at december   the remainder of our total shareholders equity was funded by two classes of preference shares with a total value as measured by their respective liquidation preferences of million million less issue costs of million million 
the amounts outstanding under our senior notes were the only material debt that we had outstanding as of december  and management monitors the ratio of debt to total capital  with total capital being defined as shareholders equity plus outstanding debt 
at december   this ratio was  
our preference shares are classified in our balance sheet as equity but may receive a different treatment in some cases under the capital adequacy assessments made by certain rating agencies 
such securities are often referred to as hybrids as they have certain attributes of both debt and equity 
we also monitor the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital which was as of december  diluted tangible book value per ordinary share at december  was  an increase of compared to at december  tangible book value per ordinary share is based on total shareholders equity  less intangible assets and preference shares liquidation preference less issue expenses  divided by the number of ordinary shares in issue at the end of the period 
balances as at december  and december  were as at as at december  december  in millions  except for share amounts total shareholders equity intangible assets preference shares less issue expenses ordinary shares diluted ordinary shares liquidity 
management monitors the liquidity of aspen holdings and of each of its insurance subsidiaries 
with respect to aspen holdings  management monitors its ability to service debt  to finance dividend payments and to provide financial support to the insurance subsidiaries 
during the period 
table of contents ended december   aspen holdings received a million dividend payment from aspen bermuda and a million payment of inter company interest in respect of an inter company loan and a million dividend from aspen uk holdings 
as at december   aspen holdings held million in cash and cash equivalents which  taken together with our credit facilities and expected levels of future inter company dividends  management considered sufficient to provide us with an appropriate level of liquidity 
at december   the insurance subsidiaries held million in cash and cash equivalents that are readily realizable securities 
management monitors the value  currency and duration of the cash and investments within its insurance subsidiaries to ensure that they are individually able to meet their insurance and other liabilities as they become due and was satisfied that there was a comfortable margin of liquidity as at december  and for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had in issue million and million in letters of credit to cedants  against which we held million and million of collateral 
our reinsurance receivables decreased by from million at december  to million at december   mainly as a result of amounts received from our reinsurers in respect of hurricane claims 
the reduction in recoveries associated with the hurricanes was offset by the recognition of million in for recoveries from hurricanes ike and gustav 
current market conditions  rate trends and developments in early in summary  many lines of business are experiencing good levels of rate increase and we believe this trend will continue as progresses 
our challenge in is to allocate the appropriate level of capital for each business line and to increase our exposure to those lines that are experiencing the most significant rate increases while moderating our exposure to lines which have not adjusted their rates 
property reinsurance 
our property reinsurance segment is experiencing significant rate increases for us peak zone catastrophe contracts with rates rising by or more on renewals at january  we expect this upwards trend to continue throughout rate increases on regional us business  however  have seen more moderate increases 
accounts that include european wind exposure experienced rate increases of on average 
rates on european business that is not exposed to wind perils have not moved significantly from those encountered at the end of casualty reinsurance 
our us casualty reinsurance business has encountered early signs of rate increases in the january renewals 
general and umbrella liability lines have reversed their mid double digit rate declines to a smaller single digit decrease or a flat renewal 
high levels of competition continue on certain more attractive and loss free accounts  however terms and conditions continue to be reasonable 
international casualty reinsurance has seen rate increases between and depending on the class of business and loss experience 
terms and conditions were broadly steady with small improvements 
we recorded an average rate increase of on renewal business across our international casualty line 
international insurance 
our international insurance segment achieved an average rate increase of on renewal business reflecting an improving rate environment in a number of our lines of business  in particular marine hull and marine and energy liability for which january is an important renewal period 
in marine hull  the rate environment is improving in part due to reduced market capacity and we achieved average effective rate increases of on our book 
we achieved significant increases on our marine  energy and construction liability book of on average 
us insurance 
in us property insurance  rates continue to vary between above and below expiring premium however there are some exceptions outside of this range 
for larger property accounts requiring a number of market participants  rate increases between and have been achieved 
property rates remain heavily bi furcated between business exposed to catastrophes and those that are not  with the former more likely to see increases 
in us casualty insurance  we maintained our 
table of contents disciplined underwriting approach and we were able to secure renewal orders at rates equivalent to those achieved at the end of recent developments we have recently announced that dr 
norman rosenthal  one of our directors  will not be standing for re election at our next annual general meeting on april  in respect of our notice of redemption of approximately of our investments in funds of hedge funds  we have received proceeds of million in january  with the remaining balance of million together with interest earned thereon if any  to be paid subject to audit adjustments promptly after completion of the audit of the fund s books for the year in which such redemption occurs 
in february  we gave notice of redemption to our funds of hedge funds managers in respect of the remaining million of our alternative investments 
the earliest date at which these notices will take effect is june  and we will remain exposed to changes in the net asset value of the funds until at least that date 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective in nature and require management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine the reported values 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a statement of all the significant accounting policies we use to prepare our financial statements is included in the notes to the financial statements 
if factors such as those described in item a  risk factors cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policy and calculating financial results  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
written premiums 
written premiums are comprised of the estimated premiums on contracts of insurance and reinsurance entered into in the reporting period  except in the case of proportional reinsurance contracts  where written premium relates only to our estimated proportional share of premiums due on contracts entered into by the ceding company prior to the end of the reporting period 
all premium estimates are reviewed regularly  comparing actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the collectability of premiums receivable 
based on management s review  the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated  and any adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the periods in which they become known 
adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and these adjustments may directly and significantly impact earnings in the period they are determined because the subject premium may be fully or substantially earned 
we refer to premiums receivable which are not fixed at the inception of the contract as adjustment premiums 
the proportion of adjustable premiums included in the premium estimates varies between business lines with the largest adjustment premiums associated with property and casualty reinsurance business and the smallest with property and liability insurance lines 
adjustment premiums are most significant in relation to reinsurance contracts 
differing considerations apply to non proportional and proportional treaties as follows non proportional treaties 
a large number of the reinsurance contracts we write are written on a non proportional or excess of loss treaty basis 
as the ultimate level of business written by each cedant can only be estimated at the time the reinsurance is placed  the reinsurance contracts generally stipulate a minimum and deposit premium payable under the contract with an adjustable premium determined by variables such as the number of contracts covered by the reinsurance  the total premium received by the cedant and the nature of the exposures assumed 
minimum and deposit premiums generally cover the majority of premiums due under such treaty reinsurance contracts and the adjustable portion of the 
table of contents premium is usually a small portion of the total premium receivable 
for excess of loss contracts  the minimum and deposit premium  as defined in the contract  is generally considered to be the best estimate of the contract s written premium at inception 
accordingly  this is the amount we generally record as written premium in the period the underlying risks incept 
during the life of a contract  notifications from cedants and brokers may affect the estimate of ultimate premium and result in either increases or reductions in reported revenue 
changes in estimated adjustable premiums do not generally have a significant impact on short term liquidity as the payment of adjustment premiums generally occurs after the expiration of a contract 
many non proportional treaties also include a provision for the payment to us by the cedant of reinstatement premiums based on loss experience under such contracts 
reinstatement premiums are the premiums charged for the restoration of the reinsurance limit of an excess of loss contract to its full amount after payment by the reinsurer of losses as a result of an occurrence 
these premiums relate to the future coverage obtained during the remainder of the initial policy term and are included in revenue in the same period as the corresponding losses 
proportional treaties treaty pro rata 
estimates of premiums assumed under treaty pro rata reinsurance contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by brokers and ceding companies and estimates of the underlying economic conditions at the time the risk is underwritten 
we estimate premium receivable initially and update our estimates regularly throughout the contract term based on treaty statements received from the ceding company 
the reported gross written premiums for treaty pro rata business include estimates of premiums due to us but not yet reported by the cedant because of time delays between contracts being written by our cedants and their submission of treaty statements to us 
this additional premium is normally described as pipeline premium 
treaty statements disclose information on the underlying contracts of insurance written by our cedants and are generally submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis  from to days in arrears 
in order to report all risks incepting prior to a period end  we estimate the premiums written between the last submitted treaty statement and the period end 
the segment for which treaty pro rata is most relevant is our property reinsurance segment in which we wrote million in gross written premium in million or of our property reinsurance segment  of which million was estimated million and million was reported by the cedants million 
we estimate that the impact of a million change in our estimated gross premiums written in our property treaty pro rata business would have an impact of million on our net income before tax for our property reinsurance segment at december  million  excluding the impact of fixed costs such as reinsurance premiums and operating expenses 
the most likely drivers of change in the estimates in decreasing order of magnitude are changes in the renewal rate or rate of new business acceptances by the cedant insurance companies leading to lower or greater volumes of ceded premiums than our estimate  which could result from changes in the relevant primary market that could affect more than one of our cedants or could be a consequence of changes in marketing strategy or risk appetite by a particular cedant  changes in the rates being charged by cedants  and differences between the pattern of inception dates assumed in our estimate and the actual pattern of inception dates 
we anticipate that ultimate premiums might reasonably be expected to vary by up to as a result of variations in one or more of the assumptions described above  although larger variations are possible 
based on gross written premiums of million in our property reinsurance treaty pro rata account as of december   a variation of could increase or reduce net income before taxation by approximately million 

table of contents earned premiums 
premiums are recognized as earned evenly over the policy periods using the daily pro rata method 
the premium related to the unexpired portion of each policy at the end of the reporting period is included in the balance sheet as unearned premiums 
premiums receivable 
premiums receivable are recorded as amounts due less any required provision for doubtful accounts 
a significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable  which represent estimated premiums written  net of commissions  is not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts 
in determining whether or not any bad debt provision is necessary  we consider the financial security of the policyholder  past payment history and any collateral held 
we have not made a provision for doubtful accounts in relation to assumed premium estimates 
in addition  based on the above process  management believes that the premium estimates included in premiums receivable will be collectable and  therefore  we have not maintained a bad debt provision for doubtful accounts on the premiums at december  catastrophe swap 
on august   aspen bermuda entered into a risk transfer swap cat swap with a non insurance counterparty 
during the cat swap s year term  which ended on august   aspen bermuda made quarterly payments based on an initial notional amount of million 
in return  aspen bermuda was entitled to receive payments of up to million in total if hurricanes made landfall in florida and caused damage in excess of billion or earthquakes in california caused insured damage in excess of billion 
the latest estimate of the insured loss arising from hurricane katrina published by pcs on june  was billion  which entitled us to a recovery of approximately million which has been paid to us 
we have decided not to extend the development period under the cat swap and will not be making any further recoveries 
this cat swap falls within the scope of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and is therefore measured in the balance sheet at fair value with any changes in the fair value shown on the consolidated statement of operations 
the contract expired on august  and has no impact on net income in the twelve months ended december  the impact of this contract on net income at december  was million 
credit insurance contract 
on november   the company entered into a credit insurance contract which  subject to its terms  insures us against losses due to the inability of one or more of our reinsurance counterparties to meet their financial obligations to us 
we consider that under sfas this contract is a financial guarantee insurance contract that does not qualify for exemption from treatment for accounting purposes as a derivative 
this is because it provides for the final settlement  expected to take place two years after expiry of cover  to include an amount attributable to outstanding and ibnr claims which may not at that point of time be due and payable to us 
as a result of the application of derivative accounting rules under sfas  the contract is treated as an asset and measured at the directors estimate of its fair value 
changes in the estimated fair value from time to time will be included in the consolidated statement of operations 
the contract is for a maximum of five years and provides cover for a named panel of reinsurers up to individual defined sub limits 
the contract does allow  subject to certain conditions  for substitution and replacement of panel members if our panel of reinsurers changes 
payments are made on a quarterly basis throughout the period of the contract based on the aggregate limit  which was set initially at million but is subject to adjustment 
reserving approach 
we take all reasonable steps to ensure that we have appropriate information regarding our claims exposures 
however  given the uncertainty in establishing claims liabilities  it is likely that the final outcome will prove to be different from the original provision established 
prior to the selection by management of the reserves to be included in our financial statements  our actuarial 
table of contents team employs a number of techniques to establish a range of estimates from which they consider it reasonable for management to select a best estimate the actuarial range 
sources of information 
claims information received typically includes the loss date  details of the claim  the recommended reserve and reports from the loss adjusters dealing with the claim 
in respect of pro rata treaties we receive regular statements bordereaux which provide paid and outstanding claims information  often with large losses separately identified 
following widely reported loss events such as natural catastrophes and airplane crashes we adopt a proactive approach to establish our likely exposure to claims by reviewing policy listings and contacting brokers and policyholders as appropriate 
reported claims 
for reported claims  reserves are established on a case by case basis within the parameters of coverage provided in the insurance policy or reinsurance agreement 
in estimating the cost of these claims  we consider circumstances related to the claims as reported  any information available from cedants and loss adjustors and information on the cost of settling claims with similar characteristics in previous periods 
in addition  for significant events such as the and hurricanes  for example  the detailed analysis of our potential exposures includes information obtained directly from cedants which has yet to be processed through market systems enabling us to reduce the time lag between a significant event occurring and establishing case reserves 
this additional information is also incorporated into the analysis used to determine the actuarial ibnr 
reinsurance intermediaries are used to assist in obtaining and validating information from cedants but we establish all reserves 
in addition  we may engage loss adjusters and perform on site cedant audits to validate the information provided 
disputes do occur with cedants  but the number and frequency are generally low 
in the event of a dispute  intermediaries are used to try to resolve the dispute 
if a resolution cannot be reached  then the contracts typically provide for binding arbitration 
ibnr claims 
we establish reserves for ibnr claims using established actuarial methods which generally rely to a greater or lesser extent on historical information but also consider such variables as changes in policy terms and coverage  changes in legislative conditions and judicial interpretation of insurance policies and inflation 
we take into account the quality of the historical information available and where appropriate historical trends are used to validate information received from cedants 
a higher degree of uncertainty is associated with setting reserves for reinsurance business owing to the longer reporting pattern and time to final settlement 
where ibnr is based on an analysis of past loss experience  the principal assumption is that past patterns of development are a reasonable proxy for current business after allowance for any changes in underlying mix of business 
the process of extrapolation is by necessity one involving subjective judgment because the actuary has to take into account the impact of the changing business mix as well as changes in legislative conditions  changes in judicial interpretation of legal liability policy coverages and inflation 
these factors are incorporated in the actuarial range 
for lines of business where early claims experience may not provide a sound statistical basis to estimate the loss reserves  our approach is to establish an initial expected loss and loss expense ratio 
this is based on one or more of a an analysis of our own claims experience to date  b market benchmark data  c a contract by contract analysis  and d an analysis of a portfolio of similar business written by syndicate  as available  adjusted by an index reflecting how insurance rates  term and conditions have changed 
this initial expected loss and loss expense ratio is then modified in light of the actual experience to date measured against the expected experience 
loss reserves for known catastrophic events are based upon a detailed analysis of our reported losses and potential exposures conducted in conjunction with our underwriters 

table of contents actuarial range of gross reserves 
the following table sets out the actuarial range of gross reserves for each of our segments and compares it to management s selected best estimate as at december  as at december  management s lower end upper end selected of actuarial of actuarial gross reserves reserve range range in millions property reinsurance casualty reinsurance international insurance us insurance potential variation total gross losses and loss expense reserves the actuarial ranges are not intended to include the minimum or maximum amount that the claims may ultimately settle at  but are designed to provide management with ranges from which it is reasonable to select a single best estimate for inclusion in our financial statements 
the amounts shown for the lower and upper ends of the actuarial range are different from the sums of the corresponding amounts for the four segments 
the difference  which we show in the tables as potential variation  takes into account the fact that at the higher end of the actuarial range we do not expect all segments to deteriorate at the same time hence the variation credit and  conversely  at the lower end of the actuarial range not all segments will improve simultaneously hence the debit 
selection of reported gross reserves 
in arriving at our selected reserves for each line of business we take into account all of the factors set out above  and in particular the quality of the historical information we have on which to establish our reserves 
actuarial range of net reserves 
in determining the range of net reserves  we estimate recoveries due under our proportional and excess of loss reinsurance programs 
for proportional reinsurance we apply the appropriate cession percentages to estimate how much of the gross reserves will be collectable 
for excess of loss recoveries  individual large losses are modeled through our reinsurance program 
an assessment is also made of the collectability of reinsurance recoveries taking into account market data on the financial strength of each of the reinsurance companies 
the net actuarial range for reserves for losses and loss expenses assuming that net reserves move in proportion to gross would be between  million and  million 
the actual net reserves established as at december  were  million 
uncertainties 
while the reported reserves make a reasonable provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense obligations  we note that the process of estimating required reserves does  by its very nature  involve uncertainty and therefore the ultimate claims may fall outside the actuarial range 
the level of uncertainty can be influenced by such factors as the existence of coverage with long duration reporting patterns and changes in claims handling practices  as well as the other factors described above 
because many of the coverages underwritten involve claims that may not be ultimately settled for many years after they are incurred  subjective judgments as to the ultimate exposure to losses are an integral and necessary component of the loss reserving process 
we review regularly our reserves  using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claims costs  frequency and severity data  and prevailing economic  social and legal factors 
reserves established in prior periods are adjusted as claims experience develops and new information becomes available 
estimates of ibnr are generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than estimates of the cost of settling claims already notified to us  where more information about the claim event is generally available 
ibnr claims often may not be apparent to the insured until many years after the event giving 
table of contents rise to the claims has happened 
lines of business where the ibnr proportion of the total reserve is high  such as liability insurance  will typically display greater variations between initial estimates and final outcomes because of the greater degree of difficulty of estimating these reserves 
lines of business where claims are typically reported relatively quickly after the claim event tend to display lower levels of volatility between initial estimates and final outcomes 
reinsurance claims are subject to a longer time lag both in their reporting and in their time to final settlement 
the time lag is a factor which is included in the projections to ultimate claims within the actuarial analyses and helps to explain why in general a higher proportion of the initial reinsurance reserves are represented by ibnr than for insurance reserves for business in the same class 
delays in receiving information from cedants are an expected part of normal business operations and are included within the statistical estimate of ibnr to the extent that current levels of backlog are consistent with historical data 
currently  there are no processing backlogs which would materially affect our financial statements 
allowance is made  however  for changes or uncertainties which may create distortions in the underlying statistics or which might cause the cost of unsettled claims to increase or reduce when compared with the cost of previously settled claims including changes in our processes which might accelerate or slow down the development and or recording of paid or incurred claims  changes in the legal environment  the effects of inflation  changes in the mix of business  and the impact of large losses 
these factors are incorporated in the recommended reserve range from which management selects its best point estimate 
as at december   a change in the gross reserve for ibnr losses would have equated to a change of approximately million in loss reserves which would represent of net income before income tax for the twelve months ended december  as at december   a change in the gross reserve for ibnr losses would have equated to a change of approximately million in loss reserves which would represent of net income before income tax for the twelve months ended december  investments 
we currently classify all of our fixed maturity investments and short term investments as available for sale and  accordingly  they are carried at estimated fair value 
the fair value of fixed maturity securities is estimated using quoted market prices or dealer quotes 
for mortgage backed and other asset backed debt securities  fair value includes estimates regarding prepayment assumptions  which are based on current market conditions 
amortized cost in relation to these securities is calculated using a constant effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and estimated economic lives of the securities 
when actual prepayments differ significantly from anticipated prepayments  the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date 
changes in estimated yield are recorded on a retrospective basis  which result in future cash flows being used to determine current book value 
other investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting whereby the initial investment is recorded at cost 
the carrying amounts of these investments are increased or decreased to reflect our share of income or loss  which is included in net investment income  and are decreased for dividends 
other than temporary impairment in investments 
our process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors 
these primary factors include i the time period during which there has been a significant decline in value  ii an analysis of the liquidity  business prospects and financial condition of the issuer  iii the significance of the decline  iv an analysis of the collateral structure and other credit support  as applicable  of the securities in question  v expected future interest rate movements  and vi our intent 
table of contents and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time for the value to recover 
in addition  eitf requires that other than temporary impairments for certain asset backed and mortgage backed securities are recognized if the fair value of the security is less than its cost or amortized cost and there has been a decrease in the present value of the expected cash flows since the last reporting period 
where our analysis of the above factors results in our conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary  the cost of the security is written down to fair value and the previously unrealized loss is therefore considered realized in the period such determination is made 
deferred tax assets 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes and financial interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertain tax positions for our subsidiaries operating in income tax paying jurisdictions 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from the net tax effect of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our audited consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction 
at each balance sheet date  management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction and available tax planning strategies 
estimates of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions that may differ from actual experience 
differences in our assumptions and resulting estimates could be material and have an adverse impact on our financial results of operations and liquidity 
any such differences are recorded in the period in which they become known

gross premiums earned reflect the portion of gross written premiums which are recorded as revenues over the policy periods of the risks we write 
therefore  the earned premium recorded in any year includes premium from policies incepting in prior years and excludes premium to be earned subsequent to the balance sheet date

although our holdings in lehman brothers are in default  the market value for these securities was derived based on broker dealer prices quoted at december  management believes that this valuation is  in part  based on market expectations of future recoveries from lehman brothers bankruptcy proceedings 
in addition to our holdings in lehman brothers  we recognized provisions for other than temporary impairments of several other securities in our investment portfolio that were not in default at december  while such securities retained their investment grade ratings and timely continuation of interest and principal payments  they were priced at a significant discount to cost 
notwithstanding our intent and ability to hold these securities until maturity  and despite structures that indicate that a substantial amount of the securities should continue to perform in accordance with original terms  we could not assert that the recovery period would be temporary under the current accounting standards

operating and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in due primarily to million of reorganization costs associated with our us operations  in addition to the increase in operating and administrative expenses associated with personnel costs connected with increased bonuses and long term incentive charges

valuation of investments valuation of fixed income and short term available for sale investments 
all of the fixed income securities are traded in the over the counter market based on prices provided by one or more market makers in each security 
in addition  there are readily observable market value indicators such as credit spreads 
we use a variety of pricing sources to value our fixed income securities including those securities that have prepayment features such as mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities in order to ensure fair and accurate pricing 
the fair value estimates of the securities in our portfolio are not sensitive to significant unobservable inputs or modeling techniques 
valuation of other investments 
the value of our investments in funds of hedge funds is based upon monthly net asset values reported by the underlying funds to our funds of hedge fund managers 
the financial statements of our funds of hedge funds are subject to independent annual audits evaluating the net asset positions of the underlying investments 
we periodically review the performance of our funds of hedge funds and evaluate the reasonableness of the valuations 
other than temporary impairment 
we review all of our fixed maturities and short term investments for potential impairment each quarter based on criteria including issuer specific circumstances  credit ratings actions and general macro economic conditions 
the process of determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary requires considerable judgment 
as part of the assessment process we also evaluate our ability and intent to hold any fixed maturity security in an unrealized loss position until its market value recovers to amortized cost 
once a security has been identified as other than temporarily impaired  the amount of any impairment is determined by reference to that security s estimated fair value and recorded as a charge to realized losses included in earnings

reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses provision is made at the end of each year for the estimated cost of claims incurred but not settled at the balance sheet date  including the cost of ibnr claims 
the estimated cost of claims includes expenses to be incurred in settling claims and a deduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries 
estimated amounts recoverable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are calculated to arrive at a net claims reserve

gross reserves for the casualty reinsurance segment have continued to increase reflecting the build up of long tail reserves and the recognition of additional reserves associated with the global credit crisis 
international insurance reserves have increased by due to the recognition of hurricane related losses and the reserves associated with the new business lines 
the reserves for us insurance have increased reflecting hurricane losses and the higher proportion of casualty business 
prior year loss reserves 
in the twelve months ended december   and  there was an overall reduction of our estimate of the ultimate claims to be paid 
an analysis of this reduction by segment is as follows twelve months ended twelve months ended twelve months ended business segment december  december  december  in millions property reinsurance casualty reinsurance international insurance us insurance total reduction in prior year loss reserves for the twelve months ended december  the analysis of the development by each segment is as follows property reinsurance the million reserve release in this segment was predominantly due to favorable development on the catastrophe line of business 
the most significant elements related to reductions in loss estimates for the uk floods and estimated recoveries from enforcing subrogation rights in respect of california wildfires 

table of contents casualty reinsurance 
the million of reserve releases in our casualty reinsurance segment are mainly attributable to favorable development in our us casualty treaty and international casualty treaty reinsurance business which contributed million and million  respectively 
for both us and international casualty  where claims may take several years to emerge  the experience to date compared with starting loss ratios and expected patterns has generally been better than expected at the aggregate level 
additional releases occurred from commutations of certain contracts 
international insurance 
the international insurance segment has been impacted by million of net reserve strengthening during the reserve strengthening was attributable to deterioration in respect of a loss related to the california wildfires and also from shipowner s liability losses  both written in our marine and specialty liability account 
this was partially offset by favorable development in our uk commercial and property lines 
us insurance 
the million prior year release was due to better than expected experience primarily in the property line of business 
for the twelve months ended december  the analysis of the development by each segment is as follows property reinsurance 
property reinsurance deteriorated by million in  approximately million of which was attributable to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
the methodology used to determine the hurricanes ultimate losses was to review each cedant s position with respect to its reported claims and establish an expected ibnr utilizing information from that client 
in setting our loss estimates for hurricane katrina  we had taken account of evolving litigation relating to coverage and quantum issues and included additional provisions where appropriate 
because of ongoing litigation  there remains significant uncertainty as to our ultimate costs of hurricane katrina 
casualty reinsurance 
the lines contributing to the casualty reinsurance reserves release of million  were million attributed to international casualty  million to us casualty less million of reserve strengthening for casualty facultative and structured business 
although claims in these lines may take several years to emerge  the experience to date compared with our starting loss ratios and expected patterns have generally been better than expected at the aggregate level 
international insurance 
the international insurance reserves release was million  spread across several lines of which the largest contributor is uk commercial liability which accounted for million of releases 
this reduction was attributable mainly to a reduction in the uncertainty surrounding the initial case reserving methodology and continued favorable loss experience 
most other classes exhibited releases of between million and million with the exception of marine and specialty liability which deteriorated by million 
us insurance 
this segment had a million release driven largely by the casualty account 
this was due to the recognition of some favorable experience to date on the account 
for the twelve months ended december  the analysis of the development by each segment is as follows property reinsurance 
property reinsurance deteriorated by million in of which million was attributable to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
at year end we held a total ibnr for hurricane katrina for property reinsurance of million 
casualty reinsurance 
during  the most significant contributions to the casualty reinsurance reserves release of million  were million attributed to international casualty and million to us casualty 
claims in these lines may take several years to emerge 
nonetheless  the experience through december  compared with our starting loss ratios and expected patterns have been better than expected 
international insurance 
reserve releases of million for international insurance were spread across several lines of which the largest contributors being uk commercial liability of million  
table of contents specialty reinsurance of million  the run off of quota shares written in and of million followed by marine hull insurance of million and aviation insurance of million 
these releases were offset by increases in hurricane katrina reserves for the energy  liability and worldwide property accounts 
us insurance 
us insurance reserves were increased by million in due to the deterioration on the property account offsetting favorable development on the casualty account 
other than the matters described above  we did not make any significant changes in assumptions used in our reserving process 
however  because the period of time we have been in operation is relatively short  our loss experience is limited and reliable evidence of changes in trends of numbers of claims incurred  average settlement amounts  numbers of claims outstanding and average losses per claim will necessarily take years to develop 
capital management during  we continued to execute our capital management strategy to optimize our capital structure 
total capital decreased marginally during the year and the proportion funded by our ordinary shareholders has also reduced from to  mainly as a result of the million share repurchase in may the following table shows our capital structure at december  compared to december  as at as at december  december  in millions  except for percentages share capital  additional paid in capital and retained income and accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to ordinary shareholders preference shares liquidation preference  net of issue costs long term debt total capital management monitors the ratio of debt to total capital  with total capital being defined as shareholders equity plus outstanding debt 
at december   this ratio was  
our preference shares are classified in our balance sheet as equity but may receive a different treatment in some cases under the capital adequacy assessments made by certain rating agencies 
such securities are often referred to as hybrids as they have certain attributes of both debt and equity 
we also monitor the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital and this stands at as of december   
the principal capital management transactions during were as follows on february   the company s board authorized a new share repurchase program for up to million of ordinary equity 
the authorization covers the period through march  on may   we entered into a share purchase agreement with one of the company s founding shareholders  candover investments plc  its subsidiaries and funds under management and halifax ees trustees international limited  as trustees to a candover employee trust  to repurchase a total of  ordinary shares for a total purchase price of million 
the ordinary shares were purchased and cancelled on may  access to capital 
our business operations are in part dependent on our financial strength and the market s perception thereof  as measured by shareholders equity  which was  million at december   million 
we believe our financial strength provides us with the 
table of contents flexibility and capacity to obtain funds through debt or equity financing 
however  our continuing ability to access the capital markets is dependent on  among other things  market conditions  our operating results and our perceived financial strength 
we regularly monitor our capital and financial position  as well as investment and security market conditions  both in general and with respect to aspen holdings securities 
our ordinary shares and all our preference shares are listed on the new york stock exchange 
on december   we filed an unlimited shelf registration statement for the issuance and sale of securities from time to time 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short term and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
management monitors the liquidity of aspen holdings and of each of its insurance subsidiaries and arranges credit facilities to enhance short term liquidity resources on a stand by basis 
holding company 
we monitor the ability of aspen holdings to service debt  to finance dividend payments to ordinary and preference shareholders and to provide financial support to the insurance subsidiaries 
as at december  and  aspen holdings held million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents which  taken together with dividends declared or expected to be declared by subsidiary companies and our credit facilities  management considered sufficient to provide aspen holdings liquidity at such time 
during the period ended december   aspen bermuda and aspen uk holdings paid aspen holdings dividends of million and million  respectively 
in the twelve months ended december   aspen bermuda and aspen uk holdings paid aspen holdings a dividend of million and million respectively 
aspen holdings also received interest of million million from aspen uk holdings in respect of an inter company loan 
as a holding company  aspen holdings relies on dividends and other distributions from its insurance subsidiaries to provide cash flow to meet ongoing cash requirements  including any future debt service payments and other expenses  and to pay dividends  if any  to our preference and ordinary shareholders 
for a more detailed discussion of our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  see note of our financial statements 
insurance subsidiaries 
as of december   the insurance subsidiaries held approximately million million in cash and short term investments that are readily realizable securities 
management monitors the value  currency and duration of cash and investments held by its 
table of contents insurance subsidiaries to ensure that they are able to meet their insurance and other liabilities as they become due and was satisfied that there was a comfortable margin of liquidity as at december  and for the foreseeable future 
on an ongoing basis  our insurance subsidiaries sources of funds primarily consist of premiums written  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments 
cash is used primarily to pay reinsurance premiums  losses and loss adjustment expenses  brokerage commissions  general and administrative expenses  taxes  interest and dividends and to purchase new investments 
the potential for individual large claims and for accumulations of claims from single events means that substantial and unpredictable payments may need to be made within relatively short periods of time 
liquidity risks are managed by making regular forecasts of the timing and amount of expected cash outflows and ensuring that we maintain sufficient balances in cash and short term investments to meet these estimates 
notwithstanding this policy  if these cash flow forecasts are incorrect  we could be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity  potentially at a significant loss 
historically  we have not had to liquidate investments to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity 
the liquidity of the insurance subsidiaries is also affected by the terms of contractual obligations to us policyholders and by undertakings to certain regulatory authorities to facilitate the issue of letters of credit or maintain certain balances in trust funds for the benefit of policyholders

table of contents the facility can be used by any of the borrowers to provide funding for our insurance subsidiaries  to finance the working capital needs of the company and our subsidiaries and for general corporate purposes of the company and our subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility provides for a million sub facility for collateralized letters of credit 
the facility will expire on august  as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facilities  though we had million and million of outstanding collateralized and uncollateralized letters of credit  respectively 
the fees and interest rates on the loans and the fees on the letters of credit payable by the borrowers increase based on the consolidated leverage ratio of the company 
under the credit facilities  we must maintain at all times a consolidated tangible net worth of not less than approximately billion plus of consolidated net income and of aggregate net cash proceeds from the issuance by the company of its capital stock  each as accrued from january  on june   we amended the credit agreement to permit dividend payments on existing and future hybrid capital notwithstanding a default or an event of default under the credit agreement 
on april   the agreement was amended to remove any downward adjustment on maintaining the company s consolidated tangible net worth in the event of a net loss 
the company must also not permit its consolidated leverage ratio of total consolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth to exceed

contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations other than our obligations to employees  our perpetual piers and our perpetual preference shares under long term debt  operating leases and reserves relating to insurance and reinsurance contracts as of december  contractual basis payments due by period in millions less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations long term debt obligations reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses the long term debt obligations disclosed above does not include the million annual interest payable on our outstanding senior notes 
in estimating the time intervals into which payments of our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses fall  as set out above  we have utilized actuarially assessed payment patterns 
by the nature of the insurance and reinsurance contracts under which these liabilities are assumed  there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods shown and there could be a material acceleration or deceleration of claims payments depending on factors outside our control 
this uncertainty is heightened by the relatively short time in which we have operated  thereby providing limited company specific 
table of contents claims loss payment patterns 
the total amount of payments in respect of our reserves  as well as the timing of such payments  may differ materially from our current estimates for the reasons set out above under critical accounting policies reserves for losses and loss expenses 
we entered into an agreement in july to lease three floors comprising a total of approximately  square feet in hamilton  bermuda for our holding company and bermuda operations 
the term of the rental lease agreement is for six years  and we have agreed to pay approximately a total of million per year in rent for the three floors for the first three years 
we moved into these premises on january  beginning in  we will pay million in rent annually

we began paying the yearly basic rent of approximately million per annum in november the basic annual rent for each of the leases will each be subject to yearly upwards only rent reviews 
we also license office space within the lloyd s building on the basis of a renewable twelve month lease 
we also have entered into leases for office space in locations of our subsidiary operations 
these locations include boston  massachusetts  rocky hill  connecticut  alpharetta  georgia  scottsdale  arizona  pasadena  california  manhattan beach  california and atlanta  georgia in the us our international offices for our subsidiaries include locations in paris  zurich  singapore and dublin

off balance sheet arrangements ajax re is a variable interest entity under the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r 
we have a variable interest in the entity  however we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity and therefore we are not required to consolidate its results into our consolidated financial statements 
for further details on the ajax re transactions please see note to the audited financial statements for the twelve months ended december  included elsewhere in this report 
we are not party to any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an affiliated entity unconsolidated with us is a party  other than that noted above with ajax re  that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
ajax re provides us with california earthquake coverage based on modified industry losses  or indexed based losses  with an attachment level of billion and an exhaustion level of billion 
the indexed based losses are derived from industry personal lines losses  commercial lines losses and automobile losses  each as calculated by pcs 
we would recover up to million on a linear basis if we incurred losses in such earthquake 
the insurance cover expires on may  in order to ensure that ajax re had sufficient funding to service the libor portion of interest due on the bonds issued by ajax re  ajax re entered into a total return swap with lehman financing  whereby lehman financing directed ajax re to invest the proceeds from the bonds into permitted investments 
lehman brothers also provided a guarantee of lehman financing s obligations under the swap 

table of contents on september   lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy  which is a termination event under the swap 
ajax re terminated the swap on september  as a result  without the benefit of the total return swap  the extent of the actual reinsurance cover in the event of a california earthquake provided by ajax re will be limited to the market value of the collateral held by ajax re  that in light of current financial market conditions  we expect the market value of this collateral is substantially less than the million of original reinsurance cover 
nevertheless  we remain within our risk tolerances without the benefit of this reinsurance cover 
effects of inflation inflation may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations by its effect on interest rates and on the cost of settling claims 
the potential exists  after a catastrophe or other large property loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy as the demand for services such as construction typically surges 
we believe this had an impact on the cost of claims arising from the hurricanes 
the cost of settling claims may also be increased by global commodity price inflation 
we seek to take both these factors into account when setting reserves for any events where we think they may be material 
our calculation of reserves for losses and loss expenses in respect of casualty business includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
we write casualty business in the united states  the united kingdom and australia and certain other territories  where claims inflation has in many years run at higher rates than general inflation 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in earnings 
the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
in addition to general price inflation we are exposed to a persisting long term upwards trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages 
we seek to take this into account in our pricing and reserving of casualty business 
we also seek to take into account the projected impact of inflation on the likely actions of central banks in the setting of short term interest rates and consequent effects on the yields and prices of fixed interest securities 
as of february  we consider that although inflation is currently low  in the medium term there is a risk that inflation  interest rates and bond yields will rise with the result that the market value of certain of our fixed interest investments may reduce 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company believes that it is principally exposed to four types of market risk interest rate risk  equity risk  foreign currency risk and credit risk 
interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income securities 
accordingly  our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income portfolio falls  and the converse is also true 
we expect to manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity taking into account the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of aspen uk s  aspen bermuda s and aspen specialty s insurance and reinsurance liabilities 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk also includes maintaining a high quality portfolio with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
the portfolio is actively managed and trades are made to balance our exposure to interest rates 

table of contents as at december   our fixed income portfolio had an approximate duration of years 
the table below depicts interest rate change scenarios and the effect on our interest rate sensitive invested assets effect of changes in interest rates on portfolio given a parallel shift in the yield curve movement in rates in basis points in millions  except percentages market value gain loss percentage of portfolio corresponding percentage at december  equity risk 
we have invested in two funds of hedge funds which total in value million at december   equivalent to of the total of our investments  cash and cash equivalents at that date 
these funds of hedge funds are structured to have low volatility and limited correlation with traditional fixed income markets 
the underlying assets comprise investments in funds of hedge funds with diverse strategies and securities 
to the extent that the underlying hedge funds have equity positions and are market neutral  we are exposed to losses from changes in prices of those positions and to the extent that they have net long or net short equity positions  we are exposed to losses that are more correlated to changes in equity markets in general 
in february we gave notice to redeem our remaining investments in funds of hedge funds in  which would reduce our exposure to equity risk 
the earliest date at which these notices will take effect is june  and we will remain exposed to changes in the net asset value of the funds until at least that date 
foreign currency risk 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
the functional currencies of our segments are us dollars  british pounds  euros  swiss francs  australian dollars and singaporean dollars 
as of december   approximately of our cash and investments was held in us dollars  approximately were in british pounds and approximately were in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound 
for the twelve months ended december   of our gross premiums were written in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound and we expect that a similar proportion will be written in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound in other foreign currency amounts are remeasured to the appropriate functional currency and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are reflected in the statement of operations 
functional currency amounts of assets and liabilities are then translated into us dollars 
the unrealized gain or loss from this translation  net of tax  is recorded as part of ordinary shareholders equity 
the change in unrealized foreign currency translation gain or loss during the year  net of tax  is a component of comprehensive income 
both the remeasurement and translation are calculated using current exchange rates for the balance sheets and average exchange rates for the statement of operations 
we may experience exchange losses to the extent that our foreign currency exposure is not properly managed or otherwise hedged  which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
management estimates that a change in the exchange rate between british pounds and us dollars as at december   would have impacted reported net comprehensive income by approximately million million 
we will continue to manage our foreign currency risk by seeking to match our liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in these currencies 
this may involve the use of forward exchange contracts from time to time 
a forward foreign currency exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract 
foreign currency exchange contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time 
all realized gains and losses 
table of contents and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in the statement of operations 
as at december   the company held currency contracts to purchase million of us and foreign currencies nil 
credit risk 
we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories  business sectors and any one issuer 
as at december   the average rate of fixed income securities in our investment portfolio was aaa  compared to aa at december  in addition  we are exposed to the credit risk of our insurance and reinsurance brokers to whom we make claims payments for our policyholders  as well as to the credit risk of our reinsurers and retrocessionaires who assume business from us 
other than fully collateralized reinsurance  the substantial majority of our reinsurers have a rating of a excellent  the third highest of fifteen rating levels  or better by am best and the minimum rating of any of our material reinsurers is a excellent  the fourth highest of fifteen rating levels  by am best 
we have also entered into a credit insurance contract which  subject to its terms  insures us against losses due to the inability of one or more of our reinsurance counterparties to meet their financial obligations to the company 
payments are made on a quarterly basis throughout the period of the contract based on the aggregate limit  which was set initially at million but is subject to adjustment 
the table below shows our reinsurance recoverables as of december   and our reinsurers ratings taking into account any changes in ratings as of february  am best in millions a a a a fully collateralized not rated
