the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included in item of part ii of this form k 
overview vivus  inc is a biopharmaceutical company  incorporated in  dedicated to the development and commercialization of therapeutic products for large underserved markets 
our investigational drugs currently under development could serve the obesity  diabetes and sexual health markets 
our current and investigational drug candidates in development encompass patented proprietary formulations and novel delivery systems 
to date  through employment of this strategy  we have one fda approved drug and several investigational drug candidates in late stages of clinical development 
with respect to obesity  analysts estimate that this potential worldwide market could exceed billion annually 
sales of approved drugs for diabetes exceed billion 
the indications targeted by vivus investigational sexual health product candidates each represent a projected market greater than billion annually 
the current investigational drug pipeline includes three late stage clinical drug candidates  each addressing specific components of the obesity  diabetes and sexual health markets 
one of these investigational products  qnexa  is in phase clinical trials for obesity and has completed a phase clinical trial for diabetes 
another of our investigational drug candidates  avanafil  is in phase trials for erectile dysfunction 
all of the pivotal phase studies for qnexa for obesity were initiated in the fourth quarter of  are fully enrolled 
the first phase study  equate ob  was completed in late the co primary endpoints for these studies will evaluate the differences between treatments from baseline to the end of the treatment period  in mean percent weight loss and in the percentage of subjects achieving weight loss of or more 
all phase studies utilize our novel once a day formulation of 
table of contents qnexa  which at full strength contains mg phentermine immediate release and mg topiramate controlled release 
our late stage investigational drug candidate pipeline includes qnexa  being developed to treat obesity  for which two of the phase studies are ongoing and one phase study has been completed  qnexa  being developed to treat diabetes  for which a phase study has been completed  avanafil  being developed to treat erectile dysfunction  for which phase studies are ongoing  and luramist testosterone mdts  being developed to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women  for which a phase study has been completed 
in april  we entered into several agreements with deerfield management company  lp  or deerfield  a healthcare investment fund  and its affiliates  deerfield private design fund lp and deerfield private design international  lp collectively  the deerfield affiliates 
under the agreements  deerfield and its affiliates agreed to provide million in funding to the company 
the million in funding consists of million from a funding and royalty agreement  and million from the sale of our common stock under a securities purchase agreement 
we pay royalties on the current net sales of muse alprostadil and if approved  future sales of avanafil  an investigational product candidate  to the deerfield affiliates 
evamist  a metered dose transdermal estradiol spray approved for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause  was sold to k v pharmaceutical company  or k v  on may  for million in cash  which has all been received 
in  we launched muse in the united states and  together with our partners  internationally 
we market muse as a prescription product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
our future our goal is to build a successful pharmaceutical company through the development and commercialization of innovative proprietary products 
we intend to achieve this by capitalizing on our clinical and regulatory expertise and experience to advance the development of investigational drug candidates in our pipeline  establishing strategic relationships with marketing partners to maximize sales potential for our products that require significant commercial support  and licensing complementary clinical stage investigational drug candidates or technologies with competitive advantages from third parties for new and established markets 
it is our objective to become a leader in the development and commercialization of products for large underserved markets 
we believe we have strong intellectual property supporting several opportunities in obesity  diabetes and sexual health 
our future growth depends on our ability to further develop and obtain regulatory approval of our investigational drug candidates for indications that we are studying as well as for in licensing and product line extensions 
we have funded operations primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock  the sale of the rights to evamist and through product sales of muse 
we expect to generate future net losses due to increases in operating expenses as our various investigational drug candidates are advanced through the various stages of clinical development 
in connection with the sale of evamist  we received  to date  an aggregate of million 
the sale of evamist was a unique transaction 
as discussed in note sale of evamist product  an initial million was paid at closing and 
table of contents million was paid upon the fda s approval of the evamist nda 
these payments are non refundable and have been recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as license and other revenue ratably over a month period  from august  to may   which is the remaining term of a license to improvements to the metered dose transdermal spray  or mdts  applicator 
as compared to revenues from sales of muse  license and other revenue will be significant on a quarterly basis until all of the revenue from the sale of evamist is recognized  which is currently expected to be may since the million has been received and we have no related contingencies  the future recognition of revenue and the corresponding reduction of deferred revenue related to the evamist sale will have no impact on our cash flows from operations in future periods through may as of december   we have incurred a cumulative deficit of million and expect to incur operating losses in future years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to available for sale securities  product returns  rebates and sales reserves  research and development expenses  doubtful accounts  income taxes  inventories  contingencies and litigation and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition product revenue product sales are recognized as revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales allowances and reserves revenues from product sales are recorded net of product sales allowances for expected returns of expired product  government chargebacks and other rebate programs  and cash discounts for prompt payment 
these sales allowances are deducted from gross product revenues at the time such revenues are recognized along with the recording of a corresponding reserve  or liability 
in making these estimates we take into consideration our historical information  current contractual and statutory requirements  shelf life of our products  estimated customer inventory levels and information received from outside parties 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in estimating the reserve balances in any accounting period 
our product sales allowances and reserves include product returns we have estimated reserves for product returns from wholesalers  hospitals and pharmacies in the united states in accordance with our product returns policy 
our returns policy allows product returns within the period beginning six months prior to and twelve months following product expiration 
we sell one pharmaceutical product  muse  which is sold in four dosages and has a month shelf life 
as of december   the shipments of muse in the united states made in   and a portion of the shipments in remain subject to future returns 

table of contents the following table summarizes our product subject to return as of december  period of expiration estimated gross sales value in thousands from to  sep oct  jan nov  jan oct estimated gross sales value of product subject to return as of december  we record reserves for anticipated returns of expired product in the united states 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of product returns can be made based on historical experience 
there is no right of return on expired product sold internationally subsequent to shipment  thus  no returns reserve is needed 
we estimate our returns reserve by utilizing historical information and returns data obtained from external sources  along with the shelf life of the product 
we believe that the information obtained from external sources is reliable  but we are unable to independently verify the accuracy of such data 
we track the actual returns on a lot by lot basis along with date of production and date of expiration 
we review the actual returns experience for trends 
we calculate our returns reserve by applying an estimated return rate to the quantity of units sold that is subject to future return 
we routinely assess our experience with product returns and adjust the reserves accordingly 
revisions in returns estimates are charged to income in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known 
we consider a one percentage point variance in our returns rate to be a reasonably likely change in the percentage of our product returns to related gross sales 
a one percentage point change in the estimated product returns rate recognized on gross sales in would lead to an approximate  effect on our net sales and operating losses 
the following table summarizes the activity in the accounts related to accrued product returns in thousands balance at january current provision related to sales made in current period current provision related to sales made in prior periods actual product returns balance at december in the year ended december   we increased our returns rate from to based upon an increasing trend of product return experience 
at december   our returns rate was increased from to  again based upon an increasing trend of product returns 
the returns rate of has been used since december  the actual product returns included  in credit memos issued in  which were applied by customers in actual product returns can fluctuate between years due to both the timing of expiration and timing of when customers apply the credit memos that have been issued for returned product 
the product returns reserve at december   covering the estimated returns exposure for product shipped in  and a portion of  was estimated at million 
this product returns reserve calculation is based upon the most recent information available  and we believe is reasonable and adequate to cover the estimated future credit memos to be issued for the 
table of contents return of prior sales of muse 
quarterly  we will continue to monitor the product returns experience and make adjustments to the product returns reserve  as appropriate 
chargebacks chargebacks include government chargebacks which are contractual commitments by us to provide muse to federal government organizations including the veterans administration at specified prices and other rebate programs  primarily with medicaid  medicare part d and managed care organizations  for the reimbursement of portions of the prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs 
allowances for chargebacks are recorded at the time of sale to the wholesaler distributors and accrued as a reserve 
in estimating the chargeback reserve  we analyze actual government chargeback and rebate amounts paid and apply chargeback rates to estimates of the quantity of units subject to chargeback 
we estimate this reserve by utilizing historical information  contractual and statutory requirements  end customer prescription demand data  estimated quantities sold to these organizations and estimated wholesaler inventory levels based upon data obtained from our larger wholesaler customers which we began receiving in at that time  we determined the inventory data we had received from the larger wholesaler customers was more reliable than our previous estimates 
this change in estimated wholesaler inventory levels in resulted in a decrease in the chargeback provision of  related to prior period sales 
we believe that the information received from the wholesaler customers regarding inventory levels and information received from external sources regarding end customer prescription demand are reliable  but we are unable to independently verify the accuracy of such data 
effective january   muse no longer qualifies for medicaid reimbursement and effective january   muse no longer qualifies for medicare part d 
we routinely reassess the chargeback estimates and adjust the reserves accordingly 
we consider a two percentage point variance to be a reasonably likely change in the percentage of chargebacks to related gross sales 
a two percentage point change in the estimated chargebacks rate would lead to an approximate  effect on our net sales and operating losses in the following table summarizes the activity in the accounts related to accrued chargebacks in thousands balance at january current provision related to sales made in current period current provision related to sales made in prior periods actual chargebacks balance at december since  the increase in the provision for chargebacks is the result of a greater percentage of our sales volume attributable to government sales and the increased chargeback rates  negotiated discounts in government pricing  partially offset by the disqualification of medicaid or medicare part d reimbursements 
cash discounts we offer cash discounts to wholesaler distributors  generally of the sales price as an incentive for prompt payment 
the estimate of cash discounts is recorded at the time of sale 
we account for the cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts we expect wholesaler distributors to take 

table of contents the following table summarizes the activity in the accounts related to cash discounts in thousands balance at january current provision related to sales made in current period actual cash discounts balance at december all of the aforementioned categories of sales allowances are evaluated each reporting period and adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
changes in actual experience or changes in other qualitative factors could cause our sales allowance adjustments to fluctuate 
if actual returns  government chargebacks  rebates and cash discounts are greater than our estimates  additional reserves may be required which could have an adverse effect on financial results in the period of adjustment 
revisions to estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
license and other revenue we recognize license revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined in emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf in accordance with eitf  we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered element has stand alone value and we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each undelivered element 
if the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement cannot be objectively determined  revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements  or such elements are insignificant 
application of this standard requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the fair value of the individual elements and whether such elements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship 
revenue from non refundable  upfront license fees where we have continuing involvement is recognized ratably over the development or agreement period 
revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
on may   we closed our transaction with k v for the sale of our product candidate  evamist  a metered dose transdermal spray for the treatment of menopause symptoms 
at the time of the sale  evamist was an investigational product and was not yet approved by the fda for marketing 
the sale transaction contained multiple deliverables  including the delivery at closing of the evamist assets mainly raw material inventory and certain fixed assets  a grant of a sublicense of our rights under a license related to evamist  and a license to the mdts applicator  the delivery upon receipt of regulatory approval of evamist  along with all regulatory submissions  and  lastly  the delivery after fda approval of certain transition services and a license to improvements to the mdts applicator 
we received approval from the fda to market evamist on july   or fda approval  and on august   we transferred and assigned the evamist fda submissions  and all files related thereto to k v 
in august  the company assigned all of its rights and obligations under the evamist license agreement to k v 
we received an upfront payment of million in may upon the closing and received an additional million milestone payment in august upon fda approval 
these payments are non refundable 

table of contents we evaluated this multiple deliverable arrangement under eitf to determine whether the deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting 
upon fda approval  the two remaining deliverables are the transition services to be performed under the transition services agreement  or tsa  and a license to improvements to the mdts applicator  or improvement license  during the two year period commencing with the closing  or may   and ending on may  we are able to establish fair value for the tsa 
as it relates to the improvement license  no specific value was assigned in the agreement 
we have no obligation to develop improvements to the mdts applicator and have no plans to expend significant resources in this endeavor 
however  as required under eitf  we do not have objective  reliable evidence of fair value or evidence of inconsequential value to the customer of the improvement license 
accordingly  the delivered items  together with the undelivered items  are bundled together and are treated as one unit of accounting 
as a result  the initial million paid at closing and the million paid upon fda approval have been recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as license revenue  together with the future billings under the tsa  if any  ratably over the remaining month term of the improvement license  from august  to may  the revenue related to the transaction recognized in the year ended december  was million and for the year ended december  was million 
such revenue in future quarters is expected to be recognized as follows in thousands quarter ending license revenue march  june  we are also eligible to receive milestone payments of up to million based upon sales of evamist through the term of the agreements 
revenues associated with these performance milestones will be recognized when they are earned and collectability is reasonably assured 
in february  k v and certain of its subsidiaries announced a voluntary recall of most of its prescription products 
subsequent to the recall  k v announced plans to reduce its workforce by employees 
in january  k v voluntarily suspended the manufacturing and shipping of all of its products 
evamist is not manufactured by k v and was not subject to the recall 
given the uncertainties with k v  it is difficult to determine the extent of the adverse impact on evamist 
although we are entitled to additional milestone payments from future sales of evamist by k v  at the present time we do not anticipate receiving any additional milestones for the sales of evamist 
research and development expenses research and development  or r d  expenses include license fees  related compensation  consultants fees  facilities costs  administrative expenses related to r d activities and clinical trial costs at other companies and research institutions under agreements which are generally cancelable  among other related r d costs 
we also record accruals for estimated ongoing clinical trial costs 
clinical trial costs represent costs incurred by clinical research organizations  or cros  and clinical sites and include advertising for clinical trials and patient recruitment costs 
these costs are recorded as a component of r d expenses and are expensed as incurred 
under our agreements  progress payments are typically made to investigators  clinical sites and cros 
we analyze the progress of the clinical trials  including levels of patient enrollment  invoices received and contracted costs when evaluating the adequacy of accrued liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

table of contents accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to our customers for product sales resulting in accounts receivable 
customer accounts are monitored for past due amounts 
past due accounts receivable  determined to be uncollectible  are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based upon past due amounts  historical losses and existing economic factors  and are adjusted periodically 
the accounts receivable are reported on the consolidated balance sheet  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
see schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts table 
this summarizes the activity in the accounts related to allowance for doubtful accounts 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if it is not more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets  we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
as a result of our analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  as of december   it was considered more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets would not be realized 
as of december   we believed that the amount of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet would not ultimately be recovered 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we would recognize a benefit to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions  including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognizing  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the cumulative effect of adopting fin no 
on january  was recognized as a change in accounting principle  recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit on the adoption date 
as a result of the implementation of fin no 
 we recognized a decrease of approximately million in our income tax liability  which resulted in a decrease of million in accumulated deficit on january  
table of contents inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence  unmarketable or excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during the quarter ended september   we established significant reserves against our inventory to align with the then new estimates of expected future demand for muse 
as of december   the remaining inventory reserve balance is million relating to raw materials and components 
in the first quarter of  we determined that we likely would continue to use some portion of the fully reserved component parts inventory in production 
when we record inventory reserves  we establish a new  lower cost basis for the inventory for accounting purposes 
accordingly  to the extent that this fully reserved inventory was used in production in   and it was charged to cost of goods sold at a zero basis  which had a favorable impact on cost of goods sold 
cash and cash equivalents the company considers highly liquid investments with maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
all cash equivalents are invested in money market funds  corporate bonds and commercial paper 
these accounts are recorded at cost  which approximates fair value 
cash with restrictions for a period of greater than months is classified as restricted cash  a non current asset 
available for sale securities we focus on capital preservation and liquidity in our investments in available for sale securities 
through february   we restricted our investments to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate and asset backed securities  including commercial paper  rated a p f or better 
the weighted average maturity of our portfolio was not to exceed months 
on february   the audit committee of the board of directors approved a change to the investment policy to be more restrictive in the focus on capital preservation and liquidity in our investments in available for sale securities 
future cash investments are restricted to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate debt obligations rated aa aa or a p or better or asset backed commercial paper rated a p or better 
the weighted average maturity of our portfolio for new investments is not to exceed nine months 
we invest our excess cash balances in money market and marketable securities  primarily us treasury securities and debt securities of us government agencies  corporate debt securities and asset backed securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the investment policy has the primary investment objectives of preservation of principal while at the same time maximizing yields without 
table of contents significantly increasing risk  however  there may be times when certain of the securities in our portfolio will fall below the credit ratings required in the policy 
if those securities are downgraded or impaired we would experience losses in the value of our portfolio which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
also  if the banking system or the financial markets continue to deteriorate or remain volatile  our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected 
we determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date 
our marketable securities have been classified and accounted for as available for sale 
these securities are carried at fair value based on market prices obtained from a number of pricing methods used to derive the fair value of the securities on a recurring basis 
these fair values are obtained primarily from multiple third party pricing services 
we may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than months until maturity 
in response to changes in the availability of and the yield on alternative investments as well as liquidity requirements  we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities 
as these securities are viewed by us as available to support current operations  based on the provisions of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter a  working capital current assets and liabilities  securities with maturities beyond months are classified as current assets  except for certain securities that we expect to recover their full or substantial values beyond the next months due to the current lack of a readily available market  and the continued uncertainty in the capital markets 
consequently  we have classified those available for sale securities as non current in our consolidated balance sheet at december  securities are carried at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as a component of stockholders equity  unless the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary and we do not have the intent and ability to hold such securities until their full cost can be recovered  in which case such securities are written down to fair value and the loss is charged to other than temporary loss on impaired securities 
we evaluate our investment securities for other than temporary declines based on quantitative and qualitative factors 
any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined on a specific identification method  and such gains and losses are reflected as a component of interest income 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sab topic m  accounting for non current marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
a significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination of when an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
we follow a consistent and systematic process for recognizing impairments on securities that sustain other than temporary declines in value 
we have established a policy for the impairment review process 
the decision to impair a security incorporates both quantitative criteria and qualitative information 
the impairment review process considers a number of factors including  but not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than book value  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  iii our intent and ability to retain impaired investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value  iv whether the debtor is current on interest and principal payments and v general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors 
for securities that are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  the security is adjusted to fair value and the resulting losses are recognized in other than temporary loss on impaired securities in the consolidated statements of operations 
the new cost basis of the impaired securities is not increased for future recoveries in fair value 
during the company s year end impairment assessment  the company determined that a decline in value of certain securities was other than temporary 
accordingly  the company recorded other than temporary impairment adjustments of million in the year ended december  
table of contents the company included this non cash impairment charge in other than temporary loss on impaired securities in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income loss 
included in the charge taken in was million related to corporate bonds issued by lehman brothers holdings inc  or lehman or their respective subsidiaries  as appropriate 
on september   lehman filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
accordingly  recovery of the full value of our lehman bonds  if any  is deemed remote and we recognized an other than temporary impairment in the year ended december  in addition  other than temporary impairments recognized in included impairments on investments for which the company determined that the impairment was other than temporary due to credit downgrades and or the company s intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity 
these securities covered a number of industries 
if market  industry  and or investee conditions deteriorate  the company may incur further impairments 
in addition  due to the current lack of a readily available market for certain of the company s available for sale securities totaling million and the continued uncertainty in the capital markets  the company expects to recover the carrying values of these securities beyond the next months 
consequently  the company has classified those available for sale securities as non current in the consolidated balance sheets 
from and until december  we had an investment in columbia strategic cash portfolio  or strategic cash  offered by our investment advisor  columbia management llc  or columbia 
strategic cash is an enhanced money market fund in which the fund sought to maintain a per share net asset value 
we used strategic cash for the investment of excess cash  and periodic transfers were made from strategic cash to the operating cash account to fund our current operations 
in early december  we were notified by columbia that the strategic cash fund was closed and that the fund was to be liquidated 
the fund no longer supported the per share net asset value and switched to a market value fund in which all investments were marked to market 
we were given the option of staying in the fund and receiving cash proceeds from the fund as its holdings were liquidated or receiving a pro rata share of the investments held by the fund 
upon advice from our investment advisor  columbia  we took redemption in kind distribution consisting of cash  interest receivable and a pro rata distribution of the underlying securities  consisting principally of corporate debt and asset backed securities 
prior to the redemption our investment in strategic cash was million 
on december  and december   we received our redemption in kind distribution consisting of securities with a market value of million  interest receivable of  and cash of million 
the difference between our investment in strategic cash of million and the fair value of the securities  cash and interest receivable totaling million received in kind resulted in a loss of million 
this loss of million was reflected in interest income in the consolidated statement of operations and other comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  the securities distributed to us from strategic cash included corporate bonds  commercial paper  asset backed securities and other securities 
certain of the securities transferred to us from strategic cash  totaling million in fair value at transfer  did not comply with our investment policy in effect at that time due to either credit ratings  length of maturities or sectors not allowed under the policy 
these securities were approved by the audit committee of the board of directors for acceptance into our portfolio 
the securities received on redemption will be subject to changes in value depending on market conditions 
contingencies and litigation we are periodically involved in disputes and litigation related to a variety of matters 
when it is probable that we will experience a loss  and that loss is quantifiable  we record appropriate reserves 
we record legal fees and costs as an expense when incurred 

table of contents share based payments we follow the fair value method of accounting for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with the financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  r  share based payment  or sfas r 
we adopted sfas r effective january  using the modified prospective method of transition 
under sfas r  the estimated fair value of share based compensation  including stock options and restricted stock units granted under our stock option plan and purchases of common stock by employees at a discount to market price under the employee stock purchase plan  or the espp  is recognized as compensation expense 
compensation expense for purchases under the espp is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the common stock purchase rights during each offering period and the percentage of the purchase discount 
we recorded million  million and million of share based compensation expense for the years ended december    and  respectively 
share based compensation expense is allocated among cost of goods sold and manufacturing  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses based on the function of the related employee 
this charge had no impact on our cash flows for the periods presented 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the share based awards as of the grant date 
the black scholes model  by its design  is highly complex  and dependent upon key data inputs estimated by management 
the primary data inputs with the greatest degree of judgment are the estimated lives of the share based awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price 
the black scholes model is highly sensitive to changes in these two data inputs 
the expected term of the options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is derived by analyzing the historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
we determine expected volatility using the historical method  which is based on the daily historical trading data of our common stock over the expected term of the option 
management selected the historical method primarily because we have not identified a more reliable or appropriate method to predict future volatility

sfas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  except as it applies to the nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities subject to fsp adoption of the provisions of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position 
financial instruments measured at fair value 
our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale financial instruments are carried at fair value and we make estimates regarding valuation of these assets measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurement definition and hierarchy 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
valuation technique 
sfas no 
establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of vivus 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the 
table of contents assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
sfas no 
prescribes three valuation techniques that shall be used to measure fair value as follows market approach uses prices or other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flow amounts to a single present value amount discounted 
cost approach the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset ie  current replacement cost 
one or a combination of the approaches above can be used to calculate fair value  whichever results in the most representative fair value 
in addition to the three valuation techniques  sfas no 
prescribes a fair value hierarchy in order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures 
the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment 
these types of instruments primarily consist of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as cash  money market funds and us treasury securities that are actively traded 
management judgment was required to determine our policy that defines the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions is met for a market to be considered active 
level valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable  directly or indirectly 
quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
the types of instruments valued based on other observable inputs include debt securities of us government agencies  corporate bonds  mortgage backed and asset backed products 
substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace  can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
these types of instruments include certain corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities 
level is comprised of unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity 
these instruments are considered level when their fair values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flows or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable 
level may still include some observable inputs such as yield spreads derived from markets with limited activity 
level financial assets include securities for which there is limited market activity such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation 
at december   these securities were valued primarily using valuation models that incorporate transaction details such as contractual terms  maturity  timing and amount of future cash inflows  as well as assumptions  including but not limited to  about prepayment speeds  credit spreads  default rates and benchmark yields and liquidity 
the availability of observable inputs can vary from product to product and is affected by a wide variety of factors  including  for example  the type of product  whether the product is new and not yet 
table of contents established in the marketplace  and other characteristics particular to the transaction 
to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market  the determination of fair value requires more judgment 
accordingly  the degree of judgment exercised by us in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
fair value measurements as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis totaled million 
of these  approximately million were classified as level  million were classified as level  and approximately million as level approximately of our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities are cash  money market instruments and us treasury securities and these are classified as level the valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of these financial instruments were derived from quoted market prices  as substantially all of these instruments have maturity dates  if any  within one year from the date of purchase and active markets for these instruments exists 
approximately of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level were classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets 
when observable market prices for identical securities are not available  we price our marketable debt instruments using quoted market prices for similar instruments  or pricing models  such as a discounted cash flow model  with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data 
securities classified as level generally include debt securities of us government agencies  corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities 
when values are determined using inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the values of the instruments being measured  we classify those instruments as level under the sfas no 
hierarchy 
as of december   our investment securities classified as level totaled million or of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
during  we transferred approximately million of assets from level to level these assets primarily consisted of corporate bonds and asset backed securities that were transferred from level to level due to a greater availability of observable market data 
during  we experienced million in impairment losses related to the level assets in our portfolio 
deerfield financing on april   we entered into several agreements with deerfield management company  lp  or deerfield  a healthcare investment fund  and its affiliates  deerfield private design fund lp and deerfield private design international  lp collectively  the deerfield affiliates

 interest on receivables and payables  interest on the loan will be recognized over three years  which is the estimated term of the loan based on the earliest date that the deerfield affiliates could require us to repay the amounts advanced 

table of contents results of operations executive overview for the year ended december   we reported net loss of million  or net loss per share  as compared to net loss of million  or net loss per share during the same period in the increased net loss in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses related to our phase clinical trials of qnexa for the treatment of obesity and from the loss due to an other than temporary decline in the market value of certain investments  partially offset by the recognition of additional k v deferred license revenue in on april   we entered into several agreements with deerfield management company  lp  or deerfield  a healthcare investment fund  and its affiliates 
under the agreements  deerfield and its affiliates agreed to provide million in funding to us 
the million in funding consists of million from the fara  and million from the sale of the company s common stock at the closing on april  in connection with the registered direct offering mentioned above under a securities purchase agreement

the amounts of funding provided under the fara  net of certain amounts  represent a financial obligation  a loan payable by the company in which the principal and interest will be repaid through royalty payments and the exercise of the option or put rights 
in connection with the sale of evamist  we received million 
the sale of evamist was a unique transaction 
as discussed in note sale of evamist product  an initial million was paid at closing and million was paid upon fda approval of evamist 
these payments are non refundable and have been recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as license and other revenue ratably over a month period  from august  to may   which is the remaining term of a license to improvements to the mdts applicator 
as compared to revenues from product sales  license and other revenue will be significant on a quarterly basis until all of the revenue from the sale of evamist is recognized  currently expected to be may since the million has been received and we have no related contingencies  the future recognition of revenue and the corresponding reduction of deferred revenue related to the evamist sale will have no impact on our cash flows from operations in future periods through may the revenue related to the transaction recognized in the year ended december  was million and the revenue in future quarters is expected to be recognized as follows in thousands quarter ending license revenue march  june  with the exception of income generated from the revenue recognition of the million received from k v  we may have continued losses in future years  depending on the timing of our research and development expenditures  because we expect muse sales to remain consistent with prior years and we plan to continue to invest in clinical development of our current research and investigational product candidates to bring those potential products to market 

table of contents revenue change increase decrease years ended december  vs vs in thousands  except percentages united states product  net international product license and other revenue total revenues worldwide product revenues from the sales of muse were million in  a decrease of million  or  from the worldwide sales of muse in us product revenues decreased in as compared to the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in shipments of muse partially offset by a price increase for in  product revenue was higher due to an adjustment to our sales allowances for chargebacks of  the sales adjustment in was the result of updated information received from certain wholesaler customers of the inventory in the distribution channel 
domestic demand for muse at the retail and government level remains consistent with the prior period  averaging just under  units per quarter 
similar to prior years  in the fourth quarter  our largest wholesaler customer made purchases that were greater than current demand 
based upon fourth quarter demand for muse  we estimate purchases made by wholesaler customers in the fourth quarter represent approximately to months of excess demand 
in the fourth quarter and prior years  at least one other major wholesaler customer had also purchased quantities in excess of demand 
the decrease in international revenues in is mainly due to the timing of orders from our international distributors as well as adjustments to our sales allowance in the increase in license and other revenue is primarily due to the amortization of the k v deferred license revenue 
although the demand for muse has stabilized  we are not able to anticipate if our largest wholesaler customer will continue its historical pattern of making purchases in the fourth quarter that exceed expected quarterly demand 
if our largest wholesaler customer does not repeat this pattern of purchasing quantities of muse that exceed quarterly demands  revenues from the sale of muse in may be lower as compared to worldwide product revenues from the sales of muse were million in  an increase of million  or  from the worldwide sales of muse in product revenue in the united states for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million in the increase in domestic revenues in was mainly due to increases in both domestic prices and shipment volume 
the increase in international revenues in was mainly due to the timing of orders from our international distributors as well as adjustments to our sales allowance 
the increase in license and other revenue is primarily due to the amortization of the deferred license revenue earned due to the sale of evamist 
cost of goods sold and manufacturing change increase decrease years ended december  vs vs in thousands  except percentages cost of goods sold and manufacturing cost of goods sold and manufacturing  or cost of goods sold  in the year ended december  decreased  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of goods sold is primarily due to a one time charge of

in the year ended december   qnexa for obesity spending increased by million  avanafil spending increased by million and other project expenses increased on a net basis by  as compared to the prior year 
in addition  non project related expenses increased by million primarily attributable to million in increased compensation and related expense due to an increase in headcount  increased consulting expense of  increased non cash stock based compensation expense of  and a net increase in other non project related spending of 
in the years ended december  and  we spent million and million  respectively  for services provided by one clinical research organization on the qnexa phase studies  which represented and  respectively  of our total research and development expenses 
in the years ended december  and  we spent million and million  respectively  on clinical supplies and formulation work performed by our sole source manufacturer  which represented and  respectively  of our total research and development expenses 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses in will be similar to costs incurred in  as we continue to advance the clinical program for qnexa for the treatment of obesity  avanafil for erectile dysfunction and our other investigational products 
the current remaining contractual obligation for payments to our primary contract research organization  or cro  for the phase qnexa trials totals million and for payments to our primary cro for the phase avanafil trials totals million 
there are likely to be additional research and development expenses related to qnexa and our other investigational products under development 
our research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of our development activities and the results of clinical and preclinical studies 
regardless  if we are successful in obtaining fda regulatory approval for any new investigational product candidates being developed through our research and development efforts  we do not expect to recognize revenue from sales of such new products  if any  for several years due to the length of time required to develop investigational product candidates into commercially viable products 
research and development expenses in the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  this 
table of contents increase was primarily the result of a million net increase in project related spending including increased spending of million for qnexa partially offset by decreased spending of million for evamist and million for alista and a net increase of million in non project related spending primarily due to increases of  in stock based compensation expense and  in increased compensation and related expense due to an increase in headcount in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  evamist and alista clinical trial activities ended in and consequently  aside from the million milestone payment made to acrux in august for the approval of evamist  there was little spending on these projects in selling  general and administrative change increase years ended december  vs vs in thousands  except percentages selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december   increased million  or  to million as compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to incremental increases in corporate legal fees of million  primarily due to the acrux arbitration  sales distribution fees of  compensation expense of  investor relations expense of  a net decrease of million in muse advertising and sales promotion costs and other net selling  general and administrative expenses increases of  as compared to the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  of million increased million  or as compared to the year ended december  in the year ended december   the increase is primarily due to incremental increases in non cash stock based compensation expense of million  muse related sales and marketing expenses of  accrued compensation of  accounting  tax and audit fees of  due in part to the sale of evamist and other tax consultation  investor relations expenses of  resulting from the common stock offering in august  board of director fees of  and corporate legal fees of  as compared to the year ended december  we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses in will increase slightly compared to those in due to higher legal expenses relating to the acrux arbitration matter 
interest income and expense interest income  net for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income in the year ended december  as compared to the same period last year is primarily due to a decrease in our investment yields 
in  we recognized a realized loss of  related to the sale of securities 
interest income  net for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income was primarily due to the increase in our average investment cash balance due to the receipt of million from k v for the sale of evamist in for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in in addition  in the year ended december   we recognized a million realized loss on investments due to the redemption in kind distribution of our investment in the columbia strategic cash portfolio see note cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to  during the same period last year 
the net increase in interest expense in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is primarily due to interest expense on the deerfield financing 

table of contents interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  during the same period in interest expense in both years is primarily related to the crown note and the mitsubishi tanabe line of credit 
on april   in connection with the sale of evamist to k v  we paid in full the million outstanding balance on the mitsubishi tanabe line of credit  including all accrued interest and terminated the line of credit 
the other than temporary loss on impaired securities was million in the year ended december   which included a million loss related to our investment in corporate bonds issued by lehman brothers holdings inc  or lehman or their respective subsidiaries  as appropriate 
on september   lehman filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
accordingly  recovery of the full value of our lehman bonds  if any  is deemed remote and we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss in the third quarter of the million other than temporary loss primarily represents unrealized impairment losses recorded on securities that are classified as available for sale securities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the majority of the other than temporary losses on impaired securities were recorded on securities obtained in late through the redemption in kind distribution from the bank of america strategic cash portfolio 
with the current volatility and turmoil in the economy and financial markets there can be no assurance that additional impairment losses will not be recognized in future periods 
there were no other than temporary impairment losses in the years ended december  and provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was  as compared to million for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  relates to state income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in the amount of million for the year ended december  relates to the us amt  tax expense as a result of the excess tax benefits related to share based compensation plans the benefit of which is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as additional paid in capital and state income taxes 
the utilization of tax loss carryforwards is limited in the calculation of amt and as a result  a federal tax charge was recorded in the year ended december  this provision reflected tax recognition of the entire million in non refundable payments we received from k v in the year ended december  for the sale of evamist 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was  and was related to state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources cash 
unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million is the net result of cash provided by financing activities  partially offset by cash used for operating activities for the year ended december  included in these amounts are cash receipts from the sale of common stock and the deerfield financing  including million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and million from deerfield  as well as million from stock option exercises and  from the sale of common stock through our espp 
since inception  we have financed operations primarily from the issuance of equity securities 
through december   we raised million from financing activities  received million from the sale of evamist and had an accumulated deficit of million at december  
table of contents available for sale securities 
we focus on capital preservation and liquidity in our investments in available for sale securities 
through february   we restricted our investments to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate securities  including commercial paper  rated a p f or better 
the weighted average maturity of our portfolio was not to exceed months 
on february   the audit committee of the board of directors approved a change to the investment policy to be more restrictive in the focus on capital preservation and liquidity in our investments in available for sale securities 
future investments are restricted to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate debt obligations rated aa aa or a p or better or asset backed commercial paper rated a p or better 
the weighted average maturity of our portfolio for new investments is not to exceed nine months 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in available for sale securities 
we invest our excess cash balances in money market and marketable securities  primarily us treasury securities and debt securities of us government agencies  corporate debt securities and asset backed securities  in accordance with our investment policy 
the investment policy has the primary investment objectives of preservation of principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk  however  there may be times when certain of the securities in our portfolio will fall below the credit ratings required in the policy 
if those securities are downgraded or impaired  we would experience realized or unrealized losses in the value of our portfolio which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
also  if the banking system or the financial markets continue to deteriorate or remain volatile  our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected 
the current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets 
during the year ended december   we recorded unrealized charges for other than temporary impairment of securities of million 
we believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value 
however  over time  the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities  which could change our judgment regarding impairment 
this could result in realized losses relating to other than temporary declines being charged against future income 
given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved  there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material other than temporary impairments may be charged to income in future periods 
investment securities are exposed to various risks  such as interest rate  market and credit 
due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of investment securities  it is possible that changes in these risk factors in the near term could have an adverse material impact on our results of operations or shareholders equity 

table of contents based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on certain of these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan  however  these market risks associated with our investment portfolio could cause the loss of a significant portion of our investments which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
accounts receivable

as of february   we had collected of the accounts receivable outstanding at december  liabilities 
total liabilities were million at december   million lower than at december  the change in total liabilities includes a million decrease in deferred revenue primarily due to the amortization of the million in deferred license revenue received from k v on the sale of evamist  offset by a million increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments including a million milestone payment to mitsubishi tanabe following the enrollment in december of the first patient in the first phase clinical studies for avanafil  which was paid in january  a million increase in accrued research and clinical expenses primarily related to qnexa for obesity and a million increase in note payable due to borrowings under the fara

 or the registration statement  which was filed with the sec on july   to amend the registration statement to deregister any securities registered pursuant to the registration statement and not otherwise sold thereunder 
on august   we sold million of our common stock in a registered direct offering 
under the terms of the financing  we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
on august   the company filed a prospectus supplement with the sec relating to this registered direct offering under the existing shelf registration statement file number 
the funding necessary to execute our business strategies is subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of an investigational product candidate 
it is also important to note that if an investigational product candidate is identified  the further development of that candidate can be halted or abandoned at any time due to a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  funding constraints  lack of efficacy or safety or change in market demand 

table of contents the nature and efforts required to develop our investigational product candidates into commercially viable products include research to identify a clinical candidate  preclinical development  clinical testing  fda approval and commercialization 
this process is very costly and can take in excess of years to complete for each investigational product candidate 
the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of matters arising during the clinical studies  including  among others  the following we or the fda may suspend trials  we may discover that an investigational product candidate may cause harmful side effects or is not effective  patient recruitment may be slower than expected  and patients may drop out of the trials 
for each of our investigational product programs  we periodically assess the scientific progress and the merits of the programs to determine if continued research and development is economically viable 
certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and lack of prospects for ultimate commercialization 
as such  the ultimate timeline and costs to commercialize a product cannot be accurately estimated 
our investigational product candidates have not yet achieved fda regulatory approval  which is required before we can market them as therapeutic products 
in order to achieve regulatory approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish substantial evidence of safety and efficacy 
the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results in later clinical trials 
it is possible for a candidate to show promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently fail to establish safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  the duration and completion of our investigational product programs are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete our research and investigational product programs in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
we may also be required to make further substantial expenditures if unforeseen difficulties arise in other areas of our business 
in particular  our future capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress and costs of our research and development programs  the scope  timing and results of pre clinical testing and clinical trials  patient recruitment and enrollment in current and future clinical trials  the costs involved in seeking regulatory approvals for our investigational product candidates  the costs involved in filing and pursuing patent applications and enforcing patent claims  the establishment of collaborations  sublicenses and strategic alliances  the cost of manufacturing and commercialization activities and arrangements  the results of operations  demand for muse  
table of contents the potential forced purchase of the royalty streams we previously sold to deerfield  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the rate of technological advances  ongoing determinations of the potential commercial success of our products under development  the state of the economy and financing environment  the level of resources devoted to sales and marketing capabilities  and the activities of competitors 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources combined with anticipated future cash flows will be sufficient to support our operating needs at least through the end of however  we anticipate that we may require additional funding to continue our research and investigational product development programs  to conduct preclinical studies and trials  for operating expenses  to pursue regulatory approvals for our investigational product candidates  for the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending our patent claims  if any  and we may require additional funding to establish additional manufacturing and marketing capabilities in the future 
in particular  we expect to make other substantial payments to acrux and mitsubishi tanabe  in accordance with our agreements with them in connection with the licensing of certain compounds 
these payments are based on certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
in addition  we are required to make royalty payments on any future product sales 
similar to the transaction with evamist  we may consider selling or licensing any of our products in development or our commercial product in order to raise additional funding 
we may seek to access the public or private equity markets at any time 
the sale of additional equity securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances and other financing mechanisms 
we cannot assure you that adequate funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly one or more of our investigational product development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others 
this may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or investigational product candidates 
to the extent that we are unable to obtain third party funding for such expenses  we expect that increased expenses may result in future losses from operations 
we are continually evaluating our existing portfolio and we may choose to divest or spin off one or more of our products or investigational product candidates at any time 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop our products under development or that our products  if approved for sale  will generate revenues sufficient to enable us to earn a profit

the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  the company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that reduces its exposure and enables the company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
the company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position  or fsp  sfas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
fsp sfas clarifies the application of sfas no 
in a market that is not active and addresses application issues such as the use of internal assumptions when relevant observable data does not exist  the use of observable market information when the market is not active and the use of market quotes when assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data 
fsp sfas is effective for all periods presented in accordance with sfas no 
the guidance in fsp sfas is effective immediately and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption 
see note cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities for information and related disclosures regarding our fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fsp sfas  which delays the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis items that are remeasured at least annually 
the fsp deferred the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities until our fiscal year beginning on january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  or sfas r 
sfas r changes several underlying principles in applying the purchase method of accounting 
among the significant changes  sfas r requires a redefining of the measurement date of a business combination  expensing direct transaction costs as incurred  capitalizing in process research and development costs as an intangible asset and recording a liability for contingent consideration at the measurement date with subsequent re measurements recorded in the results of operations 
sfas r also requires that costs for business restructuring and exit activities related to the acquired company will be included in the post combination financial results of operations and also provides new guidance for the recognition and measurement of contingent assets and liabilities in a business combination 
in addition  sfas r requires several new disclosures  including the reasons for the business combination  the factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill  the amount of acquisition related third party expenses incurred  the nature and amount of contingent consideration  and a discussion of pre existing relationships between the parties 
on january   we adopted this statement  which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for collaborative agreements  or eitf eitf defines collaborative agreements as contractual arrangements that involve a joint operating activity 
these arrangements involve two or more parties who are both active participants in the activity and that are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activity 
eitf provides that a company should report the effects of adoption as a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all periods and requires additional disclosures about a company s collaborative arrangements 
on january   we adopted this statement  which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf  which requires nonrefundable advance payments for future r d activities to be capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or services are performed 
earlier application is not permitted 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
on january   we adopted this statement  which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this statement provides entities the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  management did not elect to measure any additional assets or liabilities at fair value that are not already measured at fair value under existing standards 
therefore  the adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
dividend policy we have not paid any dividends since our inception and do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
declaration or payment of future dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  operating results and current and anticipated cash needs 
cautionary note on forward looking statements our business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to  the risks inherent in our research and development activities  including the successful completion of clinical trials  the lengthy  expensive and uncertain process of seeking regulatory approvals  uncertainties associated both with the potential infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties  and with obtaining and enforcing our own patents and patent rights  uncertainties regarding government reforms and of product pricing and reimbursement levels  technological change  competition  manufacturing uncertainties and dependence on third parties 
even if our investigational product candidates appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for numerous reasons 
such reasons include the possibilities that the product will be ineffective or unsafe during clinical trials  will fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  will be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  will be uneconomical to market or will be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties 
for more information about the risks we face  see item a risk factors included in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities and exchange commission s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk based on changes in u 
s 
interest rates 
we do not have any material foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 

table of contents interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in widely diversified investments consisting of investment grade securities 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  by approximately  to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities 
we hold investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments  and both carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in market conditions and in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which may have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we have investments in us treasury securities and debt securities of us government agencies  corporate bonds  asset backed securities  and other securities

we presently do not need to access these funds for operating purposes 
we have the ability to generally hold our investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
in the event we need to access these funds  we may not be able to do so without a loss of principal 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk on the million loan payable to crown bank  na as of december  the loan is payable over a year term 
the interest rate is adjusted annually to a fixed rate for the year equal to the prime rate plus  with a floor of
