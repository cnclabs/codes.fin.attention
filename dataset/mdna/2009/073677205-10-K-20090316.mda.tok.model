overview we completed the move to the tyngsboro facility in january  and we have completed the first phase build out of our manufacturing facility 
we now have a facility capable of producing up to flywheels per year 
we have a second phase manufacturing build out planned which will increase the annual manufacturing capacity to more than  flywheels 
on november   we began to provide mw of frequency regulation service through the iso ne pilot program 
our mw system has been performing with more than average availability since january   and is earning revenue from frequency regulation services 
the revenue we have earned so far is lower than originally anticipated due to the type of signal being transmitted to us by the iso  which does not optimize our fast response capability and so results in lower mileage payments than expected 
we are working with iso ne to send a regulation signal that would utilize our technology s fast response capability  which would not only maximize benefits to the grid  but would also increase our mileage revenue 
the control signaling employed by the new york and california isos to operate our flywheels in our technology demonstration programs operated the systems at multiple levels over their entire performance range 
this control method required the flywheels to respond proportionally to variable imbalances between electricity supply and demand 
in contrast  iso new england has been operating beacon s system using a non proportional  trinary signal 
the trinary control method requires the system to be in one of three states either fully charging  neutral  or fully discharging 
we have found that the trinary method of operation does not fully utilize the performance capabilities of the flywheel system  and it causes the flywheels to operate at a higher temperature than the proportional control method 
to compensate for iso new england s current control method  the mw system has occasionally been operated at a slightly lower overall output  pending a refinement of the motor generator design 
during the first quarter of  initial testing on the redesigned motor rotor was favorable  and is now being implemented 
additionally  under the current market rules  we are not eligible for opportunity cost payments 
such payments comprise approximately one third of the revenue received by conventional regulating generators 
opportunity cost payments are provided to conventional regulating generators to compensate them for lost revenue as a consequence of providing regulation rather than conventional power generation 
we are working with iso ne to develop permanent market rules that would provide an additional payment component that will be approximately equal to opportunity cost 
the trend at other isos has been to incorporate features in their tariffs that intrinsically compensate energy storage providers for opportunity cost 
additionally  our operational costs for the pilot program are higher than expected for future implementations 
our connection to the grid was made through national grid distribution lines  rather than directly to the iso through transmission lines  due to cost and time factors 
consequently  we have had to pay retail rates for the energy we take off the grid and store on our flywheel system  but we are paid at wholesale rates when that same energy is returned to the grid 
national grid and iso ne have agreed to change the metering to net metering which should significantly reduce our costs going forward 
we have also incurred higher labor costs related to monitoring the system  especially during the initial weeks 
those costs are also expected to decrease as we and the iso gain experience with the system and make minor changes that allow it to respond better to the iso s control signal 
however  although our cost of energy and other operating costs are expected to decrease  we still do not expect to be able to operate profitably in the iso ne region until the revenue factors discussed earlier are addressed 
our business plan was to deploy up to mw in iso ne under its alternative technologies pilot program 
due to uncertainty and volatility in the equity markets  we modified our business plan during the fourth quarter of to ensure sufficient cash reserves into the first quarter of this combined with delays in utility interconnection work as a result of severe winter weather and the analysis and refinement of the motor generator  resulted in a reduction in the number of megawatts we deployed in iso ne by the end of to one mw 
due to the economics of the northeastern market  several megawatts of capacity originally planned for the iso new england pilot program will instead be deployed to our site in stephentown  new york  and to a second site in the pjm interconnection 
this will allow us to gain bidding and operations experience in two additional regulation markets and broader visibility as a regulation service provider 
the new york system will be interconnected to nyseg  a major state utility with which we have already entered into an interconnection agreement 
the new york iso is expected to open the market for energy storage based regulation services by mid on february   we announced that we had signed a contract with american electric power aep and one of its operating subsidiaries  columbus southern power company  to build a mw smart energy matrix installation at an aep site in groveport  ohio 
the system  which will be connected to the grid within the operating region of the pjm interconnection pjm  will provide commercial revenue from the provision of frequency regulation services 
aep will provide the site and certain integration services in support of the project  and have an opportunity to gain in depth knowledge about the performance of our system and its impact on frequency regulation and grid stability 
the agreement calls for us to deliver  install  test and operate  at our expense  a mw smart energy matrix 
aep will provide and or install materials and services needed to interconnect our system to pjm  including the foundation  electrical transformer  associated wiring and connection to power lines 
aep has already completed the necessary system impact study and executed an interconnection agreement 
installation of the smart energy matrix is scheduled to begin in mid year we need to obtain additional cash during to to fund our continuation as a going concern ongoing refinements of the smart energy flywheel and the smart energy matrix system the ramp up of our manufacturing and assembly capacity the manufacture of flywheels and build out of installations to provide frequency regulation services to the electricity grid working capital requirements the identification and development of new business opportunities 
by the end of  we expect to have a total of mw of capacity in service  between the tyngsboro  stephentown and ohio sites 
although we have sufficient cash to fund operations through the second quarter  we estimate that we will need to raise approximately million during to fund our business plan and have sufficient working capital to continue to order long lead items needed for our production plan 
we could deploy frequency regulations systems faster than contemplated by our current plan should additional funding become available  eg  through the doe loan guarantee program or otherwise 
as part of our new business development  we may evaluate possible acquisitions of enterprises or technologies that we would consider synergistic from a market  technology or product perspective 
from inception through december   we have incurred losses of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur losses as we expand our product development and begin to increase our manufacturing capacity 
revenue our revenue during came from three sources fixed price research and development contracts from government agencies  for which revenue has been recognized using the percentage of completion method sales of inverters and accessories frequency regulation service revenue from the iso ne pilot program which began on november  our business plan anticipates earning revenue primarily from the provision of frequency regulation service and potentially from the sale of our smart energy flywheel systems 
however  in the past  we have earned revenue from research and development contracts with government agencies  and we continue to pursue similar contracts 
in we derived approximately of our revenue from our research and development contracts  two of those contracts accounted for of our total revenue 
in  since most of our development contracts were completed in  our revenue was substantially less than in  and less than of our revenue was derived from our research and development contracts 
in addition  we have a small inventory of inverters and accessories that we sell  although that revenue is insignificant 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold on fixed price research and development contracts are predominantly being recorded on the percentage of completion method and consist primarily of direct labor and material  subcontracting and associated overhead costs 
cost of goods sold for frequency regulation services consists of the cost of energy 
cost of goods sold does not reflect the true cost of any inverter sales  because our inverter inventory was fully written off during a prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for sales and marketing personnel and related business development expenses 
sales and marketing expenses have increased as we have expanded our regulatory activity aimed towards the modification of market rules to facilitate our participation in the regulation services market 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits related to our corporate staff  professional fees  insurance and travel 
in  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately over the same period in  primarily due to increased legal and professional fees associated with regulatory activity and continued work on the doe loan program  higher compensation costs due in part to the hiring of a director of regulatory and market affairs and a director of human resources and higher equity based compensation costs  and increased use of subcontractors and consultants 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for were approximately lower than during the same period during  due primarily to a reduction in public company expenses  reduced use of subcontractors and consultants  lower stock compensation expense as a result of fewer new hire option grants and a lower black scholes fair value for options issued during the early portions of the fiscal year and allocation of a portion of our general and administrative expenses to our government contracts 
these reductions in cost were partially offset by slight increases in salaries and benefits resulting from new hires 
overall  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses fo fiscal to be lower than in primarily due to lower legal costs and other planned cost reductions 
research and development our cost of research and development includes the cost of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead since our flywheel production department is not yet running at full capacity  the cost of compensation and benefits for research and development staff  as well as materials and supplies used in the engineering design and development process 
in  we began development efforts on our smart energy flywheel system 
in  we substantially completed development of the smart energy matrix and began limited production of commercial units and building our first frequency regulation installations 
research and development costs have increased considerably from through our research and development costs during were approximately higher than during the same period in  due to legal and professional fees associated with the arete litigation  higher material costs  higher salary and benefit costs related to headcount increases to support engineering development and testing as well as manufacturing  higher facility costs and moving expenses and increased use of consultants and contractors 
in  we worked to develop at least two suppliers capable of producing each component of the smart energy matrix and  consequently  we incurred substantial tooling and material costs  some of which was paid on a best efforts basis to suppliers who have not yet been able to meet our specifications 
these costs were expensed 
we also expensed approximately  for material  outside contractors  labor  overhead and interest related to the construction of the non fungible portions of the system outside our tyngsboro location for the iso ne pilot program 
we expect research and development expenses in to be lower than in due to lower legal costs  along with lower expense material and subcontractor costs 
loss on contract commitments in  we completed all but one of our existing contracts at a lower cost than had been previously expected  and recorded a credit against previously recognized contract losses of approximately  in april  we were awarded a subcontract to provide a flywheel energy storage system in support of a wind integration research and development project in tehachapi  california  sponsored by the california energy commission 
we will receive approximately  to offset r d expenses and will contribute an additional  of engineering resources for the project  bringing the r d total to approximately  accordingly  we recorded a charge of approximately  to the contract loss reserve during to reflect the expected cost share portion of the tehachapi contract 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization is primarily related to depreciation on capital expenditures and the amortization of lease and leasehold costs related to our facilities 
depreciation expense will increase substantially in future periods as we build and deploy our frequency regulation installations 
interest and other income expense  net in  and  non operating income consisted primarily of interest income resulting from cash on hand 
approximately   and  were received in  and  respectively  in settlement of a class action suit relating to unfair practices engaged in by certain insurance brokerage firms 
a loss of approximately and a gain of approximately  related to the sales of fixed assets were recognized in and  respectively 
interest expense in related to the massdev loan 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates our estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  asset impairments  inventory valuation  warranty reserves and other assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition although we have shipped products and recorded contract and frequency regulation service revenues  our operations have not yet reached a level that would qualify us to emerge from the development stage 
therefore we continue to be accounted for as a development stage company under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by development stage enterprises 
product sales we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
generally  revenue is recognized on transfer of title  typically when products are shipped  and all related costs are estimable 
for sales to distributors  we make an adjustment to defer revenue until products are subsequently sold by distributors to their customers 
frequency regulation service revenue revenue from service transactions is recognized when it has been earned and is realized or realizable 
revenue from services is earned either as the services are performed or when they are complete  and is considered realizable once the customer has committed to pay for the services and the customer s ability to pay is not in doubt 
frequency regulation service revenue is calculated on an hourly basis  as services are provided  based on formulas specific to the tariffs in effect at the applicable iso at bid award rates that are published by the iso 
frequency regulation service revenue is calculated using the applicable rates and formulas as services are provided  and reconciled to amounts calculated and reported by the applicable iso 
if there are substantial variances between the revenue amounts we calculate and those reported by the iso  recognition of the discrepant amounts may be deferred until the variances have been investigated and agreement reached between us and the iso as to the correct revenue amount 
if the variances are not significant  we recognize the amounts reported by the iso 
government contract revenue recognized on the percentage of completion method we recognize contract revenues using the percentage of completion method 
we use labor hours as the basis for the percentage of completion calculation  which is measured principally by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total labor hours for each contract at completion 
changes to total estimated contract costs or losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed are classified as current assets  and included in unbilled costs on contracts in process in our balance sheets 
amounts billed to clients in excess of revenues recognized to date are classified as current liabilities under advance billings on contracts 
changes in project performance and conditions  estimated profitability  and final contract settlements may result in future revisions to construction contract costs and revenue 
all of our research and development contracts are subject to cost review by the respective contracting agencies 
our reported results from these contracts could change adversely as a result of these reviews 
loss on contract commitments our contracts have been primarily for the development of demonstration units of new products or the design of a frequency regulation facility 
as such  the work has supported our core research and development efforts 
we establish reserves for anticipated losses on contract commitments if  based on our cost estimates to complete the commitment  we determine that the cost to complete the contract will exceed the total expected contract revenue 
most of our contracts have been granted on a cost share basis  for which the expected cost share is recorded as a contract loss 
additionally  each quarter we perform an evaluation of expected costs to complete our in progress contracts and adjust the contract loss reserve accordingly 
inverter inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of actual cost or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
we have a limited amount of inventory related to our inverter product line  for which reserves were recorded in prior years 
these impairment charges were made due to the uncertainty of realizing any future value from the inventory due to the lack of substantial revenues to date from our inverter product line 
accordingly  for the years ended december   and  the value of our inverter product line inventory was fully offset by these reserves 
patent costs we capitalize external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents where we believe it is likely that the patent has a future economic value to us 
we monitor the legal costs incurred and the anticipated outcome of the legal action and  if changes in the anticipated outcome occur  capitalized costs will be adjusted in the period the change is determined 
patent costs are amortized over the remaining life of the patents 
we own intellectual property in the form of patents on our flywheel vacuum system  our heat pipe cooling systems  direct current output paralleling  metal hub  low loss motor  co mingled rims and earthquake tolerant bearings on our flywheel products  and anti islanding software  drawings  source code  and production know how on our inverter products  and expect to obtain other patents during and beyond 
in december  we recorded impairment charges to write down our capitalized patent costs to zero  due to the lack of substantial revenues to date and the uncertainty of realizing any future value from these patents 
accordingly  all costs incurred since related to the development of intellectual property were expensed as incurred 
however  as we have now begun to commercialize our technology  going forward legal costs associated with obtaining patents which we expect to have future commercial value will be capitalized and amortized over the life of the patent 
we review our intangible assets periodically for impairment  and record impairment reserves as appropriate 
warranty reserves the solar inverters we have sold carry warranties that require us to repair or replace defective products returned to us during the applicable warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs based on actual historical return rates  anticipated return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
should we sell our smart energy matrix systems in the future  it is likely that the terms of sale will include a warranty 
in that event  we will estimate the repair costs under the terms of the warranty  and record an initial provision for warranty costs that we will adjust periodically based on actual results and anticipated future costs at that time 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reduce our current valuation allowance which could materially impact our tax provision 
we classify interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
property and equipment property and equipment in service is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
property and equipment are defined as tangible items with unit costs exceeding our capitalization threshold that are used in the operation of the business  are not intended for resale and which have a useful life of one year or more 
the cost of fixed assets is defined as the purchase price of the item  as well as all of the costs necessary to bring it to the condition and location necessary for its intended use 
these costs include labor  overhead  capitalized interest and  if applicable  exit costs 
exit costs for which we are obligated are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
no overhead is generally applied for internally constructed projects not directly related to our core business eg  leasehold improvements 
repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
materials used in our development efforts are considered research and development materials  and are expensed as incurred in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for research and development costs 
capital assets are classified as construction in progress cip when initially acquired  and reclassified to the appropriate asset account when placed into service  with the exception of land  which is capitalized upon purchase 
depreciation expense is not recorded on assets not yet placed into service 
materials purchased to build flywheels  power electronics and other components used in our frequency regulation installations are classified as cip  along with the related labor and overhead costs 
some components of the smart energy matrix  such as the flywheels and power electronics  are considered fungible in that they can be moved and redeployed at a different location 
other costs are sunk costs which would not be recovered if we redeployed the matrix or portions thereof 
in some cases  we may elect to deploy a smart energy matrix system at a location for the purpose of demonstrating our technology or gaining experience operating in that particular market 
in these instances  the costs of the fungible components are capitalized  and the remaining costs  which may include such costs as site preparation  interconnection costs  capitalized interest and estimated exit costs  are expensed 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the conditions to be considered include whether or not the asset is in service  has become obsolete  is damaged  or whether external market circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when appropriate  we recognize a loss for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and the carrying amount  or the cost to repair the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using either available market prices or estimated discounted cash flows 
in certain instances  we may determine that it is in the best interest of the company to re deploy all or part of a smart energy matrix system installed at a given location 
when such a determination has been made  we will determine which costs are associated with the movable fungible components  and which costs are non fungible 
we will record a period expense for the net book value not associated with the fungible components 
based on our annual analysis  no asset impairment charges were considered necessary for or certain long lived assets were damaged in december and we recognized an asset impairment charge of approximately  in other assets and deferred financing costs we will defer our direct costs incurred to raise capital or to acquire an entity in a business combination 
direct costs include only out of pocket or incremental costs directly related to the effort  such as a finder s fee and fees paid to outside consultants for accounting  legal or engineering investigations or for appraisals 
these costs will be capitalized if the efforts are successful  or expensed when unsuccessful 
indirect costs are expensed as incurred 
advance billings on contracts we may receive performance based payments and progress payments from customers which may exceed costs incurred on certain contracts  including contracts with agencies of the us government 
such advances are classified as current liabilities

results of operations comparison of year ended december  and twelve months ended december  change change in thousands revenue cost of goods sold gross margin selling  general and administrative research and development loss on contract commitments depreciation and amortization casualty loss recovery interest and other income expense  net net loss revenue the following table provides details of our revenues for the twelve months ended december  and twelve months ended december  cumulative contract value earned as of percent complete total contract value remaining value backlog dollars in thousands cec nyserda pon nyserda pon air force research laboratory sandia doe earmark tehachapi total contract revenue frequency regulation revenue m and accessories total in  we focused on completing development of the smart energy matrix  manufacturing our initial commercial flywheels  and building our first frequency regulation facility in tyngsboro aimed at entering the iso ne pilot program in november we earned approximately  in revenue from the pilot program during this amount is not representative of the amounts we expect to earn going forward  due to a number of factors 
most of our research and development contacts were completed in consequently  contract revenue dropped from approximately  in to  in in addition  we recorded revenue of approximately  from the sale of smart power m inverter systems and related products  compared to approximately  in in  we expect both frequency regulation and contract revenue to increase  due to the deployment of additional capacity of frequency regulation and the navy contract awarded early in cost of goods sold cost of goods sold decreased from approximately  in to approximately  in cost of goods sold represents approximately  for research and development contracts calculated on the percentage of completion method 
year over year  the reduction in cost of sales associated with contracts was proportional to our reduction in contract revenue 
cost of goods sold also includes approximately  for the cost of energy associated with the generation of frequency regulation revenue under the iso ne pilot program 
cost of energy exceeded revenue from frequency regulation because of the manner in which we were connected to the grid for the pilot program  which resulted in our being paid for energy we provided to the grid at wholesale rates  but we were billed for the energy we used at retail rates 
we have reached an agreement with iso ne and our service provider to change the metering to a net meter through iso ne during  which we expect will reduce our energy costs in however  total energy costs for will be higher than in since the energy costs for represent the cost related to mw of capacity for a only six week period 
in  we expect to be providing more frequency regulation service capacity over a longer period of time than occurred in selling  general and administrative expenses twelve months ended december  comment in thousands period ended december   increases decreases legal and professional increase due primarily to regulatory efforts and costs associated with the doe loan and massdev loan programs 
salaries and benefits increase due to increased headcount  specifically in the regulatory and human resource areas  and increased cost of benefits such as health insurance 
subcontractors and consultants increased use of consultants for regulatory efforts associated with market rule changes and site selection for frequency regulation facilities 
twelve months ended december  comment in thousands allocation of overhead to contracts only one contract has allowed us to charge general and administrative overhead  and that contract was completed in since overhead allocated to contracts appears as a credit to the selling  general and administrative expense sg a  the loss of this credit results in an increase in sg a expense 
stock compensation expense decrease due to reversal of stock compensation related to officer performance based rsu grant for which management no longer believes it is probable that the performance requirements will be met 
other other includes general business expenses that were generally higher due to increased activity 
period ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses totaled approximately  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  which represents an increase of approximately  or  year over year 
significant changes in spending are explained in the table shown above 
overall  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal to be lower than in primarily due to lower legal costs and other planned cost reductions 
research and development expenses twelve months ended december  comment in thousands period ended december   increases decreases expense materials includes tooling and other non recurring expenses associated with qualifying suppliers for production  including write offs for best effort attempts and the cost of some non conforming product we received from suppliers 
also includes cost of certain materials used to build portions of the smart energy matrix outside our facility in tyngsboro  massachusetts which are not movable fungible to another site 
legal increase due primarily to costs associated with the arete lawsuit 
twelve months ended december  comment in thousands salaries and benefits  primarily due to increase in headcount in engineering  manufacturing  and materials management associated with move from development to production activities 
consultants and subcontractors increase due primarily to amounts paid to contractor to build portions of the smart energy matrix outside our facility in tyngsboro  massachusetts that are not movable fungible to another site 
allocation of overhead to contracts all but one contract was complete at end of  shift of effort from contract work to completing development  manufacturing  testing and installing first frequency regulation facility in tyngsboro resulted in decrease in overhead charged to contracts in from facility costs higher cost of new  larger facility 
stock compensation expense increase in compensation cost for options granted to new hires and as part of the incentive plan payout  partially offset by the reversal of previously recorded stock compensation expense associated with a grant of performance based rsus for which management no longer believes achievement is probable 
other includes higher costs of repair and maintenance  software and outside testing 
moving related costs primarily costs associated with moving our facility from wilmington to tyngsboro  massachusetts  which were incurred in late  and to a lesser extent  in early period ended december  for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased by approximately million or  in comparison to the equivalent period in see the table above for explanations of the factors which were responsible for the most significant changes to research and development spending 
we expect research and development costs during to be lower than in due to lower legal costs  along with lower expense material and subcontractor costs 
loss on contract commitments our contracts have been primarily for the development of demonstration units of new products and the design of a frequency regulation plant 
as such  the work has supported our core research and development efforts 
most of these contracts have been structured on a cost share basis  for which the expected cost share has been recorded as a contract loss 
we recorded contract commitment losses on our research and development contracts in and  which we reduced in by approximately  as we completed all but one contract for amounts which were less than previously estimated 
in april we were awarded a subcontract to provide a flywheel energy storage system in support of a wind integration research and development r d project sponsored by the california energy commission 
we will receive approximately  to offset r d expenses and will contribute an additional  of engineering resources for the project  bringing the r d total to approximately  in addition to the california energy commission  which is funding the project  other leading stakeholders include southern california edison and the california iso 
the flywheel system will be installed in tehachapi  california  a high potential wind resource area where  according to a report from the california iso  up to  megawatts of wind power may be added in the coming years 
our flywheel energy storage systems may also have the potential to address shortages in transmission line capacity  which this wind power integration project is intended to prove 
the primary goal of the project is to demonstrate that advanced control technology with energy storage can help expand the delivery of renewable wind energy by effectively increasing the capacity of constrained transmission facilities in the tehachapi area 
this project supports california s goal to upgrade and expand its electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure per the state s energy action plan of we recorded a charge of approximately  during the second quarter of to reflect the expected cost share portion of the tehachapi contract 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased from approximately  during the year ended december  to approximately  for the same period in  an increase of approximately  or 
the increase is primarily due to capital expenditures relating to leasehold improvements at our new manufacturing and office facility in tyngsboro  as well as the purchase of machinery and equipment required to begin commercial production 
as of december   we had approximately million in construction in progress  of which approximately million are materials to build flywheels and approximately million are costs related to the construction of smart energy matrix systems 
we expect depreciation expense to continue to increase during as we build and place our frequency regulation facilities into commercial operation 
interest and other income expense  net average cash balances during were lower than during the same periods in  as were interest rates 
in addition  in  we obtained a loan from mass development  for which we began paying interest in october these factors contribute to a reduction of net interest and other income of approximately  or  over the equivalent period last year 
net loss as a result of the changes discussed above  the net loss for the year ended december   was approximately  as compared to a net loss during the same period in of approximately  this represents an increase in net loss of approximately  or 
the increase in the loss for the year is due primarily to the factors discussed above

in we recorded revenue from flywheel related government contracts of approximately  and approximately  from the sale of smart power m inverter systems and related products 
contract revenue was higher in compared to by approximately  or  primarily the result of the completion of our contracts with the air force research laboratory and with the us department of energy doe  administered by sandia national laboratories 
the purpose of the sandia doe contract was to design a megawatt smart energy matrix frequency regulation facility 
this project directly supported our plan to develop a commercial scale flywheel based frequency regulation facility in cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in includes costs incurred in performance of government contracts calculated on the percentage of completion method in the amount of approximately  and the cost of materials  labor  overheads and warranty accruals for inverter products sold in the amount of approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses year ended december  comment in thousands period ended december   increases decreases salaries and benefits increased headcount facility costs hiring expenses travel telephone reduction of bad debt reserve audit fees trade shows other office upgrades and equipment repairs subcontractors and consultants less use of consultants public company expenses allocation of overhead to contracts represents allocation of g a overhead to the sandia contract  our other contracts did not allow us to allocate g a overhead 
stock compensation expense mainly due to a decrease in the black scholes value of options issued in compared to the valuation for options issued during the prior year 
period ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses totaled approximately  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the most significant factors associated with the increase in costs is shown in the table above 
research and development expenses year ended december  comment in thousands period ended december   increases decreases salaries and benefits increased expenses resulting from the hiring of engineering personnel during the latter half of to support our flywheel development and testing facility costs increase primarily due to the cost of operating facilities in both tyngsboro and wilmington as we prepared the tyngsboro facility for occupancy consultants and subcontractors increased use of consultants allocation of overhead to contracts lower allocation of overhead to contracts costs related to facility move costs associated with relocating our facility from wilmington to tyngsboro  massachusetts expense materials increased use of materials in the development of our smart energy flywheel legal legal expenses charged to manufacturing represents primarily cost of developing and protecting our patents and in defending against arete patent infringement claim 
hiring expenses outside testing travel other stock compensation expense lower black scholes valuation for options issued during the early portion of period ended december  for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased by approximately million or  in comparison to the equivalent period in in addition to the comments shown above explaining the fluctuation in costs  in december  we experienced a flywheel malfunction during testing in one of our test cells which resulted in damage to some research and development materials  test equipment  facility and the prototype flywheel being tested 
during we recovered essentially all of the costs associated with the malfunction from our insurance carriers 
the insurance proceeds were used to offset previously recorded casualty losses and to offset the costs of expensed materials used to build the prototype flywheel 
in addition to costs associated with the malfunction  we spent approximately  to investigate the cause of the malfunction and to insure that the necessary modifications were implemented to prevent similar malfunctions in the future 
these costs are included in the increased cost shown for consultants and subcontractors  above 
loss on contract commitments our contracts have been primarily for the development of demonstration units of new products and the design of a frequency regulation installation 
as such  the work has supported our core research and development efforts 
most of these contracts have been structured on a cost share basis  for which the expected cost share has been recorded as a contract loss 
we recorded contract commitment losses on our research and development contracts in of  based on expected cost overruns related to material  labor and overhead required to complete the contracts 
during  we recorded additional charges totaling approximately  to the contract loss reserve 
this amount consisted of net increases in estimated material  labor  overhead and travel costs expected to complete existing contracts along with our expected cost share portion of the sandia contract 
by the end of  all but one smaller government contract was complete 
we recorded a reduction to the losses on contract commitments of approximately  based on the actual cost to complete these contracts  which was less than previously estimated 
this amount consisted of net decreases in material  labor  overhead and travel costs required to complete existing contracts of approximately  in addition  since our actual overhead rate was lower than forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year  we reduced the overhead applied to the contracts and our contract loss reserve by an additional depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation expense for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in of approximately  or  was primarily attributable to depreciation on new assets acquired during and the latter half of interest and other income expense  net interest income for the year ended december   was approximately  greater than for the equivalent period in the primary reason for this difference is that cash balances available for investing were on average higher than during the same period in the prior year  primarily as a result of the cash obtained through the sale of stock and warrants at various times during the increased interest income was offset by decreases in other income of approximately  net loss as a result of the changes discussed above  the net loss for the year ended december   was approximately  as compared to a net loss during the same period in of approximately  this represents an increase in net loss of approximately  or 
the increase in the loss for the year is due primarily to the factors discussed above  particularly increased spending on research and development activities  facility costs related to the move to the tyngsboro facility and the temporary maintenance of two facilities  partially offset by decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses and the reduction in contract loss recorded during liquidity and capital resources twelve months ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents working capital cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents current ratio our cash requirements depend on many factors including  but not limited to  cost to build our flywheels and frequency regulation facilities  research and development activities  facility costs as well as general and administrative expenses 
since we are still in the development stage and have not yet generated significant revenue from our principal operations  we do not generate enough cash from operations to satisfy our working capital requirements 
we expect to make significant expenditures to fund our operations  develop technologies and explore opportunities to find and develop additional markets to sell our products 
in previous years  we took significant actions to reduce our cash expenditures for product development  infrastructure and production readiness by reducing headcount  development spending and capital expenditures 
however  as we completed development of the smart energy matrix and began commercial activity aimed at revenue generation in  we increased our headcount and spent additional funds on production materials  capital equipment  market analyses and the pursuit of regulatory relief to modify market rules in a way that ensures our ability to enter markets on a timely and profitable basis 
we expect to require significant cash resources during through as we increase capacity to manufacture our smart energy flywheels and build frequency regulation facilities 
due to uncertainty and volatility in the equity markets  we only deployed one mw capacity through the iso ne pilot program in we plan to re deploy the additional megawatts originally planned for the pilot program to our site in stephentown 
in volume production  our goal is to complete a mw facility at an approximate cost of to million  while the first mw plant will cost approximately million 
in our business plan is to deploy mw of capacity at our first mw site and an additional megawatt in ohio through aep  however the number of megawatts we will be able to deploy is dependent on obtaining sufficient funding for these capital outlays 
we expect to fund the construction of our first mw plant from a combination of debt and equity 
our ability to obtain sufficient funding will pace our ability to produce flywheel systems and deploy them 
in and  we will continue to have capital needs that will require additional equity and debt to fund the ongoing deployment of frequency regulation facilities 
we must raise additional equity and or project financing to execute our business plan 
based on our rate of expenditure of cash and the additional expenditures expected to support our business plan  we have sufficient cash to fund operations through the second quarter of we need to obtain additional cash during to to fund our continuation as a going concern ongoing refinements of the smart energy flywheel and the smart energy matrix system the ramp up of our manufacturing and assembly capacity the manufacture of flywheels and the build out of installations to provide frequency regulation services to the electricity grid working capital requirements  and the identification and development of new business opportunities 
on february   we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with seaside  lp  valued at up to million 
the agreement requires seaside to buy million of common stock from us once each month for up to months  beginning on february   and on the th day of each month thereafter or the next closest business day 
the agreement is structured in three six month tranches  or segments  each covering monthly closings of million each  for up to million total 
we are committed to only the first six month tranche  but we have the option  exercisable at our sole discretion  to extend the agreement for up to two additional six month periods each for up to million  for a total of up to million over the three tranches 
under the terms of this agreement  on february   we issued  shares to seaside at a price per share of for an aggregate value of  in order to implement our business plan to build  operate and receive fees for frequency regulation services and have sufficient working capital to continue to execute our business plan through  in addition to the funds expected from the sale of stock to seaside  we will need to raise funds though a combination of debt and equity during also  to achieve our out year deployment plan for additional frequency regulation facilities  we will need to raise additional capital beyond either from project finance or additional equity transactions 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was approximately   and  for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
the primary component to the negative cash flow from operations is from net losses 
net loss for was approximately  the net operating loss was partially offset by non cash charges of approximately  for stock compensation expense   for depreciation  approximately  related to the issuance of stock to settle a lawsuit  deferred rent of approximately  and approximately  interest expense related to the issuance of warrants issued in conjunction with the massdev loan 
changes in operating assets and liabilities generated approximately  in addition  we received  from our landlord as a credit for certain building improvements 
net loss for was approximately  cash used by operations was partially reduced by an insurance recovery of approximately  relating to a malfunction that occurred in december during testing of a prototype flywheel 
in addition  the net operating loss was partially offset by non cash charges of approximately  and  for stock compensation expense and depreciation  respectively 
changes in operating assets and liabilities generated approximately  in cash which were more than offset by deferred rent of approximately  expenses paid against a previously recorded restructuring reserve of approximately  and a gain on sale of fixed assets of approximately  net loss for was approximately  this loss was offset by non cash charges of approximately   and  for stock compensation expense  depreciation and an increase in the asset impairment reserve  respectively 
changes in operating assets and liabilities generated approximately  of cash  which was partially offset by expenses paid against a previously recorded restructuring reserve of approximately  investing activities net cash used in investing activities was approximately   and  for  and  respectively 
the primary use of cash for was the purchase and construction of property and equipment of approximately  the capital additions include approximately  which is classified as construction in progress as of the end of december  most of which consisted of completed flywheels  trailers housing electronic components  along with material  labor and overhead 
in  we reduced restricted cash by  due to the completion of the wilmington lease 
this amount was partially offset by a requirement from iso ne to implement a restricted cash account for financial assurance purposes in the amount of approximately  the primary use of cash from investing activities for was the purchase and construction of property and equipment of approximately  the capital additions include approximately  which is classified as construction in progress as of the end of december  most of which relates to the build out of our tyngsboro headquarters 
approximately  of the additions relate to production material was purchased to build flywheels for commercial use in our smart energy matrices 
in  we increased restricted cash by  as a requirement under our tyngsboro lease 
proceeds from the sale of equipment provided approximately  in cash in the primary use of cash for was the purchase of property and equipments of approximately  the capital additions were partially offset by reductions of restricted cash of approximately financing activities net cash generated by financing activities was approximately   and  for  and  respectively 
during  we raised approximately  from the sale of our stock and warrants  net of expenses  approximately  from a loan from massdev  approximately  for the exercise of employee stock options and approximately  for the issuance of stock to our employees under the employee stock purchase plan  offset by approximately  paid for financing costs 
during  we raised approximately  from the sale of our stock  approximately  for stock and warrants issued to the landlord  approximately  for the exercise of employee stock options and approximately  for the issuance of stock to our employees under the employee stock purchase plan 
for  approximately  in cash was provided by the exercise of employee stock options  along with approximately  received for shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan 
as part of our new business development  we may evaluate possible acquisitions of enterprises or technologies that we consider synergistic from a market  technology or product perspective 
we may make investments in companies for strategic business reasons 
because our primary motivation in making these investments may not be to realize a profit on the investment itself  but rather to expand our business prospects  these investments may lack any financial return to the company and may result in a loss of principal and may impair our liquidity 
the following table summarizes our commitments at december  description of commitment operating lease purchase obligations total period ending december  december  december  december  december  december  thereafter total commitments at december   we had firm purchase commitments with our suppliers of approximately million 
these commitments are for components for our commercial flywheel systems  completion of the build out of the tyngsboro facility  and to satisfy contractual obligations for our research and development programs  among other things 
in addition  we have a commitment of approximately million to purchase a key component from a supplier who has not yet been able to meet our technical specifications 
we do have another supplier for this component 
however  since our objective is to have at least two suppliers for all key components  we are working closely with the supplier to resolve this from a technical perspective 
if not  however  the contract will be cancelled due to the supplier s inability to perform 
in july  we signed a seven year lease on a new corporate headquarters that significantly expanded our manufacturing capacity and provides sufficient space to continue our research and development activities 
the amounts listed for operating leases represent payments for the occupancy of our principal executive offices  laboratory and manufacturing facilities located at middlesex road tyngsboro  massachusetts 
this  square foot facility has manufacturing capacity for the production of up to flywheels per year 
we have a second phase manufacturing build out planned that will increase annual manufacturing capacity to more than  flywheels 
the lease on our previous facility in wilmington  ma expired at the end of november as part of the tyngsboro lease agreement  we issued to the landlord  shares of our common stock pursuant to our registration statement on form s filed on august   which became effective on august   and a warrant exercisable for  shares of our common stock pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of  as amended  in return for lower cash payments payable by us under the lease 
we have provided the wilmington and tyngsboro lessors with irrevocable letters of credit securing our performance under these leases with a balance at december  and of  and  respectively  which are reduced periodically during the lease terms 
these letters of credit are secured by a cash deposit  which is included in restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we are responsible for real estate taxes and all operating expenses of the tyngsboro facility 
in the future  additional capital expenditures may be required for a phase two build out of manufacturing capacity 
the amount and timing of these expenditures are dependent on requirements of equipment needed to meet production schedules as well as having sufficient funding 
financing on december   we sold  units of the company at a purchase price of per unit for a total of approximately million  net of expenses 
each unit consisted of one share of our common stock  par value per share  and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share  for a total of  warrants 
the warrants become exercisable six months and one day after their issuance  and expire five and one half years after their issuance 
the units were issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the securities and exchange commission in connection with a registration statement on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission that became effective on july  on october   we sold  units of the company at a purchase price of per unit for a total of approximately million  net of expenses 
each unit consisted of one share of our common stock  par value per share  and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share  for a total of  warrants 
the warrants become exercisable six months and one day after their issuance  and expire five and one half years after their issuance 
the units were issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the securities and exchange commission in connection with a registration statement on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission that became effective on july  on june   we entered into an agreement with massachusetts development finance agency massdev pursuant to which massdev agreed to lend us up to million 
this loan derives from a funding collaboration between the emerging technology fund of massdev and the massachusetts technology collaborative s business expansion initiative 
the massdev loan is evidenced by a promissory note under which we may make one or more requests for advances of up to an aggregate of million for the purchase of equipment and installation of certain tenant improvements at our tyngsboro  massachusetts facility 
we have one year following the date of the initial advance to draw on the loan 
the initial advance on the loan was made on october  for approximately million 
the note will mature months after the initial advance and bears a fixed annual interest rate of 
as partial consideration for the loan  on june   we issued massdev two warrants 
each warrant provides for the purchase of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to any adjustments as set forth in the warrants 
the warrants are exercisable for seven years commencing on june  and provide for registration rights for the resale of the shares issued upon their exercise 
massdev assigned one of the warrants to the massachusetts technology park corporation mtpc  as part of mtpc s participation under the massachusetts technology collaborative s business expansion initiative 
the fair value of the warrants is being amortized over the term of the loan 
in october  we sold  units of the company at a purchase price of per unit  for a total of approximately million  net of expenses 
each unit consisted of one share of our common stock  par value per share  and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  for a total of  warrants 
the units were issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the securities and exchange commission in connection with our registration statement on form s for million filed on august   which became effective on august  in september  we sold  units of the company at a purchase price of per unit 
each unit consisted of one share of our common stock  par value per share  and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  for a total of  warrants 
in addition   warrants were issued to the placement agents at the same price per share 
the units were issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the securities and exchange commission in connection with our registration statement on form s for million filed on august   which became effective on august  in july we entered into a lease for a new facility in tyngsboro  ma 
we agreed under the terms of the lease to issue to the landlord pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of  as amended  a warrant exercisable for  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant and the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant are restricted securities and may not be sold without registration under the securities act of  as amended  and applicable state securities laws or an exemption there from 
in addition  we issued the landlord  shares of common stock 
in february  we sold  units of the company at a purchase price of per unit 
each unit consisted of one share of our common stock  par value per share  and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  for a total of  warrants 
as part of the transaction   warrants were issued to the placement agent 
the units were issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the securities and exchange commission in connection with an effective registration statement on form s previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 
there were no significant financing activities during inasmuch as we are not expecting to become cash flow positive until at least  our ability to continue as a going concern will depend on our ability to raise additional capital 
we may not be able to raise this capital at all  or if we are able to do so  it may be on terms that are adverse to shareholders 
we believe that project debt financing may be available to us to meet some portion of our cash requirements for inflation our operations have not been materially affected by inflation 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash equivalents and investments  all of which have maturities of less than ninety days  could expose us to interest rate risk 
at december   we had approximately  of cash equivalents that were held in a non interest bearing checking account 
also at december  we had approximately million of cash equivalents that were held in interest bearing money market accounts at high quality financial institutions  some of which are invested in off shore securities 
the fair value of these investments approximates their cost 
a change in interest rates would change the investment income realized on an annual basis by approximately  which we do not believe is material 
the funds invested in money market accounts may not be covered under fdic insurance  and therefore may be at some risk of loss 
approximately million of our cash on hand at december  was invested in a mutual fund that was enrolled in the us treasury department s temporary guarantee program for money market funds 
under the guarantee program  the us treasury guarantees the per share value of funds outstanding as of september   subject to certain terms and limitations 
the program has been extended by the treasury department until april   but may be further extended by the treasury department to terminate no later than september  the guarantee will be triggered if the market based net asset value of the fund is less than  unless promptly cured
