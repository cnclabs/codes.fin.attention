item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to forward looking statements following the index in front of this form k and item a risk factors on pages through of this annual report 
overview our diagnostics operating segments provide the largest share of our consolidated revenues   and for fiscal  and  respectively 
sales from our four focus families c 
difficile  upper respiratory  h 
pylori  and foodborne comprised of our diagnostics operating segments revenues during fiscal revenue growth during the first half of fiscal for our diagnostics operating segments was a negative  as a result of a weakened global economy  inventory de stocking by our major distributors and a relatively mild influenza season 
revenue growth during the second half of fiscal was a positive  primarily driven by the world wide outbreak of novel a hn influenza that began in april and continues today  and new product revenues in our foodborne family 
revenue growth for the full fiscal year in was also impacted by foreign currency translation  which contributed translation losses of approximately  the usd euro exchange rate averaged approximately during fiscal  compared to during fiscal upper respiratory products during fiscal  upper respiratory sales for our diagnostics operating segments increased compared to fiscal  driven by the outbreak of novel a hn influenza virus that began to spread across countries in the northern hemisphere during the second half of fiscal the novel a hn influenza outbreak created an early start to the influenza season  resulting in increased upper respiratory sales for influenza products in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal this outbreak has also created an increased interest in influenza testing in european markets where rapid testing has not been traditionally performed  resulting in revenue growth of in this operating segment on an organic basis 
at the present time  seasonal influenza has not yet emerged  however  novel a hn activity continues to be high in the united states and europe 
sales of our influenza products have remained steady during the first quarter of fiscal the respiratory season was the first full season in which we sold our internally developed and manufactured tru flu and tru rsv products 
our tru flu and tru rsv products represented approximately of our total influenza and respiratory syncytial virus product sales for fiscal  compared to less than in fiscal we expect this percentage to continue to increase  yielding continuing improvements in gross profit margins 
our tru format  with its sample tube and test device  offers better containment of the specimen sample compared to card type devices 
customers are reacting positively to this feature  especially in the current pandemic 

table of contents foodborne products over the last three fiscal years  we have launched three foodborne products  immunocard stat ehec in fiscal  and premier tm campy and immunocard stat campy in fiscal the volume growth from these new products has more than doubled the global revenues for this disease family since fiscal  and this is now a  product family 
the disease family is expected to generate significant sales growth in fiscal c 
difficile products considerable confusion has developed in the c 
difficile market over the relative benefits of the various test methods available toxin testing  antigen testing and molecular testing 
several new competitive products  including molecular assays  have recently been introduced into this market  causing competitive pressures for our products and slowing organic growth rates to single digits 
we expect to combat these competitive pressures with our strong position in toxin testing and the development of our illumigene tm molecular c 
difficile product 
our new molecular test for c 
difficile on our illumigene tm platform is in the final stages of product design 
we are currently conducting beta site evaluations and have recent data that meets or exceeds our expectations 
we are targeting revenue contributions from the launch of this technology later in the first half of fiscal h 
pylori products during fiscal  sales of our h 
pylori products grew for our us diagnostics operating segment and for our european diagnostics operating segment on an organic basis 
our partnerships with managed care companies in promoting the health and economic benefits of a test and treat strategy is beginning to move physician behavior away from serology based testing to direct antigen testing 
the modest level of growth for our european diagnostics operating segment reflects impact from pricing pressures from competitive products in european markets 

table of contents life science operating segment sales for our life science operating segment increased for fiscal compared to fiscal this slight increase reflects buying patterns of our two largest diagnostic manufacturing customers  who accounted for of the life science operating segment s sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal we expect high single digit growth for this operating segment in fiscal due to manufacturing efficiency improvements at our memphis  tennessee facility  we have seen significant year over year improvements in operating income contributions in fiscal compared to fiscal all segments we have generated a consolidated gross profit margin of for fiscal this level of gross profit margin reflects favorable efficiencies from automation in our us diagnostics manufacturing plant  changing product mix in favor of higher margin manufactured products over lower margin third party influenza and rsv products within the upper respiratory product family  and improved operating performance and utilization of our life science manufacturing facility in memphis  tennessee 
although foreign currency exchange rates had a negative effect on sales of our european diagnostics operating segment  they had no significant effect on consolidated gross profit or consolidated operating income due to natural hedges 
our us diagnostics operating segment markets and sells certain meridian branded diagnostic test kits that are sourced from european suppliers in spain and germany 
these kits are purchased in euros  which provides a natural hedge to gross profit and operating income on a consolidated basis 
the recessionary state of the economy during fiscal is affecting not only the us  but also countries around the world 
we cannot predict the timing or magnitude of recovery from this recession 
if economic conditions worsen or remain in a recessed state for an extended period of time  our sales levels could be adversely affected by customer buying patterns in their efforts to conserve cash and manage inventory levels 
on a longer term basis  in a recessed economic state  our sales levels could be adversely impacted by the number of diagnostic tests performed in the healthcare system  if  for example  there were declines in physician office visits and or hospital admissions 
our product portfolios  for both diagnostics and life science  deal with acute patient symptoms and infectious diseases 
to date  we have not seen any significant reduction in end user demand for our major products as a result of economic conditions 
from a cash flow perspective  we expect cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditure requirements and dividends over the next months 

table of contents financial discipline is one of our fundamental principles in running the day to day business regardless of the state of the business cycle and economy 
the following table illustrates key income and expense elements as a percentage of sales 
we look for continued improvement in each of these measures each year  regardless of macro economic market conditions 
gross profit operating expenses operating income operating segments our reportable operating segments are us diagnostics  european diagnostics  and life science 
the us diagnostics operating segment consists of manufacturing operations in cincinnati  ohio  and the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in the us and countries outside of europe  africa and the middle east 
the european diagnostics operating segment consists of the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in europe  africa and the middle east 
the life science operating segment consists of manufacturing operations in memphis  tennessee  saco  maine  and boca raton  florida  and the sale and distribution of bulk antigens  antibodies  and bioresearch reagents domestically and abroad 
the life science operating segment also includes the contract development and manufacture of proteins and other biologicals for use by biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in research for new drugs and vaccines 
revenues for the diagnostics operating segments  in the normal course of business  may be affected by buying patterns of major distributors  seasonality and strength of certain diseases  and foreign currency exchange rates 
revenues for the life science operating segment  in the normal course of business  may be affected by the timing and nature of arrangements for contract services work  which may have longer production cycles than bioresearch reagents and bulk antigens and antibodies  as well as buying patterns of major customers 
we believe that the overall breadth of our product lines serves to reduce the variability in consolidated revenues 
results of operations fourth quarter net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased to  or per diluted share  from net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal of  or per diluted share 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased sales coupled with management of discretionary spending 
sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal were  an increase of  or  compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal sales for the us diagnostics operating segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  and benefited from volume increases in sales of influenza products related to the novel a hn influenza outbreak  along with growth in our foodborne products 
importantly  sales of our tru flu and tru rsv products increased to approximately of our total influenza and respiratory syncytial virus product sales during the quarter 
sales for our european diagnostics and life science operating segments increased and  respectively  during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal on an organic basis  which excludes the effects of currency translation  sales for our european diagnostics operating segment increased during the fourth quarter  benefitting from sales of our tru flu and tru rsv products 

table of contents fiscal year net earnings for fiscal increased to  or per diluted share from net earnings for fiscal of  or per diluted share 
results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal are discussed below 
net earnings and earnings per share for fiscal include the effects of a tax benefit in the amount of  or per basic and diluted share  related to a discrete adjustment to tax reserves that was recorded in the third quarter upon the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain income tax returns see note to the consolidated financial statements herein 
the tables below provide information on net earnings  basic earnings per share  and diluted earnings per share  excluding this tax benefit  as well as reconciliations to amounts reported under us generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that this information is useful to those who read our financial statements and evaluate our operating results because these measures help to appropriately evaluate and compare the results of operations from period to period by removing the favorable impact of a discrete material item that is not expected to recur in the future  and these measures are used by our management for various purposes  including evaluating performance against incentive bonus achievement targets  comparing performance from period to period in presentations to our board of directors  and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting

sales breakdown inc dec inc dec us diagnostics european diagnostics life science consolidated international us diagnostics export life science export european diagnostics total of total sales growth for our diagnostics operating segments was led by volume increases in upper respiratory products driven by the outbreak of novel a hn influenza experienced in the united states beginning in the spring of sales for this product family increased approximately over fiscal  which showed double digit increases over fiscal sales of upper respiratory products grew in fiscal for the us diagnostics operating segment  and grew for our european diagnostics operating segment on an organic basis 
sales increases for this product family included sales from our new products launched during the first quarter of fiscal  tru flu and tru rsv 
these two products represented approximately of our total influenza and respiratory syncytial virus product sales for fiscal  compared to less than in fiscal we also saw significant volume increases for our foodborne products family  specifically related to our immunocard stat ehec product 
the ehec product was developed in collaboration with merck for detection of toxin producing e 
coli in patients that may have ingested contaminated produce or meat products and was launched in fiscal two new campylobacter products were launched during fiscal  which also contributed to volume growth 
our h

fiscal and fiscal sales for the life science operating segment reflect changes in demand and buying patterns of certain of our major diagnostic manufacturing customers and non renewal of a supply contract with the us department of defense 
changes in the us department of defense s critical reagents program led to non renewal of this contract after fiscal we sell three main products to a major diagnostic manufacturing customer  who accounted for   and of total sales for the life science operating segment for fiscal  and  respectively

inc dec inc dec gross profit gross profit margin the increases in gross profit margins from to reflect a stronger mix of sales from our diagnostics operating segments  including higher margins on rapid tests  and production efficiencies from automation initiatives in our diagnostics manufacturing facility 
manufacturing efficiency improvements at our memphis  tennessee facility  have also contributed to year over year improvements in gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents our overall operations consist of the sale of diagnostic test kits for various disease states and in alternative test formats  as well as bioresearch reagents  bulk antigens and antibodies  proficiency panels  and contract research and development and contract manufacturing services 
product sales mix shifts  in the normal course of business  can cause the consolidated gross profit margin to fluctuate by several points 
research selling general total operating development marketing administrative expenses expenses of sales fiscal increases decreases us diagnostics european diagnostics life science expenses of sales increase decrease fiscal increases decreases us diagnostics european diagnostics life science expenses of sales increase decrease operating expenses for the us diagnostics operating segment increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal and  for fiscal compared to fiscal increases in both years were primarily attributable to development costs for our molecular c 
difficile product and additional salaries and benefits related to planned headcount additions 
the fiscal period also saw increased marketing and clinical trial expenses related to new products 
these increases were partially offset by decreased stock based compensation and decreased corporate incentive bonus related to earnings achieved for fiscal and attainment of lower level bonus targets in fiscal compared to fiscal no corporate incentive bonus has been recorded for salaried employees for fiscal operating expenses for the european diagnostics operating segment decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal and increased for fiscal compared to fiscal the fluctuations for fiscal and fiscal were primarily attributable to currency fluctuations 

table of contents operating expenses for the life science operating segment decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal the fiscal decrease was primarily attributable to reduced salaries and benefits related to lower headcount 
the amount of stock based compensation expense reported for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal was   and  respectively 
during november and november  we granted to certain employees stock options and restricted stock that were contingent upon meridian achieving a specified net earnings level for each fiscal year 
because meridian s fiscal net earnings did not reach the minimum level in or  these awards were not earned 
no stock based compensation has been recorded for these awards 
similarly  during november  we granted to certain employees stock options that were contingent upon meridian achieving a specified net earnings level for fiscal because meridian s fiscal net earnings surpassed the minimum level  these stock options were earned and are now exercisable over a vesting period 
operating income operating income increased and in fiscal and  respectively  as a result of the factors discussed above 
other income and expense interest income was   and  for fiscal   and  respectively 
the decreases during fiscal and fiscal were driven by lower interest yields due to a higher concentration of investments in money market funds in fiscal and lower interest rates in the current interest rate environment  somewhat offset by higher average investment balances 
income taxes the effective rate for income taxes was   and for fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to a discrete adjustment to tax reserves in the third quarter of fiscal in the amount of  this discrete adjustment reduced the effective tax rate for fiscal by points 
impact of inflation to the extent feasible  we have consistently followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services 
inflation and changing prices did not have a material adverse impact our gross margin  revenue or operating income in fiscal  or 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources comparative cash flow analysis our cash flow and financing requirements are determined by analyses of operating and capital spending budgets  consideration of acquisition plans  and consideration of common share dividends 
we have historically maintained a credit facility to augment working capital requirements and to respond quickly to acquisition opportunities 
this credit facility has been supplemented by the proceeds from a september common share offering  which during most of fiscal  were invested in a non interest bearing bank deposit account  overnight repurchase agreements  institutional money market mutual funds and tax exempt auction rate securities 
we have an investment policy that guides the holdings of our investment portfolio 
our objectives in managing the investment portfolio are to i preserve capital  ii provide sufficient liquidity to meet working capital requirements and fund strategic objectives such as acquisitions  and iii capture a market rate of return commensurate with market conditions and our policy s investment eligibility criteria 
as a result of conditions in the financial markets  we have chosen to keep the maturity of our investment portfolio very short 
as we look forward  we will continue to manage the holdings of our investment portfolio with preservation of capital being the primary objective 
except as otherwise described herein  we do not expect current conditions in the financial markets  or overall economic conditions to have a significant impact on our liquidity needs  financial condition  or results of operations 
we intend to continue to fund our working capital requirements and dividends from current cash flows from operating activities 
we also have additional sources of liquidity through our investment portfolio and  bank credit facility  if needed 
to date  we have not experienced any significant deterioration in the aging of our customer accounts receivable nor in our vendors ability to supply raw materials and services and extend normal credit terms 
our liquidity needs may change if overall economic conditions worsen and or liquidity and credit within the financial markets remains tight for an extended period of time  and such conditions impact the collectability of our customer accounts receivable  or impact credit terms with our vendors  or disrupt the supply of raw materials and services 
overall stock market valuations declined early in fiscal only to rebound in the latter part of the year 
these fluctuations may raise questions as to the potential impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
our annual goodwill impairment review takes place as of june th each year 
there have been no impairments from these annual reviews 
despite the overall decline in stock market valuations  as of october   our stock price was per share  compared to our book value per share of as of september  this relationship  stock price trading at x book value  is an indicator that the decline in overall stock market valuations  and its impact on our stock price  has not been a triggering event for impairment of our goodwill and other long lived assets 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities increased to  in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to higher earnings levels and timing of payments with suppliers 
net cash used for investing activities was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced purchases of property  plant  and equipment in fiscal  changes in our investment portfolio during fiscal and  including purchases of auction rate securities in fiscal  and purchases of intangible assets related to patents and an acquired recombinant viral protein product line in fiscal net cash used for financing activities was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in dividend payments and a decrease of  in proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of stock options 
dividend payments in fiscal reflect increased dividend rates and common shares outstanding related to stock option exercises 
net cash flows from operating activities are anticipated to fund working capital requirements and dividends during the next twelve months 
capital resources we have a  credit facility with a commercial bank which expires september  as of november   there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
we did not have any borrowing under this facility during fiscal or our capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately  for fiscal  and may be funded with cash and equivalents on hand  operating cash flows  and or availability under the  credit facility discussed above 
capital expenditures relate to manufacturing and other equipment of a normal and recurring nature  as well as the build out of the recently purchased property in the village of newtown 
student loan auction rate securities our investment portfolio includes student loan auction rate securities  which are long term student loan revenue bonds whose interest rates are reset every days via a dutch auction process 
all of our auction rate securities are backed by pools of student loans originated under the federal family education loan program ffelp 
ffelp student loans are guaranteed by state guarantors who have reinsurance agreements with the us department of education 
all of our student loan auction rate securities were rated aaa and aaa by moody s and standard poor s  respectively  at the time of purchase  and have continued to maintain these credit ratings through the present time 

table of contents the dutch auction process historically provided the necessary liquidity mechanism to either purchase or sell these securities 
beginning in mid february  liquidity issues in the us credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions across a broad spectrum of tax exempt securities  including student loan revenue bonds 
auctions for the student loan revenue bonds that we hold have continued to fail through the present time 
the consequence of a failed auction is that we do not have access to the principal amount of our investments 
issuers are still required to make interest payments when due in the event of failed auctions 
we have not experienced any missed interest payments to date 
our auction rate securities were purchased through ubs financial services  inc during november  we accepted an offer from ubs  ag ubs of auction rate security rights 
these rights permit us to require ubs between june  and july  the exercise period to purchase our auction rate securities at par value 
in exchange  ubs is granted the right  at their sole discretion  to sell or otherwise dispose of our auction rate security investments until july  as long as we receive a payment of par value upon the sale or disposition 
in addition  the rights permit us to establish a demand revolving credit line in an amount equal to the par value of the securities at a net no cost 
we are still able to sell the auction rate securities on our own  but in such a circumstance  we would lose the par value support from ubs 
upon executing the settlement agreement with ubs  we recognized the auction rate security rights as a stand alone financial instrument and elected the fair value option 
we also transferred the student loan auction rate securities from the available for sale classification  to the trading classification 
upon transfer to the trading classification  in unrealized losses as of september   were transferred from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income and expense 
adjustments to the fair value of student loan auction rate securities and auction rate security rights are recorded to other income and expense in each accounting period 
as of september   the fair value of the student loan auction rate securities was  compared to a par value of  as of september   the fair value of the auction rate security rights was the student loan auction rate securities and auction rate security rights are included in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet based on the earliest exercise date of june  
table of contents known contractual obligations known contractual obligations and their related due dates were as follows as of september  less than more than total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations uncertain income tax positions liability and interest total meridian and its subsidiaries are lessees of i office and warehouse buildings in cincinnati  florida  belgium  and france  ii automobiles for use by the diagnostic direct sales forces in the us and europe  and iii certain office equipment such as facsimile machines and copier machines across all business units  under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates 
meridian s purchase obligations are primarily outstanding purchase orders for inventory and service items 
these contractual commitments are not in excess of expected production requirements over the next twelve months 
as of september   our liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties were and  respectively 
due to inherent uncertainties in the timing of settlement of tax positions  we are unable to estimate the timing of the effective settlement of these obligations 
other commitments and off balance sheet arrangements license agreements meridian has entered into various license agreements that require payment of royalties based on a specified percentage of sales of related products to 
meridian expects that payments under these agreements will amount to as much as in fiscal these royalty payments primarily relate to the us diagnostics operating segment 
meridian entered into a license agreement in october with a third party that provides rights to a molecular technology for infectious disease testing in the united states  europe and other geographic markets 
the agreement  as amended during fiscal  calls for payments of up to approximately based on the achievement of certain product development milestones and on going royalties once products are available for commercial sale 
payments made during product development are expected to occur over a five year period  which began in fiscal payments of  and were made during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  related to this license 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began seeking recovery of approximately  of past royalties paid and interest under a license agreement around certain rapid diagnostic testing technology 
this license agreement covered patent rights that were narrowed in scope via other litigation with the licensor that did not involve meridian 
we strongly believe that the licensed patent  as reissued  does not cover any of our products 
we also ceased further royalty payments under this license agreement 
the licensor to this agreement disputes our position that the patent  as reissued  does not cover our products 
although we believe that our position is very strong  we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter 
no provision has been made in the accompanying financial statements for on going royalties  if any  nor has any accrual or income been recorded for recovery of past royalties paid 
derivative financial instruments prior to february   we managed exchange rate risk related to forecasted intercompany sales denominated in the euro currency through the use of forward exchange contracts 
we designated such forward contracts as cash flow hedges 
as such  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument was reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affected earnings 
as of september   we had no such contracts outstanding 
during january  notional amount of these contracts were settled in accordance with their original maturities 
the realized gain on these contracts was also during january  we accelerated the settlement of the remaining  notional amount of forward exchange contracts that were originally scheduled to mature between february  and december  these transactions resulted in a gain of approximately that was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal we unwound these forward exchange contracts after completing a strategic review of our foreign currency exposures 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
market risk exposure foreign currency risk we have market risk exposure related to foreign currency transactions 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to our european distribution operations where the billing currency is the euro for most of our customers in these markets 
we also are exposed to foreign currency risk related to the supply of certain diagnostic test kits by manufacturers located in germany and spain 
these foreign currency risks are opposite one another  providing a natural hedge with respect to consolidated gross profit and operating income 

table of contents concentration of customers products risk our us diagnostic operating segment s sales through two distributors were of the us diagnostics operating segment s total sales or of consolidated sales for fiscal three internally developed products  premier tm platinum hpsa plus  premier tm toxins a b  and immunocard toxins a b  accounted for of our us diagnostics operating segment s third party sales during fiscal these same three products accounted for of our european diagnostics operating segment s third party sales and of our consolidated sales for fiscal our life science operating segment s sales of purified antigens and reagents to two customers were of the life science operating segment s total sales for fiscal or of our consolidated sales for fiscal our life science operating segment has two other significant customers who purchase antigens  antibodies and reagents  which together comprised of the operating segment s total sales for fiscal critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles require management to make judgments about estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
management believes that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the application of such polices requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions and the carrying values of related assets and liabilities are material 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from product sales 
revenue is generally recognized when product is shipped and title has passed to the buyer 
revenue for the us diagnostics operating segment is reduced at the date of sale for estimated rebates that will be claimed by customers 
rebate agreements are in place with certain independent national distributors and are designed to reimburse such distributors for their cost in handling our products 
we estimate rebate accruals based on historical statistics  current trends  and other factors 
changes to these rebate accruals are recorded in the period that they become known 
life science revenue for contract services may come from standalone arrangements for process development and or optimization work contract research and development services or custom manufacturing  or multiple deliverable arrangements that include process development work followed by larger scale manufacturing both contract research and development services and contract manufacturing services 
revenue is recognized based on the nature of the arrangements  with each of the multiple 
table of contents deliverables in a given arrangement having distinct and separate fair values 
fair values are determined via consistent pricing between standalone arrangements and multiple deliverable arrangements  as well as a competitive bidding process 
contract research and development services may be performed on a time and materials basis or fixed fee basis 
for time and materials arrangements  revenue is recognized as services are performed and billed 
for fixed fee arrangements  revenue is recognized upon completion and acceptance by the customer 
for contract manufacturing services  revenue is generally recognized upon delivery of product and acceptance by the customer 
in some cases  customers may request that we store on their behalf clinical grade biologicals that we produce under contract manufacturing agreements 
these cases arise when customers do not have clinical grade storage facilities or do not want to risk contamination during transport 
for such cases  revenue may be recognized on a bill and hold basis pursuant to the satisfaction of criteria in sec staff accounting bulletins nos 
and related to bill and hold revenue recognition 
inventories our inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
we establish reserves against cost for excess and obsolete materials  finished goods whose shelf life may expire before sale to customers  and other identified exposures 
management estimates these reserves based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions were to be less favorable than such estimates  additional inventory write downs would be required and recorded in the period known 
such adjustments would negatively affect gross profit margin and overall results of operations 
intangible assets our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
identifiable intangibles include customer lists  supply agreements  manufacturing technologies  patents  licenses  and trade names 
all of meridian s identifiable intangibles have finite lives 
goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review or more frequently if impairment indicators arise by applying a fair value based test 
there have been no impairments from these analyses 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are subject to impairment testing 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their current carrying value 
whether an event or circumstance triggers impairment is determined by comparing an estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value 
if impairment has occurred  it is measured by a fair value based test 
there were no events or circumstances in fiscal  or indicating that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 

table of contents our ability to recover intangible assets  both identifiable intangibles and goodwill  is dependent upon the future cash flows of the related acquired businesses and assets 
management is required to make judgments and assumptions regarding future cash flows  including sales levels  gross profit margins  operating expense levels  working capital levels  and capital expenditures 
with respect to identifiable intangibles  management also makes judgments and assumptions regarding useful lives 
management considers the following factors in evaluating events and circumstances for possible impairment i significant under performance relative to historical or projected operating results  ii negative industry trends  iii sales levels of specific groups of products related to specific identifiable intangibles  iv changes in overall business strategies and v other factors 
if actual cash flows are less favorable than projections  impairment of intangible assets could take place 
if impairment were to occur  this would negatively affect overall results of operations 
income taxes our provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state  and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between income for financial reporting purposes and income for tax purposes 
we prepare estimates of permanent and temporary differences between income for financial reporting purposes and income for tax purposes 
these differences are adjusted to actual upon filing of our tax returns  typically occurring in the third and fourth quarters of the current fiscal year for the preceding fiscal year s estimates 
our deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions 
the realization of tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions 
management assesses the level of deferred tax asset valuation allowance by taking into consideration historical and future projected operating results  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  as well as tax planning strategies 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in future years if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
undistributed earnings in our italian subsidiary are considered by management to be permanently re invested in such subsidiary 
consequently  us deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
we believe that such us taxes would be largely offset by foreign tax credits for taxes paid locally in italy 
from time to time  our tax returns in federal  state  and foreign jurisdictions are examined by the applicable tax authorities 
to the extent that adjustments result from the completion of these examinations or the lapsing of statutes of limitation  they will affect tax liabilities in the period known 
we believe that the results of any tax authority examinations would not have a significant adverse impact on financial condition or results of operation 

table of contents fair value measurements we adopted the fair value measurement as prescribed by fasb on october  to value our financial assets and liabilities 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures  a fair value hierarchy has been established by fasb that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels  which are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date for assets and liabilities 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to level inputs 
level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the assets or liabilities  either directly or indirectly 
these include quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  that is  markets in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability  the prices are not current  or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers  or in which little information is released publicly and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means 
level unobservable inputs  developed using the company s estimates and assumptions  which reflect those that the market participants would use 
such inputs are used when little or no market data is available 
the fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to level inputs 
determining where an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy depends on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole 
in determining fair value  we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in the assessment of fair value 
the failed auction status and lack of liquidity for our student loan auction rate securities and the non transferability of our ubs auction rate security rights requires the use of a valuation methodology that relies exclusively on level inputs including market  tax status  credit quality  duration  recent market observations and overall capital market liquidity 
the valuation of our student loan auction rate securities and ubs auction rate security rights is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact the valuations include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity
