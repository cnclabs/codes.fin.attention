management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results

as of march   we operated stores in alabama  florida  georgia  indiana  kentucky  north carolina  ohio  south carolina and tennessee 
hhgregg  inc was formed in delaware on april  as part of a corporate reorganization effected on july   the stockholders of gregg appliances contributed all of their shares of gregg appliances to hhgregg in exchange for common stock of hhgregg

gregg appliances consolidated financial statements are presented as historical comparisons for hhgregg prior to the date of the corporate reorganization 
this overview section is divided into four sub sections discussing our operating strategy and performance  store development strategy  business strategy and core philosophies and seasonality 
operating strategy and performance 
we focus the majority of our floor space  advertising expense and distribution infrastructure on the marketing  delivery and installation of a wide selection of premium video and appliance products 
we display over models of flat panel televisions and major appliances in our stores with an especially broad assortment of models in the middle to upper end of product price ranges 
video and appliance net sales comprised of our net sales mix in both fiscal and we strive to differentiate ourselves through our customer purchase experience starting with a highly trained  consultative commissioned sales force which educates our customers on the features and benefits of our products  followed by rapid product delivery and installation  and ending with helpful post sales support services 
we carefully monitor our competition to ensure that our prices are competitive in the market place 
our experience has been that informed customers often choose to buy a more heavily featured product once they understand the applicability and benefits of its features 
heavily featured products typically carry higher average selling prices and higher margins than less featured  entry level price point products 
the following table summarizes certain operating data that we believe are important to an understanding of our operating model fiscal year ended march  inventory turnover x x x working capital as a percentage of sales net capital expenditures as a percentage of sales income from operations as a percentage of sales inventory turnover for the specified period is calculated by dividing our cost of goods sold for the fiscal year by the average of the beginning and ending inventory for that period 
working capital represents current assets excluding cash  deposits and the current portion of deferred income taxes less current liabilities as of the end of the respective fiscal year end  expressed as a percentage of sales 
net capital expenditures represent capital expenditures less proceeds from sale and leaseback transactions  expressed as a percentage of sales 
we focus on leveraging our semi fixed expenditures in advertising  distribution and regional management through closely managing our inventory  working capital and store development expenditures 
our inventory has averaged turns per year over the past three fiscal years 
our working capital has averaged  expressed as a percentage of sales  over the past three fiscal years 
our net capital expenditures have averaged  measured as a percentage of sales  over the past three fiscal years 
these factors  combined with our strong store level profitability  have contributed to the generation of significant free cash flow over the past three fiscal years 
this has enabled us to de leverage our balance sheet and internally fund our store growth 
store development strategy 
over the past several years  we have adhered closely to a development strategy of adding stores to metropolitan markets in clusters to achieve rapid market share penetration and more efficiently leverage our distribution network  advertising and regional management costs 
our expansion plans include looking for new markets where we believe there is significant underlying demand for stores  typically in areas that demonstrate above 
table of contents average economic growth  strong household incomes and growth in new housing starts and or remodeling activity 
our markets typically include most or all of our major competitors 
we plan to continue to follow our approach of building store density in each major market and distribution area  which in the past has helped us to improve our market share and realize operating efficiencies 
during fiscal  we opened a net total of new stores of which were opened in new markets 
the new markets included jacksonville  florida and orlando  florida 
during the past twelve months  we also opened a new regional distribution center in jacksonville  florida  and a third central distribution center in davenport  florida to support our growth plans 
business strategy and core philosophies 
our business strategy is focused around offering our customers a superior customer purchase experience 
from the time the customers walk in the door  they will experience a well designed  customer friendly store 
our stores are brightly lit and have clearly distinguished departments that allow our customers to find what they are looking for 
we greet and assist our customers with our highly trained consultative sales force  who are there to educate the consumers about the different product features 
our products are rich in features and innovations and are ever changing 
we find that customers find it helpful to have someone explain the products features and benefits 
we believe this assistance allows them the opportunity to buy the product that most closely matches their needs 
we follow up on the customer purchase experience by offering same day delivery on many of our products and a high quality  in home installation service 
we offer all of this at a competitive price  under our philosophy  price and advice  guaranteed 
the consumer electronics industry depends on new products to drive sales and profitability 
innovative  heavily featured products are typically introduced at relatively high price points 
over time  price points are gradually reduced to drive consumption 
for example  as prices for large flat panel high definition television products fall below the  range  more of our customers purchase them 
there has been price compression in flat panel televisions for equivalent screen sizes over the past few years 
according to display search  television sales are expected to fall this calendar year and sales of flat panel televisions are expected to decrease  largely as a function of declining average selling prices 
as with similar product life cycles for console televisions  vhs recorders and large screen projection televisions  we have responded to this risk by shifting our sales mix to focus on newer  higher margin items such as led technology  with an increased focus and selection on larger screen sizes 
according to the consumer electronics associations  or the cea  sales for consumer electronics are expected to decrease but units are expected to increase from video gaming  blu ray players  notebook computers  and camcorders are all categories which are expected to have growth in sales in according to the cea 
in the past  certain product innovations in certain consumer electronic product categories such as laptop computers  camcorders and audio products  have not been sufficient to maintain average selling prices 
these mature products have become commoditized and have experienced price declines and reduced margins 
as certain of our products become commodities  we focus on selling the next generation of these affected products  carefully managing the depth and breadth of commoditized products that we offer and introducing all together new product lines that are complementary to our existing product mix 
the appliance industry has benefited greatly from increased innovation in energy efficient products 
while these energy efficient products typically carry a higher average selling price than traditional products  they save the consumer significant dollars in annual energy savings 
additionally  form and aesthetics have become an increasingly important factor in major appliance purchase decisions 
accordingly  the rise in average unit selling prices of major appliances from which we have benefited for the past four fiscal years is not expected to change dramatically for the foreseeable future 
conversely  retail appliance sales are highly correlated to the housing industry and housing turnover 
as more people purchase existing homes in the market  appliance sales tend to trend upward 
as the recent demand in the housing 
table of contents market has been relatively low  our appliance sales traffic has suffered significantly 
the association of home appliance manufacturers reported that shipments of major appliances fell for the three months ended march  management does not expect this trend in appliance traffic to substantially improve until the housing market begins to turn positive 
seasonality 
our business is seasonal  with a higher portion of net sales and operating profit realized during the quarter that ends december due to the overall demand for consumer electronics during the holiday shopping season 
appliance revenue is impacted by seasonal weather patterns but is less seasonal than our electronics business and helps to offset the seasonality of our overall business 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with us gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material
