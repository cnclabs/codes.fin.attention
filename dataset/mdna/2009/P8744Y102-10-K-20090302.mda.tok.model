item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview steiner leisure limited is a leading worldwide provider of spa services 
we operate our business through three reportable segments spa operations  products and schools 
through our spa operations segment  we offer massages and a variety of other body treatments  as well as a broad variety of beauty treatments to women  men and teenagers on cruise ships and at resort spas and two day spas 
in connection with these services  we have assisted in the design of facilities for many of the ships and resorts that we serve 
we conduct our activities pursuant to agreements with cruise lines and resort owners that  generally  give us the exclusive right to offer these types of services at those venues 
the cruise lines and resort owners  generally  receive compensation based on a percentage of our revenues at these respective locations and  in certain cases  a minimum annual rental or combination of both 
as of february   we provided our spa services on ships and at a total of resorts located in the united states  the caribbean  asia  the pacific and other locations  and at our elemis luxury day spas in coral gables  florida and london  england 
through our products segment  we develop and sell a variety of high quality beauty products under our elemis and la therapie brands  and also sell products of third parties 
the raw materials for the products we develop are produced for us by a premier european manufacturer 
we sell our products at our shipboard and land based spas pursuant to the same agreements under which we provide spa services at those locations  as well as through third party outlets 
we believe that having our products featured at our luxury spas at sea and on land has assisted us in securing other distribution channels for our products 
through our schools segment  we own and operate five post secondary schools comprised of a total of campuses located in arizona  colorado  connecticut  florida  maryland  nevada  pennsylvania  utah and virginia 
these schools offer programs in massage therapy and  in some cases  beauty and skin care  and train and qualify spa professionals for health and beauty positions  including  in some cases  within the steiner family of companies 
among other things  we train the students at our schools in the use of our elemis and la therapie products 
we offer full time programs as well as part time programs for students who work or who otherwise desire to take classes outside traditional education hours 
as of february   there were a total of  students attending our schools 
revenues from our massage and beauty schools  which consist almost entirely of student tuition payments  are derived to a significant extent from the proceeds of loans issued under the doe s title i v program and  accordingly  we must comply with a number of regulatory requirements in order to maintain the eligibility of our students and prospective students for loans under this program 
our revenues are generated principally from our cruise ship operations 
accordingly  our success and our growth are dependent to a significant extent on the success and growth of the travel and leisure industry in general  and on the cruise industry in particular 
our resort spas are dependent on the resort hotel industry for their success 
these industries are subject to significant risks that could affect our results of operations 
the success of the cruise and resort industries  as well as our business  is impacted by economic conditions 
the overall weakness in the us where a significant portion of our shipboard and land based spa customers reside and other world economies  which began in  including increased unemployment  and the problems in the credit and capital markets  have created a challenging environment for the cruise and resort industries and our business  including our retail beauty products sales 
the impact on consumers of high fuel costs which softened somewhat in the second half of has added to this turmoil 
high fuel costs also increase our product delivery and employee travel costs 
these conditions have impacted consumer confidence and placed considerable negative pressure on discretionary consumer spending  including spending on cruise and resort vacations and our services and products 
as a consequence of these economic conditions  our results of operations and financia l condition for the third and fourth quarters of were adversely affected and the continuation or worsening of these conditions would likely continue to adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition during the period of such continuation or worsening 
if the current weak economic environment continues for an extended period of time or worsens  spending on cruise and resort vacations and on beauty products would likely continue to be adversely affected 
this could materially  adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other factors also can adversely affect our financial results 
the us dollar has been weak in recent years against the uk pound sterling and the euro 
this weakness affected our results of operations because we pay for the administration of recruitment and training of our shipboard personnel and the manufacturing of raw materials and of our products in uk pounds sterling and euros 
the uk dollar strengthened significantly in the second half of  favorably affecting our results  however  to the extent that the uk pound sterling or the euro again becomes stronger against the us dollar  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
a significant factor in our financial results is the amounts we are required to pay under our agreements with the cruise lines and resorts we serve 
certain cruise line agreements provide for increases in percentages of revenues and other amounts payable by us over the terms of those agreements 
these payments also may be increased under new agreements with cruise lines and resort venue operators that replace expiring agreements 
in general  we have experienced increases in these payments as a percentage of revenues upon entering into new agreements with cruise lines 
weather also can impact our results 
the multiple destructive hurricanes that hit the southern united states and other regions several years ago caused cancellation or disruption of certain cruises and the closure of certain of our resort spas and campuses of our massage and beauty schools  which had adverse effects on us 
in addition  the strong tsunami that hit various asian regions in december resulted in damage to  and the closing of  most of our operations in the maldives during much of in  we closed two campuses of ucmt for several days due to severe snow conditions and ccmt also has experienced closures as a result of snow conditions 
historically  a significant portion of our operations has been conducted on ships through entities that are not subject to income taxation in the united states or other jurisdictions 
to the extent that our non shipboard income increases as a percentage of our overall income  the percentage of our overall income that will be subject to tax would increase 
an increasing amount of revenues have come from our sales of products through third party retail outlets  our web sites  mail order and other channels 
however  as our product sales grow  continued increases in the rate of such growth are more difficult to attain 
in addition  an increasing percentage of cruise passengers who use our services are repeat customers of ours 
these repeat customers are less likely to purchase our products than new customers 
key performance indicators spa operations 
a measure of performance we have used in connection with our periodic financial disclosure relating to our cruise line operations is that of revenue per staff per day 
in using that measure  we have differentiated between our revenue per staff per day on ships with large spas and other ships we serve 
our revenue per staff per day has been affected by the increasing requirements of cruise lines that we place additional non revenue producing staff on ships with large spas to help maintain a high quality guest experience 
we also utilize  as a measure of performance for our cruise line operations  our average revenue per week 
we use these measures of performance because they assist us in determining the productivity of our staff  which we believe is a critical element of our operations 
with respect to our resort spas  we measure our performance primarily through average weekly revenue over applicable periods of time 
schools 
with respect to our massage and beauty schools  we measure performance primarily by the number of new student enrollments and the rate of retention of our students 
a new student enrollment occurs each time a new student commences classes at one of our schools 
products 
with respect to sales of our products  other than on cruise ships and at our resort and day spas  we measure performance by revenues 
growth we seek to grow our business by attempting to obtain contracts for new cruise ships brought into service by our existing cruise line customers and for existing and new ships of other cruise lines  seeking new venues for our resort spas  developing new products and services  seeking additional channels for the distribution of our retail products and seeking to increase the student enrollments at our post secondary massage and beauty schools 
we also consider growth  among other things  through appropriate strategic transactions  including acquisitions and joint ventures 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
this discussion is not intended to be a comprehensive description of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the impact on our business operations and any associated risks related to these policies is discussed under results of operations  below  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  please see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of asset s and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
cost of revenues includes cost of services  including an allocable portion of wages paid to shipboard employees  an allocable portion of payments to cruise lines  an allocable portion of staff related shipboard expenses  wages paid directly to land based spa employees  payments to land based spa venue owners  spa facilities depreciation  as well as  with respect to our schools  directly attributable campus costs such as rent  advertising and employee wages  and cost of products  including an allocable portion of wages paid to shipboard employees  an allocable portion of payments to cruise lines  an allocable portion of other staff related shipboard expenses  as well as costs associated with development  manufacturing and distribution of products 
the allocations discussed above are based on the portion of maritime revenues represented by product or service revenues 
cost of revenues may be affected by  among other things  sales mix  production levels  exchange rates  changes in supplier prices and discounts  purchasing and manufacturing efficiencies  tariffs  duties  freight and inventory costs 
certain cruise line and land based spa agreements provide for increases in the percentages of services and products revenues and or  as the case may be  the amount of minimum annual payments over the terms of those agreements 
these payments may also be increased under new agreements with cruise lines and resort spa and day spa venue owners that replace expiring agreements 
cost of products includes the cost of products sold through our various methods of distribution 
to a lesser extent  cost of products also includes the cost of products consumed in rendering services 
this amount is not a material component of the cost of services rendered and would not be practicable to identify separately 
operating expenses include administrative expenses  salary and payroll taxes 
in addition  operating expenses include amortization of certain intangibles relating to our acquisitions of resort spas in  ucmt in april and ccmt in august revenue recognition we do not have critical accounting policies with respect to revenue recognition other than with respect to our massage therapy and beauty schools 
tuition revenue and revenue related to certain nonrefundable fees and charges at our massage and beauty schools are recognized monthly on a straight line basis over the term of the course of study 
at the time a student begins attending a school  a liability unearned tuition is recorded for all academic services to be provided and a tuition receivable is recorded for the portion of the tuition not paid up front in cash 
revenue related to sales of program materials  books and supplies are  generally  recognized when the program materials  books and supplies are delivered 
we include the revenue related to sales of program materials  books and supplies in the services revenue financial statement caption in our consolidated statement of income 
if a student withdraws from one of our schools prior to the completion of the academic te rm  we refund the portion of the tuition already paid that  pursuant to our refund policy and applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards  we are not entitled to retain 
allowance for doubtful accounts we do not have critical accounting policies with respect to allowance for doubtful accounts other than with respect to our massage therapy and beauty schools 
we extend unsecured credit to our students for tuition and fees and we record a receivable for the tuition and fees earned in excess of the payment received from or on behalf of a student 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to accounts receivable using historical collection experience 
we review the historical collection experience  consider other facts and circumstances  and adjust the calculation to record an allowance for doubtful accounts as appropriate 
if our current collection trends were to differ significantly from our historic collection experience  however  we would make a corresponding adjustment to our allowance 
we write off the accounts receivable due from former students when we conclude that collection is not probable 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is recorded using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets in question 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
for certain properties  leasehold improvements are amortized over lease terms  which include renewal periods that may be obtained at our option and that are considered significant to the continuation of our operations and to the existence of leasehold improvements  the value of which would be impaired if we discontinued our use of the leased property 
we perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes 
the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset  industry practice and asset maintenance policies 
maintenance and repair items are expensed as incurred 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  based on estimated future cash flows  that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
in certain cases  the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the assets in question 
goodwill and intangibles pursuant to sfas  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value 
as of december   we had goodwill of million and unamortized intangibles of million 
as of january   we performed the required annual goodwill impairment test and determined there was no impairment of goodwill 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax exposure together with an assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax purposes and accounting purposes  respectively 
these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in our consolidated statement of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize certain of our deferred income tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred income tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
contingent rents and scheduled rent increases our resort spas  generally  are required to pay rent based on a percentage of our revenues 
in addition  for certain of our resort spas  we are required to pay a minimum rental amount regardless of whether such amount would be required to be paid under the percentage rent agreement 
rent escalations are recorded on a straight line basis over the term of the lease agreement 
we record contingent rent at the time it becomes probable that it will exceed the minimum rent obligation per the lease agreement 
previously recognized rental expense is reversed into income at such time that it is not probable that the specified target will be met 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a formal framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements with respect to fair value measurements 
sfas applies prospectively to fair value measurements performed after the required effective dates as follows on january   the standard applied to the measurements of fair values of financial instruments and recurring fair value measurements of non financial assets and liabilities  as of january   the standard applied to non recurring measurements of non financial assets and liabilities such as our measurement of potential impairments of goodwill  other intangibles and other long lived assets 
as of january   we adopted the provisions of sfas for our measurement of fair value of financial instruments and recurring fair value measurements of non financial assets and liabilities 
the adoption of th ese provisions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect the adoption of the remaining provisions of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement sfas

we have experienced varying degrees of seasonality  due to the seasonality experienced by certain cruise lines  as the demand for cruises is stronger in the northern hemisphere during the summer months and during holidays  resulting in the third quarter being the strongest quarter for us 
our product sales generally are strongest in the fourth quarter as a result of the december holiday shopping period 
however  during the third and fourth quarters of  our revenues were lower than those of the first two quarters as a result of the worsening economic condition in the united states and elsewhere 
the quarterly selected statements of income data set forth below were derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of steiner leisure which  in the opinion of our management  contain all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of those statements

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or to obtain cash 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows generated from operating activities and  in connection with major acquisitions  financing provided by our revolving credit facility 
we believe that cash generated from operations is sufficient to satisfy the cash required to operate our current business for at least the next months 
however  if the recession in the overall economy and the leisure industry continues  our operating cash flow and the availability and cost of capital for our business will be adversely affected 
in addition  depending on the longevity and ultimate severity of the current deterioration of the global economy  including financial and credit markets  our ability to grow or sustain our business operations may be significantly adversely affected 
also  as a result of concerns about the general stability of financial markets  the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets has increased  as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  imposed tighter lending standards  refused to refinance existing debt at maturity at all or on terms similar to existing debt or at all  and reduced and  in some cases  ceased to provide any new funding 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that funding in excess of that available through our working capital and current credit agreement will be available to the extent required and on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to access funding when needed on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fully implement our business plans  consummate acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities  respond to competitive pressures or refinance any debt obligations that we may incur  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
sources and uses of cash during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income and changes in working capital items 
during the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million compared with million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributed to our incurring less capital expenditures to build out resort spa facilities in as compared to the decrease was partially offset by the expenditures incurred in connection with the acquisition of ccmt 
during the year ended december   cash used in financing activities was million  compared with million for the year ended december  included in the amount is cash used to purchase approximately million of our shares  compared with million used to purchase our shares in those payments were offset by the receipt of approximately million  representing the exercise price of common share options exercised during compared to million received from such exercises in those payments also were offset by million of borrowings under our revolving line of credit during we had working capital of approximately million at december   compared to working capital of approximately million at december  in the fourth quarter of  we decided to dispose of  or otherwise close  of the day spas we then operated due to their underperformance 
the remaining day spa was located at a hotel and now operates as part of our resort spa operations 
as of april   all of those day spas had been closed or otherwise disposed of pursuant to agreements with landlords and or  in some cases  agreements with third party acquirers of the spas assets  including the leases 
some of these transactions involved our paying to those landlords amounts representing various portions of the remaining terms of the leases involved 
in the transactions involving transfers of spa assets and assignments of the leases  we typically were required to make payments to those acquirers in consideration of their assuming both the lease in question and certain gift certificate liabilities related to the spas in question 
the lease assignments to third parties generally do not include a release from the land lords of the spas in question and  accordingly  to the extent that these third parties fail to pay rent under the leases  we remain liable for that rent 
we would  in those instances  have a cause of action for such rental amounts against those third parties 
we remain liable for approximately million as of december  under these assigned leases to the extent the assignees fail to make their rental payments 
we purchased a total of  of our common shares from february through may under our previously adopted share repurchase plan 
in a series of three actions in june  june and july  respectively  our board authorized the purchase of a total of an additional  shares 
during  we purchased approximately  shares for a total of approximately million 
during  we purchased approximately  shares for a total of approximately million 
in july  our board approved the purchase of an additional  shares in the open market or other transactions 
during  we purchased approximately  shares for a total of approximately million 
in february  our board approved a new share repurchase plan under which up to million of common shares can be purchased and terminated the prior plan 
during  we purchased  of our shares for a total of approximately million 
during  i n connection with employee related transactions outside our share repurchase program   shares were surrendered by our employees in connection with tax payments related to the vesting of such restricted shares 
all of these purchases were funded from our working capital 
as of february   there remained approximately million authorized for purchase under our share repurchase plan 
we cannot provide assurance as to the number of additional shares  if any  that will be purchased under our share repurchase plan 
financing activities in july  we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provided for a term loan of million and a revolving credit facility of up to million 
we repaid all outstanding amounts due under our former term loan and the revolving credit facility in on june   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with one of the banks in the original syndicate 
the terms and conditions of the new agreement are substantially the same as the former agreement  except that there is no term loan component and the aggregate amount available for borrowing under the revolving line of credit was increased from million to million and the maturity date of the revolving facility was extended two years to july  in  the revolving line of credit was increased to million 
effective june   we entered into a second amended agreement which extend the maturity date of the revolving facility by three years to july  borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest primarily at london interbank offered rate libor based rates plus a spread that is dependent upon our financial performance 
as of december   there was million available under the revolving facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had million outstanding under our revolving line of credit 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives based upon market conditions 
our objective in managing the exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we have used interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes to our borrowings 
these swaps are typically entered into with a group of financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby reducing the risk of credit loss 
while our revenues and expenses are primarily represented by us dollars  they also are represented by various other currencies  primarily the uk pound sterling 
accordingly  we face the risk of fluctuations in non us currencies compared to non us dollars 
we manage this currency risk by monitoring fluctuations in foreign currencies and  when exchange rates are appropriate  purchasing amounts of those foreign currencies 
a hypothetical change in the exchange rate of the uk pound sterling to the uk dollar as of december  would change our results of operations by approximately million
