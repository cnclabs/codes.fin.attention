government regulation most of our health and well being services are regulated by federal and state regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
this regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
federal and state governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system  including proposals to address the affordability and availability of health insurance and to reduce the number of uninsured individuals 
the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically 
new laws  regulations and rules  or changes in the interpretation of existing laws  regulations and rules  could negatively impact our business 
we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws  regulations and rules 
in the event we fail to comply with federal and state regulations  or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to health care reforms and frequent changes in federal and state regulations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see item a  risk factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with federal and state government regulations 
federal laws and regulation we are subject to various levels of federal regulation 
ovations and americhoice medicare and medicaid businesses are regulated by cms

in addition  the portion of ingenix s business that includes clinical research is subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration 
we are also affected by laws and regulations relating to consumer protection  anti fraud and abuse  anti kickbacks  anti money laundering  securities and antitrust 
hipaa  glba and other privacy and security regulation 
the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of  as amended hipaa  apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets  including self funded employee benefit plans 
hipaa requires guaranteed health care coverage for small employers and certain eligible individuals 
it also requires guaranteed renewability for employers and individuals and limits exclusions based on preexisting conditions 
federal regulations 
table of contents promulgated pursuant to hipaa include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets  and for the privacy and security of protected health information 
the hipaa privacy regulations do not preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may also apply to us 
federal privacy and security requirements change frequently as a result of legislation  regulations and judicial or administrative interpretation 
the us congress is currently considering new privacy and security legislation 
some of the proposed changes include new contracting requirements for hipaa business associate agreements  new agreements for covered entities logging disclosures for treatment  payment and health care operations  hipaa business associates being subject to most parts of the hipaa security rule  and certain limitations on receiving direct or indirect remuneration for the exchange of health information 
federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personal identifiable information 
the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses is also regulated in some instances by other federal laws  including the gramm leach bliley act glba or state statutes implementing glba  which generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party  and which generally require safeguards for the protection of personal information 
see item a  risk factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with hipaa  glba and other privacy related regulations 
erisa 
the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employer sponsored health benefit plans 
erisa is a set of laws and regulations subject to periodic interpretation by the us department of labor as well as the federal courts 
erisa places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans  particularly those that maintain self funded plans 
regulations established by the us department of labor provide additional rules for claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by erisa 
recent final and proposed regulations would require additional disclosures to employers of certain types of indirect compensation we receive 
additionally  some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for health care plans 
fdic 
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic has federal regulatory and supervisory authority over optumhealth bank and performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements 
in addition to such annual examinations  the fdic performs periodic examinations of the bank s compliance with applicable federal banking statutes  regulations and agency guidelines 
in the event of unfavorable examination results  the bank could be subjected to increased operational expenses  governmental oversight and monetary penalties 
state laws and regulation health care regulation 
our insurance and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business 
all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and hmo products regulate those products and operations 
these states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements 
with the amendment of the annual financial reporting model regulation by the national association of insurance commissioners to incorporate elements of the sarbanes oxley act of  we expect that these states will continue to expand the regulations of corporate governance and internal control activities of hmos and insurance companies 
health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations 
such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and general business operations 
some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets  as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates 
these laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends 

table of contents in addition  some of our business and related activities may be subject to other health care related regulations and requirements  including ppo  managed care organization mco  utilization review ur or third party administrator related regulations and licensure requirements 
these regulations differ from state to state  but may contain network  contracting  product and rate  and financial and reporting requirements 
there are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services  payment of claims  adequacy of health care professional networks  fraud prevention  protection of consumer health information  pricing and underwriting practices  and covered benefits and services 
state health care anti fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities  including kickbacks for referral of members  billing unnecessary medical services  and improper marketing 
our americhoice and ovations medicaid businesses are subject to regulation by state medicaid agencies that oversee the provision of benefits by americhoice to its medicaid and schip beneficiaries and by ovations to its medicaid beneficiaries 
we also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award  administration and performance of state government contracts 
pharmacy regulation 
prescription solutions mail order pharmacies must be licensed to do business as a pharmacy in the state in which they are located 
our mail order pharmacies must also register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances 
many of the states where our mail order pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals have laws and regulations that require out of state mail order pharmacies to register with that state s board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body 
these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located  although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state 
our mail order pharmacies maintain certain medicare and state medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs 
participation in these programs require the pharmacies to comply with the applicable medicare and medicaid provider rules and regulations 
other laws and regulations affecting our mail order pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling  packaging  advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances 
see item a  risk factors for a discussion of the risks related to our pbm businesses 
privacy and security laws 
states have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the glba 
like hipaa  glba allows states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection 
a number of states have also adopted other laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and security practices  for example  state laws that govern the use  disclosure  and protection of social security numbers 
state and local authorities are increasingly focused on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft  with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information 
state consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personal identifiable information 
additionally  different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines 
see item a  risk factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy related regulations 
udfi 
in addition  the utah state department of financial institutions udfi has state regulatory and supervisory authority over optumhealth bank and in conjunction with federal regulators performs annual examinations to ensure that the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements 
in addition to such annual examinations  the udfi in conjunction with federal regulators performs periodic examinations of the bank s compliance with applicable state banking statutes  regulations and agency guidelines 
in the event of unfavorable examination results  the bank could be subjected to increased operational expenses  governmental oversight and monetary penalties 
commitments 
in connection with the pacificare health systems  inc pacificare and sierra health services  inc sierra acquisitions  which closed in december and february  respectively  as typically occurs in connection with comparable sized transactions  certain of our subsidiaries entered into various commitments with state regulatory departments  principally in california and nevada 
we believe that none of these commitments will materially affect our operations

these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance and health and welfare departments  state attorneys general  the office of the inspector general  the office of personnel management  the office of civil rights  us congressional committees  the us department of justice  us attorneys  the sec  the internal revenue service and other governmental authorities 
such government actions can result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs

competition as a diversified health and well being services company  we operate in highly competitive markets 
our competitors include managed health care companies  insurance companies  third party administrators and business services outsourcing companies  health care professionals that have formed networks to directly contract with employers or with cms  specialty benefit providers  government entities  disease management companies  and various health information and consulting companies 
for our health care services businesses  competitors include aetna inc  cigna corporation  coventry health care  inc  health net  inc  humana inc  kaiser permanente  wellpoint  inc  numerous for profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas 
for our prescription solutions businesses  competitors include medco health solutions  inc  cvs caremark corporation  and express scripts  inc our optumhealth and ingenix reporting segments also compete with a number of other businesses 
new entrants into the markets in which we compete  as well as consolidation within these markets  also contribute to a competitive environment 
we believe the principal competitive factors that can impact our businesses relate to the sales  marketing and pricing of our products and services  product innovation  consumer satisfaction  the level and quality of products and services  care delivery  network capabilities  market share  product distribution systems  efficiency of administration operations  financial strength and marketplace reputation 
if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share  including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected

risk factors cautionary statements the statements  estimates  projections  guidance or outlook contained in this annual report on form k include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra 
when used in this annual report on form k and in future filings by us with the sec  in our news releases  presentations to securities analysts or investors  and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers  the words or phrases believe  expect  intend  estimate  anticipate  plan  project  should or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider 
we do not undertake to address or update forward looking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results  and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications 
in addition  any of the matters discussed below may have affected past  as well as current  forward looking statements about future results 
any or all forward looking statements in this form k and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate 
table of contents assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results 
by their nature  forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify 
actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications 
if we fail to effectively estimate  price for and manage our health care costs  the profitability of our risk based products could decline and could materially adversely affect our future financial results 
under our risk based product arrangements  we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums 
premium revenues from risk based products comprise approximately of our total consolidated revenues 
we generally use approximately to of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers 
the profitability of our risk based products depends in large part on our ability to predict  price for  and effectively manage health care costs 
we manage health care costs through underwriting criteria  product design  negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs 
total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service 
our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically fixed for a month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences 
our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june the year before the contract year 
we base the premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed contract period  however  medical cost inflation  regulation and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums or bids 
these factors may include increased use of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use 
as a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results  relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results 
for example  if medical costs increased by without a proportional change in related revenues for commercial insured products  our annual net earnings for would have been reduced by approximately million 
in addition  the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding 
these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment 
if these estimates prove too low  they will have a negative impact on our future results 
if we fail to comply with federal and state regulations  or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to health care reforms and frequent changes in federal and state regulations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business is regulated at the federal  state  local and international levels 
the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
the broad latitude that is given to the agencies administering those regulations  as well as future laws and rules  could force us to change how we do business  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements  and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations  contract interpretation and other actions 
see item  business government regulation for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our businesses 
we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products  to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions  including integration of certain acquisitions 
delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs 
legislative proposals that would reform the health care system have been advanced by congress and state legislatures and are currently pending at the state and federal levels 
these changes include policy changes that 
table of contents would fundamentally change the dynamics of our industry  such as having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care industry or a fundamental restructuring of the medicare or medicaid programs 
these proposals may also affect certain aspects of our business  including contracting with physicians  hospitals and or other health care professionals  physician reimbursement methods and payment rates  coverage determinations  mandated benefits  minimum medical expenditures  claim payments and processing  drug utilization and patient safety efforts  collection  use  disclosure  maintenance and disposal of individually identifiable health information  personal health records  consumer driven health plans and health savings accounts and insurance market reforms  and government sponsored programs 
for example  the new administration and various congressional leaders have signaled their interest in reducing payments to private plans offering medicare advantage 
depending on the extent and phasing of these potential reductions  the number of seniors participating in medicare advantage and the industry wide earnings derived from these plans may fall 
in addition  massachusetts has enacted comprehensive reform  including an individual health coverage mandate coupled with an employer mandate and a new state connector authority 
a number of other state legislatures  including california  colorado  new york  ohio and pennsylvania  have contemplated but have not enacted significant reform of their health insurance markets 
other states are expected to consider these types of reforms as well as more modest reforms aimed at expanding medicaid and or schip eligibility as well as new coverage options for those not eligible for government programs 
these proposals include provisions affecting both public programs and privately financed health insurance arrangements 
states also are considering proposals that would reform the underwriting and marketing practices of individual and group health insurance products by  for example  placing restrictions on rating and pricing and mandating minimum medical benefit cost ratios 
in addition  from time to time  congress has considered various forms of managed care reform legislation which if adopted  could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under erisa 
additionally  there is legislative interest in modifying erisa s preemptive effect on state laws 
if adopted  such limitations could increase our liability exposure and could permit greater state regulation of our operations 
we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become law  or  if enacted  what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be  but their enactment could increase our costs  expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business 
in addition  our operating results could be adversely affected by such changes even if we correctly predict their occurrence 
in addition  the health care industry is subject to negative publicity 
negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices  which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services  requiring us to change our products and services  or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate 
in august  we entered into a multi state national agreement with regulatory offices in states and the district of columbia relating to the legacy unitedhealthcare fully insured commercial business 
the agreement covers several key areas of review of our business operations  including claims payment accuracy and timeliness  appeals and grievances resolution timeliness  health care professional network service  utilization review  explanation of benefits accuracy  and oversight and due diligence of contracted entities and vendor performance 
the agreement addressed and resolved past regulatory matters related to the areas of review prior to august and establishes a transparent framework for evaluating and regulating performance through december on a prospective basis  the agreement is similar to a customer performance guarantee  whereby we will self report quarterly and annually our operational performance on a set of national performance standards agreed to by the participating states 
we must perform to the standards set forth in the agreement  or be subject to fines and penalties 
we are also involved in various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
these regulatory activities include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance and health and 
table of contents welfare departments and state attorneys general  the office of the inspector general  the office of personnel management  the office of civil rights  the us department of justice  us attorneys  the sec  the irs  the us department of labor and other governmental authorities 
for example  in  the california department of insurance examined the company s pacificare health insurance plan in california 
the examination findings related to claims processing accuracy and timeliness  accurate and timely interest payments  timely implementation of provider contracts  timely  accurate provider dispute resolution  and other related matters 
to date  the california department of insurance has not levied a financial penalty related to its findings 
the company is working closely with the department to resolve any outstanding issues arising from the findings of its examination 
in addition  the us department of labor is conducting an investigation of our administration of our employee benefit plans with respect to erisa compliance 
reviews and investigations of this sort can lead to government actions  which can result in the assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business  loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs  and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
in addition  public perception or publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations may adversely affect our stock price  damage our reputation in various markets or make it more difficult for us to sell products and services 
adverse conditions in the global economy and extreme disruption of financial markets could adversely affect our revenues  sources of liquidity  investment portfolio and our results of operations 
as widely reported  worldwide financial markets have been experiencing extreme disruption  including volatility in the prices of securities and severely diminished liquidity and availability of credit 
these extreme events  along with a recession  inflation or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions  could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
for example  higher unemployment rates and significant employment layoffs and downsizings could lead to lower enrollment in our employer group plans  lower enrollment in our non employer individual plans and a higher number of employees opting out of our employer group plans 
the adverse economic conditions could also cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary  employee funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs 
in addition  the economic downturn could negatively impact our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to increase premiums and could result in cancellation of products and services by our customers 
all of these could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  a prolonged economic downturn could negatively impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers and therefore could adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs 
during a prolonged economic downturn  state and federal budgets could be adversely affected  resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs  including medicare  medicaid and schip 
a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated and or received from the government and could adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
in addition  the state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs  such as premium taxes on health maintenance organizations and surcharges on select fee for service and capitated medical claims  and could adversely affect our results of operations 
the current economic crisis is causing contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace 
while our largest source of funding has historically been cash flow from operations  the commercial paper markets have been a source of liquidity for us and we continue to issue commercial paper  although at higher interest rates as a result of the diminished availability of credit 
however  there can be no assurance that the commercial paper 
table of contents markets will continue to be a reliable source of short term financing 
if the commercial paper markets are unavailable or not cost effective  we would use cash on hand and or draw on our contractually committed revolving credit facilities to refinance the commercial paper when it matures 
however  there can be no assurance that  under extreme market conditions  such sources would be available or sufficient 
in addition  if the global capital markets continue to deteriorate  including if more financial institutions and companies file for bankruptcy protection  or are taken over by governmental authorities  and if the prices of securities continue to deteriorate and experience extreme volatility  our investment portfolio may be impacted 
some of our investments could further experience other than temporary declines in fair value  requiring us to record an impairment charge that could adversely impact our financial results 
our businesses providing pbm services are subject to federal and state regulations associated with the pbm industry and if we fail to comply with these regulations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we provide pbm services through our prescription solutions and unitedhealthcare businesses 
each business is subject to federal and state anti kickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers  customers and consumers 
in addition  federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices  including the receipt or required disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies 
see item  business government regulation for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our pbm businesses 
in the event a court were to determine that one of our pbm businesses acts as a fiduciary under erisa  we could be subject to claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations in implementation of formularies  preferred drug listings and drug management programs  contracting network practices  specialty drug distribution and other transactions 
our pbm businesses also conduct business as mail order pharmacies  which subjects them to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations 
the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our pbm subsidiaries to civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  we would be adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacies  including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products 
further  our pbm businesses are subject to the payment card industry data security standards  which is a multifaceted security standard that includes requirements for security management  policies  procedures  network architecture  software design and other critical protective measures to protect customer account data as mandated by the credit card brands 
the failure to adhere to such standards could expose our pbm subsidiaries to liability or impact their ability to process credit card transactions 
if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share  including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our businesses compete throughout the united states and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate 
we compete with other companies on the basis of many factors  including price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives  location and choice of health care providers  quality of customer service  comprehensiveness of coverage offered  reputation for quality care  financial stability and diversity of product offerings 
for our health care services reporting segment  competitors include aetna inc  cigna corporation  coventry health care  inc  health net  inc  humana inc  kaiser permanente  wellpoint  inc  numerous for profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas or market segments such as medicare specialty services 
for our prescription solutions business  competitors include medco health solutions  inc  cvs caremark corporation and express scripts  inc our optumhealth and ingenix reporting segments also compete with a number of other businesses 

table of contents we believe that barriers to entry in many markets are not substantial  so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily  and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors 
in particular markets  competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage 
greater market share  established reputation  superior supplier or health care professional arrangements  existing business relationships  and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate  both as to our competitors and suppliers including hospitals  physician groups and other care professionals in these industries 
consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers  to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers  or to maintain or advance profitability 
if we do not compete effectively in our markets  if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets  if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively  if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services  if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect  if membership or demand for other services declines  or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
as a payer in various government health care programs  we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding  enrollments  payment adjustments and audits that could adversely affect our revenues  cash flows and financial results 
we participate in various federal  state and local government health care coverage programs  including as a payer in medicare advantage  medicare part d  various medicaid programs and schip  and receive revenues from these programs 
these programs generally are subject to frequent changes  including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past  and may do so in the future 
our participation in the medicare advantage  medicare part d  and various medicaid programs and schip occurs through bids that are submitted periodically 
revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms 
funding for these government programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control  including general economic conditions at the federal or applicable state level  and general political issues and priorities 
a reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs  including determining payments by considering the risk status of our medicare members as supported by provider medical record documentation 
federal regulators audit the supporting documents and can revise payments based on the audit findings 
cms announced in that it will perform audits of selected medicare health plans each year to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by care providers 
these audits involve a review of medical records maintained by providers  including those in and out of network  and may result in retrospective or prospective adjustments to payments made to health plans pursuant to cms medicare contracts 
certain of our plans have been selected for audit 
the first audits focused on medical records supporting risk adjustment data for that were used to determine payment amounts 
we are unable to predict the outcome of the audits 
however  a material adjustment could have a material effect on our financial results 
our ability to retain and acquire medicare  medicaid and schip enrollees is impacted by bids and plan designs submitted by us and our competitors 
under the medicaid managed care program  state medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs 
if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed 
table of contents care contracts  we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans 
under the medicare part d program  to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members  our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a threshold  which is set by the government after our bids are submitted 
if the enrollee premium is not below the government threshold  we risk losing the members who were auto assigned to us and we will not have additional members auto assigned to us 
for example  we lost approximately  of our auto enrolled low income subsidy members in because our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government 
in general  our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment  utilization  medical costs  and other factors 
in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect or our competitors bids and positioning are different than anticipated  either as a result of unforeseen changes to the medicare program or otherwise  our financial results could be materially affected 
if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians  hospitals  and other health care providers  our business could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals  pharmaceutical benefit service providers  pharmaceutical manufacturers  and other health care providers for competitive prices and services 
our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices and services 
failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers  whether in network or out of network  could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in any particular market  physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract  demand higher payments  or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain health care providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part 
in addition  physician or practice management companies  which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage  may compete directly with us 
if these providers refuse to contract with us  use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 
in addition  we have capitation arrangements with some physicians  hospitals and other health care providers 
under the typical arrangement  the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member 
under some capitated arrangements  the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements 
capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs  but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the professional 
to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement  we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement 
further  payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members 
there can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers 
any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 
in addition  some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us 
in those cases  we do not have a pre established understanding with the provider about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members 
in some states  the amount of compensation due to these out of network providers is defined by law or regulation  but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms 
in some instances  providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us 
for example  
table of contents we are involved in litigation with out of network providers that is described in more detail in legal matters in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with these out of network health care providers could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract  retain and provide support to a network of independent third party brokers  consultants and agents 
our products are sold in part through independent brokers  consultants and agents who assist in the production and servicing of business 
we typically do not have long term contracts with our independent brokers  consultants and agents  who generally are not exclusive to us and who frequently also recommend and or market health care products and services of our competitors 
as a result  we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance 
our sales would be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain independent brokers  consultants and agents or if we do not adequately provide support  training and education to them regarding our product portfolio  which is complex  or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels 
in addition  there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care products and the payments they receive 
these have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and selling these companies products 
for example  cms and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agents who market medicare products 
these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans and or changes to industry practice which could adversely impact our ability to market our products 
if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 
the collection  maintenance  use  disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our businesses are regulated at the international  federal and state levels 
these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation 
various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal glba and in hipaa 
hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as such term is defined in the hipaa regulations 
see item  business government regulation for a discussion of various federal and state privacy laws and regulations governing our businesses 
even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates  we still have limited control over their actions and practices 
privacy and security requirements regarding personally identifiable information are also imposed on us through controls with our customers 
in addition  despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules  our facilities and systems  and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches  acts of vandalism or theft  computer viruses  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors or other similar events 
congress and many states are considering new privacy and security requirements that would apply to our business 
compliance with new privacy and security laws  requirements  and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes  new limitations or constraints on our business models  the development of new administrative processes  and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates 
they also may impose further restrictions on our collection  disclosure and use of patient identifiable data that are housed in one or more of our administrative databases 
noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation  loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information  whether by us or by one of our vendors  could have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation and results of operations  including material fines and penalties  compensatory  special  punitive  and statutory damages  consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices  adverse actions against our licenses to do business  and injunctive relief 

table of contents our relationship with aarp is important and the loss of such relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
under our agreements with aarp  we provide aarp branded medicare supplement insurance  hospital indemnity insurance and other products to aarp members and medicare part d prescription drug plans to aarp members and non members 
one of our agreements with aarp expands the relationship to include aarp branded medicare advantage plans for aarp members and non members 
our agreements with aarp contain commitments regarding corporate governance  corporate social responsibility  diversity and measures intended to improve and simplify the health care experience for consumers 
the aarp agreements may be terminated early under certain circumstances  including  depending on the agreement  a material breach by either party  insolvency of either party  a material adverse change in the financial condition of the company  material changes in the medicare programs  material harm to aarp caused by the company  and by mutual agreement 
the success of our aarp arrangements depends  in part  on our ability to service aarp and its members  develop additional products and services  price the products and services competitively  meet our corporate governance  corporate social responsibility  and diversity commitments  and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes 
the loss of our aarp relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
because of the nature of our business  we are routinely subject to various litigation actions  which  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial penalties and or monetary damages and adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
periodically  we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business  such as employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  shareholder suits  and intellectual property related litigation 
in addition  because of the nature of our business  we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings 
these matters include  among others  claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment including disputes with enrollees  customers  and contracted and non contracted physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals  medical malpractice actions  contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices 
we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups 
we are largely self insured with regard to litigation risks 
although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self insurance  certain types of damages  such as punitive damages in some circumstances  are not covered by insurance 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self insured matters  however  it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded 
a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty  and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters 
therefore  these legal actions could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
matters relating to or arising out of our historical stock option practices  including regulatory inquiries  litigation matters  and potential additional cash and noncash charges could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in early  our board of directors initiated an independent review of the company s historical stock option practices from to the independent review was conducted by an independent committee comprised of three independent directors of the company independent committee with the assistance of independent counsel and independent accounting advisors 
on october   we announced that the independent committee had 
table of contents completed their review of the company s historical stock option practices and reported the findings to the non management directors of the company 
as a result of our historical stock option practices  we restated our previously filed financial statements  we incurred certain cash and non cash charges  we are subject to various regulatory inquiries and litigation matters  and we may be subject to further regulatory inquiries  litigation matters  and cash and noncash charges  the outcome of any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these regulatory inquiries and litigation matters 
our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially adversely affect our financial results 
fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could impair our profitability and capital position 
volatility in interest rates affects our interest income  and the market value of  our investments in fixed income debt securities of varying maturities  which comprise the majority of the fair value of our investments at december  in addition  defaults by issuers  primarily from investments in liquid corporate and municipal bonds  who fail to pay or perform on their obligations  could reduce our investment income and net realized investment gains or result in net realized investment losses as we may be required to write down the value of our investments  which would adversely affect our profitability and shareholders equity 
we also invest a small proportion of our investments in equity investments  which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments 
general economic conditions  stock market conditions  and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses 
there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of these investments 
changes in the value of our investment assets  as a result of interest rate fluctuations  illiquidity or otherwise  could have a negative effect on our shareholders equity 
in addition  if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired  our results of operations  shareholders equity and debt ratings could be materially adversely affected 
due largely to our past acquisitions  goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately billion as of december   representing approximately of our total assets 
if we make additional acquisitions  it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable  in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary 
any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
a material decrease in shareholders equity could  in turn  negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 
large scale medical emergencies may result in significant health care costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
large scale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death 
such emergencies could materially and adversely affect the us economy in general and the health care industry specifically 
for example  in the event of a natural disaster  bioterrorism attack  pandemic or other extreme events  we could face  among other things  significant health care costs and increased use of health care services 
any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if we fail to properly maintain the integrity or availability of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our ability to adequately price our products and services  to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion  and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems 
as a result of technology initiatives  changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions  we have been taking steps to consolidate and integrate the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities 
our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain  protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving systems and regulatory standards  and changing customer patterns 
if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively  we could lose existing customers  have difficulty attracting new customers  have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing  have disputes with customers  physicians and other health care professionals  have regulatory problems  have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences 
there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate  upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities  protecting and enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future 
failure to consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management s time and energy  which could materially impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products  our ability to market our knowledge and information related businesses could be hindered and our business could be adversely affected 
we rely on our agreements with customers  confidentiality agreements with employees  and our trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights 
these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in addition  substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry  and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows 
such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations  our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 
because we operate as a holding company  we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations 
these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states departments of insurance 
we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries 
the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated 
a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us 
in most states  we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts 
in addition  we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval 
an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies could impact the scale to which we could reinvest in our business through capital expenditures  business acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock and our ability to repay our debt 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations  our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 

table of contents any failure by us to manage and complete acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results  business and prospects 
as part of our business strategy  we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments  acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures  and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions 
if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives  we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally  we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
downgrades in our debt ratings  should they occur  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
claims paying ability  financial strength  and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are increasingly important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers 
our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings 
each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future 
our ratings reflect each rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders 
downgrades in our ratings  should they occur  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations

business overview unitedhealth group is a diversified health and well being company  serving more than million americans 
our focus is on enhancing the performance of the health system and improving the overall health and well being of the people we serve and their communities 
we work with health care professionals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care 
we help people get the care they need at an affordable cost  support the physician patient relationship  and empower people with the information  guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions 
through our diversified family of businesses  we leverage core competencies in advanced technology based transactional capabilities  health care data  knowledge and information  and health care resource organization and care facilitation to make health care work better 
we provide individuals with access to quality  cost effective health care services and resources 
we provide employers and consumers with excellent value  service and support  and we deliver value to our shareholders by executing a business strategy founded upon a commitment to balanced growth  profitability and capital discipline 
business trends our businesses participate in the us health economy  which comprises approximately of gross domestic product and which has grown consistently for many years 
management expects overall spending on health care in the us to continue to rise in the future  based on inflation  demographic trends in the us population and national interest in health and well being 
the rate of growth may be impacted by a variety of factors  including macro economic conditions and proposed health care reforms  which could also impact our results of operations 
adverse economic conditions the current us recessionary economic environment has impacted demand for certain of our products and services 
for example  decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our employer customers and will pressure top line growth for our unitedhealthcare business 
in contrast  our americhoice business has seen increased participation in its state medicaid offerings as employment rates fall 
if the recessionary economic environment continues for a prolonged period  federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate and or impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments 
in total  management believes that economic recessions will slow our revenue growth rate and could impact our operating profitability 
management also believes that government funding pressure  coupled with recessionary economic conditions  will impact the financial positions of hospitals  physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses 
for additional discussions regarding how a prolonged economic downturn could affect our business  see item a  risk factors 
proposed federal economic stimulus package in the short term  our businesses may benefit if proposed elements of the federal economic stimulus package responding to the current recession are signed into law 
these include expansion of funding to state programs  
table of contents which could mitigate funding pressure for americhoice medicaid offerings at the state level  expansion of coverage for recently unemployed workers through their former employers plans  which could enhance participation in unitedhealthcare benefit programs  and funding for health care information technology  which could expand market opportunities for ingenix 
proposed health care reforms there is regular dialogue about health care reforms at both state and national levels  due to the size of and national interest in the health economy 
examples of these health care reform proposals include policy changes that would change the dynamics of the health care industry  such as having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care system or a fundamental restructuring of the medicare or medicaid programs 
the new administration and various congressional leaders have signaled their interest in reducing payments to private plans offering medicare advantage 
depending on the extent and phasing of these potential reductions  management believes that the number of seniors participating in medicare advantage and the industry wide earnings derived from these plans may fall 
however  if payment rates do come down  management believes that there are a number of adjustments we can make to our operations annually  which may partially offset any earnings impact 
for example  we can adjust members benefits  we can decide on a county by county basis which geographies to participate in  and we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management 
any payment reductions may be phased in over a number of years 
if industry wide medicare advantage membership reduces  there is likely to be increased demand for medicare supplemental insurance and part d prescription drug coverage  and in both categories ovations is also a market leader 
we operate a diversified set of health care focused businesses  this business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors 
therefore  we could see simultaneous increases and decreases in demand for various of our products and services  depending on the scope  shape and timing of health care reforms 
it is difficult to predict the outcome of reform discussions with precision over the mid to long term time horizon 
for additional discussions regarding our risks related to health care reforms  see item a  risk factors

results compared to results consolidated financial results revenues revenues consist of premium revenues from risk based products  service revenues  which primarily include fees for management  administrative and consulting services  product revenues  and investment and other income 
premium revenues are primarily derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed  typically for a one year period  and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care benefits and related administrative costs 
service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self insure the medical costs of their employees and their dependants 
for both premium risk based and fee based customer arrangements  we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services  transaction processing  health care professional services  and access to contracted networks of physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals 
through our prescription solutions pbm business  revenues are derived from both products sold and administrative services 
product revenues also include sales of ingenix publishing and software products 
consolidated revenues for increased from primarily due to the increase in premium revenue in the health care services reporting segment 
the following is a discussion of consolidated revenues for each of our revenue components 
premium revenues 
the premium revenue growth generated by our health care services reporting segment was the primary driver in the consolidated premium revenues increase 
this increase was due to the growth in individuals served by our public and senior markets group  premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and acquisitions completed in  partially offset by a decline in individuals served through both unitedhealthcare risk based products and medicare part d prescription drug plans 
service revenues 
the increase in service revenues for was driven by an increased number of individuals served by fee based product arrangements in the health care services reporting segment  primarily due to the fiserv health acquisition 
in addition  our ingenix reporting segment generated service revenue growth from its health intelligence and contract research businesses as well as from business acquisitions 
product revenues 
product revenues for increased due to increased prescription volume at our prescription solutions reporting segment  primarily related to the fiserv health acquisition 

table of contents investment and other income 
the decrease in investment and other income in was primarily due to lower investment yields primarily as a result of the decrease in interest rates on our cash equivalents  decreased average investment balances related to lower operating cash flows  decreased deposits held for certain government sponsored programs and increased other than temporary impairment charges related to the disruption in the financial markets 
medical costs medical costs for increased primarily due to medical cost inflation  acquisitions completed in and growth in ovations medicare advantage and medicare supplement products  partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through both unitedhealthcare risk based products and medicare part d prescription drug plans 
the medical care ratio  calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues  reflects the combination of pricing  benefit designs  consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts 
our consolidated medical care ratio increase was primarily driven by premium rates advancing more slowly than medical costs in for certain risk based products in the commercial  senior and behavioral care markets 
for each period  our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods 
changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods  resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period  are included in total medical costs reported for the current period 
medical costs for included approximately million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years 
medical costs for included approximately million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years 
operating costs the operating cost ratio  calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues  increased in primarily due to certain expenses as discussed below  acquisitions completed in  costs for anticipated revenue growth that did not fully materialize and a change in business mix towards service revenues from fee based businesses 
operating costs for include million for the proposed settlements of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related legal costs  net of expected insurance proceeds  and million for the settlement of class action litigation related to reimbursement for out of network medical services  partially offset by a million reduction in expenses for proceeds from the sale of certain assets and membership of our individual medicare advantage hmo plans in clark and nye counties  nevada relating to the sierra acquisition

table of contents cost of products sold cost of products sold increased due to increased prescription volume at our prescription solutions reporting segment  primarily related to the fiserv health acquisition 
depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology development and enhancements  as well as additional depreciation and amortization related to recent business acquisitions 
interest expense interest expense increased due to an increase in our debt outstanding  which was partially offset by lower market interest rates on our floating rate debt 
income taxes the decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to lower earnings resulting in an increased proportion of tax free investment income to total earnings 
reporting segments we have four reporting segments health care services  which includes unitedhealthcare  ovations and americhoice  optumhealth  ingenix  and prescription solutions 
transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to health care services customers by prescription solutions  certain product offerings sold to health care services customers by optumhealth  and medical benefits cost  quality and utilization data and predictive modeling sold to health care services by ingenix 
these transactions are recorded at management s estimate of fair value

ingenix the improvement in ingenix revenues was due to continued growth in its health intelligence and contract research businesses as well as from business acquisitions 
the decrease in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to excess staffing costs during for certain research projects which were cancelled  as well as lower demand for certain consulting services due to the current economic environment

consolidated premium revenues increased in primarily due to premium rate increases  partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served by our commercial risk based products 
premium revenues for unitedhealthcare in totaled billion  an increase of million  or  over this increase was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of to on unitedhealthcare s renewing commercial risk based products and due to premiums from businesses acquired since the beginning of this was partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk based products in primarily due to our internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to commercial fee based products

americhoice premium revenues increased by million  or  over primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by medicaid products as well as rate increases 
the remaining premium revenue increase resulted primarily from membership growth and rate increases at optumhealth  which contributed a premium revenue increase of over service revenues 
the increase in consolidated service revenues was driven primarily by a increase in ingenix service revenues due to new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses and from businesses acquired since the beginning of in addition  unitedhealthcare service revenues increased due to a increase in the number of individuals served under commercial fee based arrangements during  as well as annual rate increases

the unitedhealthcare medical care ratio increased to in from in this increase was mainly due to our internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk based pricing environment as well as a shift from favorable medical cost development for unitedhealthcare during to unfavorable medical cost development during  which was partially driven by costs from higher benefit utilization in december primarily relating to high deductible risk based products 
the health care services operating margin for was  an increase from in  which reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and disciplined operating cost management as well as the factors discussed above 
the increase in the number of individuals served with commercial fee based products as of december  was driven by new customer relationships and customers converting from risk based products to fee based products  partially offset by employment attrition at continuing customers 
the number of individuals served with commercial risk based products decreased primarily due to a competitive pricing environment and the conversion of individuals to fee based products 
the number of individuals served by medicare advantage products as of december  decreased primarily due to a decline in participation in private fee for service offerings  while individuals served by standardized medicare supplement products increased due to new customer relationships 
medicaid enrollment increased in primarily due to new customer gains  including  individuals served under the tenncare program in tennessee 
optumhealth the optumhealth revenues increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by several of its specialty benefit businesses and rate increases related to these businesses 
optumhealth earnings from operations increased in primarily due to the membership growth and rate increases

liquidity  financial condition and capital resources liquidity and financial condition we manage our cash  investments and capital structure to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility 
we forecast  analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations 
a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
after considering expected cash flows from operating activities  we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short term obligations in longer term  investment grade  marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return 
these investments are made pursuant to our board of directors approved investment policy  which generally governs return objectives  regulatory limitations  tax implications and risk tolerances  which focuses on preservation of capital  diversification and duration 
cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities is paid to their non regulated parent companies  typically in the form of dividends  for general corporate use  when and as permitted by applicable regulations 
our non regulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations for general corporate use 
cash flows generated by these entities  combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long term debt  as well as the availability of committed credit facilities  further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility 
we generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses by making capital expenditures  expanding our services through business acquisitions and repurchasing shares of our common stock  depending on market conditions 
cash flows generated from operating activities  our primary source of liquidity  are principally from net earnings  prior to depreciation and amortization and other non cash expenses 
as a result  any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
the level of profitability of our risk based business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases 
this risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses  the geographic and customer diversity of our risk based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes  which seek to match premium rate increases with future health care costs 

table of contents a summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below 
for the year ended december  in millions sources of cash cash provided by operating activities maturities and sales of investments proceeds from issuance of long term debt other total sources of cash uses of cash purchases of investments cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash assumed and dispositions common stock repurchases other total uses of cash net decrease increase in cash net cash flows from operating activities decreased billion in  or  primarily due to the decrease in net earnings of billion which included payments of million  net of taxes  for the settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices 
for detail on these settlements  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalent and available for sale investment balances of billion included billion of cash and cash equivalents  billion of debt securities and million of equity securities and venture capital funds 
given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents  we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity 
the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies  primarily used in valuing our level equity securities  may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments 
due to the subjective nature of these assumptions  the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if the investment was sold at the measurement date 
other sources of liquidity  primarily from operating cash flows  reduce the need to sell investments in adverse markets 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail of our fair value measurements 
our investment portfolio has a relatively short average duration and a weighted average credit rating of aa as of december  included in the debt securities balance is billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by third parties 
the securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors  and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor neither indirect through the guarantees  nor direct through investment in the guarantor 
further  due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers  the weighted average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is aa as of december  for the securities for which such information is available 
commercial paper 
commercial paper consisted of senior unsecured debt sold on a discount basis with maturities up to days 
as of december   we had million of outstanding commercial paper with interest rates ranging from to 
this range in rates reflects increases in the market rates for tier credit rated commercial paper 
share repurchases 
under our board of directors authorization  we maintain a common share repurchase program 
repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices 
during  we repurchased million shares at an average price of approximately per share and an aggregate cost of approximately billion 
as of december   we had board of directors authorization to purchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock 

table of contents capital resources as of december  and december   we had commercial paper and long term debt outstanding of billion and billion  respectively 
the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors  including our profitability  operating cash flows  debt levels  credit ratings  debt covenants and other contractual restrictions  regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions 
for example  a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital 
we have therefore adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital 
cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we maintained a highly liquid position  with cash  cash equivalents and investments of billion as of december  as further described under dividend restrictions  many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 
as of december   approximately million of our billion of cash and investments was held by non regulated subsidiaries and was available for general corporate use  including acquisitions and share repurchases

debt covenants 
our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants  the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debt to total capital ratio below 
our debt to total capital ratio calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper  debt and shareholders equity was and as of december  and december   respectively 
we were in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants as of december  in august  we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold our senior unsecured notes due march  alleging a violation of the indenture governing those debt securities 
this followed our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the proceeding regarding the purported default 
bank credit facilities 
in november  we entered into a million day revolving bank credit facility which replaced our billion day revolving bank credit facility entered into in november the interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on libor plus a spread 
at december   the interest rate ranged from to 
in may  we amended and restated our billion five year revolving bank credit facility which included increasing the capacity 
there is currently billion available under this credit facility which matures in may the interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on libor plus a spread 
at december   the interest rate ranged from to 

table of contents these credit facilities support our commercial paper program and are available for general working capital purposes 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under our credit facilities 
dividend restrictions 
we conduct a significant portion of our operations through subsidiaries that are subject to regulations and standards established by their respective states of domicile 
most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the national association of insurance commissioners 
these standards  among other things  require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 
generally  the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the entity s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 
an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies could impact the scale to which we could reinvest in our business through capital expenditures  business acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
in addition  an inability to pay regulated dividends could impact our ability to repay our debt  however  our cash flows from operations of our unregulated businesses  as well as liquidity at the parent level in the form of cash and cash equivalent balances and commercial paper or bank funding  mitigate this risk 
see item a  risk factors for a discussion of our risks related to dividend restrictions on our regulated subsidiaries 
in  based on the statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels  the maximum amount of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval was billion 
as of december   our regulated subsidiaries have paid their parent companies dividends of billion  including billion of extraordinary dividends approved by state insurance regulators

critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
medical costs each reporting period  we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes 
we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied  centrally controlled and automated 
the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt  claim backlogs  seasonal variances in medical care consumption  health care professional contract rate changes  medical care utilization and other medical cost trends  membership volume and demographics  benefit plan changes  and business mix changes related to products  customers and geography 
depending on the health care professional and type of service  the typical billing lag for services can be up to days from the date of service 
substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service 
we estimate liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
each period  we re examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as more complete claim information becomes available  we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate  we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate  we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development 
historically  the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than of annual medical costs  less than of annual earnings from operations and less than of medical costs payable 
in developing our medical costs payable estimates  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for example  we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent month period 
a completion factor is an actuarial estimate  based upon historical experience  of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation 
for months prior to the most recent three months  we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated to date in order to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months 
we do not believe that completion factors are a reliable basis for estimating claims incurred for the most recent three months as there is typically insufficient claim data available for those months to calculate credible completion factors 
accordingly  for the most recent three months  we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available  supplemented by a review of near term completion factors 
medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including  but not limited to  pharmacy utilization trends  inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease 
table of contents control  as well as through a review of near term completion factors 
this approach is consistently applied from period to period 
completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods  generally periods prior to the most recent three months 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december  completion factors increase decrease in factors increase decrease in medical costs in millions medical cost pmpm trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december  medical cost pmpm trend increase decrease in factors increase decrease in medical costs in millions the analyses above include those outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 
in order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period  one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period 
the accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations in millions favorable development increase decrease to medical costs a medical costs earnings from operations as reported as adjusted b as reported as adjusted b c  c  c a the amount of favorable development recorded in the current year pertaining to the prior year less the amount of favorable development recorded in the subsequent year pertaining to the current year 
b represents reported amounts adjusted to reflect the net impact of medical cost development 
c not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in will change as our december  medical costs payable estimate develops throughout 
table of contents our estimate of medical costs payable represents management s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of december   developed using consistently applied actuarial methods 
management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments may differ from established estimates 
assuming a hypothetical difference between our december  estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable  excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance  net earnings would increase or decrease by million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by per share 
the current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation 
these include setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs  coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals 
through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals  we emphasize preventive health care  appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards  education and closing gaps in care 
we believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful 
however  other factors including competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers  major epidemics  and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation 
because of the narrow operating margins of our risk based products  changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results 
revenues revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums 
we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services 
customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services  as recorded in our records 
employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears 
each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing 
we estimate and adjust the current period s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly 
our estimates are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information 
we revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known 
we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms 
cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors 
the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate are expected to have higher medical costs 
under this risk adjustment methodology  cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient  hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings 
necessary and available diagnosis data collected and captured by us and health care providers is submitted to cms within prescribed deadlines 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets as of december   we had long lived assets  including goodwill  other intangible assets and property  equipment and capitalized software  of billion 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level  and we review our remaining long lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value 
to determine the fair value of our long lived assets and assess their recoverability  we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows  which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues  expenses and operating margins 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the 
table of contents future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
there were no material impairments at december  investments as of december   we had approximately billion of investments  primarily held in marketable debt securities 
our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
we exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses  net of income tax effects  as a separate component in shareholders equity 
we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments 
as of december   our investments had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
if any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary  based on analysis of relevant factors  we record a realized loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment s fair value is other than temporary 
we analyze relevant factors individually and in combination including the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time in order to enable recovery of our cost 
new information and the passage of time can change these judgments 
we revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known or when we do not anticipate holding the investment until recovery and record any resulting impairment charges at that time 
we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector  and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities  asset backed  and corporate debt obligations  substantially all of investment grade quality 
if securities are downgraded below policy minimums  subsequent to purchase  they will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy 
contingent liabilities because of the nature of our businesses  we are routinely involved in various disputes  legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters 
our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel  if appropriate  and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage  if any  for such matters 
it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions 
see item a  risk factors for a description of the risks related to our pending regulatory inquiries and litigation 
legal matters a description of our legal proceedings is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference herein 
concentrations of credit risk investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk 
our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors 
this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base 
as of december   we had an aggregate billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our golden rule financial corporation life and annuity business in we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery 
currently  the reinsurer is rated by am best as a 
as of december   there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks are exposures to a changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed rate financial investments and debt and b changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments 
as of december   approximately billion of our financial investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates  which may materially impact our investment income 
also  approximately billion of our debt as of december  was at interest rates that vary with market rates  either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts  which may materially impact our interest expense 
the fair value of certain of our fixed rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates 
as of december   approximately billion of our investments were fixed rate debt securities  and approximately billion of our debt was fixed rate term debt with no related interest rate swap contracts 
an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed rate investments and fixed rate debt 
conversely  a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed rate investments and fixed rate debt 
we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices  as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time  either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts 
as part of our risk management strategy  we enter into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense 
the differential between the fixed rates received and the variable rates paid is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
our swap agreements converted a majority of our interest expense from a fixed to variable rates to better offset the impact of market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments
