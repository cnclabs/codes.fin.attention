item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with financial statement and supplementary data in item of this annual report 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this annual report 
see forward looking statements below 
overview we are one of the world s largest offshore drilling contractors operating  as of february   a fleet of rigs  consisting of two ultra deepwater drillships  semisubmersible rigs  jackups and three managed deepwater drilling rigs 
we also have four ultra deepwater drillships under construction 
our customers include major integrated oil and natural gas companies  state owned national oil companies and independent oil and natural gas companies 
our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of drilling services to smaller companies focused on more specific geographic or technological areas 
we are continuing to increase our emphasis on deepwater drilling 
although crude oil demand and prices have declined recently  we believe the long term prospects for deepwater drilling are positive given that the expected growth in oil consumption from developing nations  limited growth in crude oil supplies and high depletion rates of mature oil fields  together with geologic successes  improving access to promising offshore areas and new  more efficient technologies  will continue to be catalysts for the exploration and development of deepwater fields 
since  we have invested or committed to invest over billion in the expansion of our deepwater fleet  including four new ultra deepwater drillships under construction 
three of the drillships have multiyear contracts at favorable rates  with two scheduled to work in the strategically important deepwater us gulf of mexico  which in addition to our operations in brazil and west africa  provides us with exposure to all three of the world s most active deepwater basins 
since  we also have disposed of non core assets  generating billion in proceeds  to enable us to reinvest our financial and human capital to deepwater drilling 
our transition to a pure offshore focused company is essentially complete 
we expect that our customers will lower exploration and development spending in due to the current economic downturn 
however  we anticipate that deepwater activity will outperform other drilling sectors due to the long term field development activities of our customers and more favorable drilling economics 
our contract backlog at december  totals billion and is comprised primarily of contracts with large integrated oil and national oil companies with long term development plans 
with our low debt levels relative to our total capitalization  we believe that we have sufficient financial resources to sustain our focus through this economic downturn 
recent developments investments in deepwater fleet in june  we entered into an agreement with samsung heavy industries co  ltd 
to construct an advanced capability ultra deepwater drillship 
the agreement provides for an aggregate fixed purchase price of approximately million 
the agreement provides that  following shipyard construction  commissioning and testing  the drillship is to be delivered to us on or before june  we have the right to rescind the contract for delays exceeding certain periods and the right to liquidated damages from samsung for delays during certain periods 
we have entered into a five year contract with respect to the drillship  which is expected to commence during the fourth quarter of following the completion of shipyard construction  mobilization of the rig to an initial operating location and customer acceptance testing 
in connection with the contract  the drillship is being modified from the original design to provide enhanced capabilities designed to allow our clients to conduct subsea construction activities and other simultaneous activities  while drilling or completing the well 
including these modifications  amounts already paid  commissioning and testing  we expect the total project cost to be approximately million  excluding capitalized interest 
in addition  while we have previously purchased a license to equip the rig for dual activity use  the rig will not initially be functional as a dual activity rig  but can be modified to add this functionality in the future 
in july  we acquired from lexton shipping ltd 
an advanced capability ultra deepwater drillship being constructed by samsung 
as consideration for our acquisition of lexton s rights under the drillship construction contract with samsung  we paid lexton million in cash and assumed its obligations under the construction contract  including remaining scheduled payments of approximately million 
the construction contract provides that  following shipyard construction  commissioning and testing  the drillship is to be delivered to us on or before february  we have the right to rescind the contract for delays exceeding certain periods and the right to liquidated damages from samsung for delays during certain periods 
we have entered into a five year contract with respect to the drillship  which is expected to commence during the third quarter of following the completion of shipyard construction  mobilization of the rig to the us gulf of mexico and customer acceptance testing 
in connection with the contract  the drillship is being modified from the original design to provide enhanced capabilities designed to allow our clients to conduct subsea construction activities and other simultaneous activities  while drilling or completing the well 
including these modifications  amounts already paid  commissioning and testing  we expect the total project cost to be approximately million  excluding capitalized interest 
in august  we acquired the remaining nine percent interest in our angolan joint venture company for million in cash from a subsidiary of sonangol  the national oil company of angola 
the joint venture owned the two ultra deepwater drillships pride africa and pride angola and the foot independent leg jackup rig pride cabinda  and held management agreements for the deepwater platform rigs kizomba a and kizomba b 
in january  we entered into an agreement with samsung to construct an advanced capability ultra deepwater drillship 
the agreement provides for an aggregate fixed purchase price of approximately million 
the agreement provides that  following shipyard construction  commissioning and testing  the drillship is to be delivered to us on or before march  we have the right to rescind the contract for delays exceeding certain periods and the right to liquidated damages from samsung for delays during certain periods 
we have entered into a multi year drilling contract with respect to the drillship  which is expected to commence during the second quarter of following the completion of shipyard construction  mobilization of the rig and customer acceptance testing 
under the drilling contract  the customer may elect  by january   a firm contract term of at least five years and up to seven years in duration 
we expect the total project cost  including commissioning and testing  to be approximately million  excluding capitalized interest 
in august  we entered into an agreement for the construction of a fourth ultra deepwater drillship 
the agreement provides for an aggregate fixed purchase price of approximately million 
the agreement provides that  following shipyard construction  commissioning and testing  the drillship is to be delivered to us on or before the fourth quarter of we have the right to rescind the contract for delays exceeding certain periods and the right to liquidated damages for delays during certain periods 
we expect the total project cost  including commissioning and testing  to be approximately million  excluding capitalized interest 
although we currently do not have a drilling contract for this drillship  we expect that the anticipated long term demand for deepwater drilling capacity should provide us with a number of opportunities to contract the rig prior to its delivery date 
separation of our mat supported jackup business we have filed a form registration statement with the securities and exchange commission with respect to the distribution to our stockholders of all of the shares of common stock of a subsidiary that would hold  directly or indirectly  the assets and liabilities of our rig mat supported jackup business 
we believe that the spin off has the potential to facilitate our growth strategies and reduce our cost of capital  and to allow us to refine our focus and further enhance our reputation as a provider of deepwater drilling services 
the spin off  which we expect to complete in  is contingent upon approval of the final plan by our board of directors  a favorable ruling from the internal revenue service  the effectiveness of the form registration statement  compliance with covenants under our existing debt agreements and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that we will complete the spin off within that time period or at all 
following the spin off  we will be focused on deepwater opportunities with a concentration of high specification deepwater rigs  and the subsidiary will be focused on shallow water drilling in the gulf of mexico 
dispositions in february  we completed the sale of our fleet of three self erecting  tender assist rigs for million in cash 
in connection with the sale  we are operating one of the rigs until its current contract is completed  which is anticipated to be in first quarter of in may  we sold our entire fleet of platform rigs and related land  buildings and equipment for million in cash 
in connection with the sale  we entered into lease agreements with the buyer to operate two platform rigs until their current contracts are completed  which is expected to occur in the second quarter of the leases require us to pay to the buyer all revenues from the operation of the rigs  less operating costs and a small per day management fee  which we retain 
in july  we entered into agreements to sell our eastern hemisphere land rig business  which constituted our only remaining land drilling operations  for million in cash 
the sale of all but one of the rigs closed in the fourth quarter of we are leasing the remaining rig to the buyer until the sale of that rig is completed  which is expected to occur in the first half of we have reclassified the historical results of operations of our former latin america land and e p services segments  which we sold for billion in  our three tender assist rigs and our eastern hemisphere land rig operations to discontinued operations 
unless noted otherwise  the discussion and analysis that follows relates to our continuing operations only 
loss of pride wyoming in september  the pride wyoming  a foot slot type jackup rig operating in the us gulf of mexico  was deemed a total loss for insurance purposes after it was severely damaged and sank as a result of hurricane ike 
the rig had a net book value of approximately million and was insured for million 
we have collected a total of million through october for the insured value of the rig  which is net of our loss retention of million 
we expect to incur costs of approximately million for removal of the wreckage and salvage operations  not including any costs arising from damage to offshore structures owned by third parties 
these costs for removal of the wreckage and salvage operations in excess of a million retention are expected to be covered by our insurance 
we will be responsible for payment of the million retention  million in premium payments for a removal of wreckage claim and for any costs not covered by our insurance 
the owners of two pipelines on which parts of the pride wyoming settled have requested that we pay for all costs  expenses and other losses associated with the damage  including loss of revenue 
each owner has claimed damages in excess of million 
other pieces of the rig may have also caused damage to certain other offshore structures 
in october  we filed a complaint in the us federal district court pursuant to the limitation of liability act  which has the potential to statutorily limit our exposure for claims arising out of third party damages caused by the loss of the pride wyoming 
based on information available to us at this time  we do not expect the outcome of this potential claim to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows  however  there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of this potential claim 
although we believe we have adequate insurance  we will be responsible for any awards not covered by our insurance 
redemption of convertible notes in april  we called for redemption all of the outstanding convertible senior notes due the notes entitled the holders to elect to convert the notes into our common stock at a rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes or approximately million shares in the aggregate prior to the redemption date 
in accordance with the indenture governing the notes  we elected to retire our obligation on the notes tendered for conversion using a combination of cash and common stock 
in connection with the retirement of the notes  we delivered to holders an aggregate of approximately million in cash and approximately million shares of common stock 
with our common stock trading above the conversion price of during the redemption period  our potential obligation to issue common stock upon conversion of the notes resulted in the inclusion of the full million shares in our fully diluted share count 
however  our delivery of approximately million in connection with the retirement of the principal amount of the notes reduced the number of shares delivered and essentially had the same effect as a share repurchase 
drillship loan repayment in march  we repaid the outstanding aggregate principal amount of million due under the drillship loan facility collaterized by the pride africa and pride angola 
in connection with the retirement of the drillship loan facility  we recognized a charge of million related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
we also settled all of the related interest rate swap and cap agreements 
fcpa investigation during the course of an internal audit and investigation relating to certain of our latin american operations  our management and internal audit department received allegations of improper payments to foreign government officials 
in february  the audit committee of our board of directors assumed direct responsibility over the investigation and retained independent outside counsel to investigate the allegations  as well as corresponding accounting entries and internal control issues  and to advise the audit committee 
the investigation  which is continuing  has found evidence suggesting that payments  which may violate the us foreign corrupt practices act  were made to government officials in venezuela and mexico aggregating less than million 
the evidence to date regarding these payments suggests that payments were made beginning in early through a to vendors with the intent that they would be transferred to government officials for the purpose of extending drilling contracts for two jackup rigs and one semisubmersible rig operating offshore venezuela  and b to one or more government officials  or to vendors with the intent that they would be transferred to government officials  for the purpose of collecting payment for work completed in connection with offshore drilling contracts in venezuela 
in addition  the evidence suggests that other payments were made beginning in through early a to one or more government officials in mexico in connection with the clearing of a jackup rig and equipment through customs  the movement of personnel through immigration or the acceptance of a jackup rig under a drilling contract  and b with respect to the potentially improper entertainment of government officials in mexico 
the audit committee  through independent outside counsel  has undertaken a review of our compliance with the fcpa in certain of our other international operations 
in addition  the us department of justice has asked us to provide information with respect to a our relationships with a freight and customs agent and b our importation of rigs into nigeria 
the audit committee is reviewing the issues raised by the request  and we are cooperating with the doj in connection with its request 
this review has found evidence suggesting that during the period from through payments were made directly or indirectly to government officials in saudi arabia  kazakhstan  brazil  nigeria  libya  angola  and the republic of the congo in connection with clearing rigs or equipment through customs or resolving outstanding issues with customs  immigration  tax  licensing or merchant marine authorities in those countries 
in addition  this review has found evidence suggesting that in payments were made to one or more third parties with the intent that they would be transferred to a government official in india for the purpose of resolving a customs dispute related to the importation of one of our jackup rigs 
the evidence suggests that the aggregate amount of payments referred to in this paragraph is less than million 
we are also reviewing certain agent payments related to malaysia 
the investigation of the matters described in the prior paragraph and the audit committee s compliance review are ongoing 
accordingly  there can be no assurances that evidence of additional potential fcpa violations may not be uncovered in those or other countries 
our management and the audit committee of our board of directors believe it likely that then members of our senior operations management either were aware  or should have been aware  that improper payments to foreign government officials were made or proposed to be made 
our former chief operating officer resigned as chief operating officer effective on may  and has elected to retire from the company  although he will remain an employee  but not an officer  during the pendency of the investigation to assist us with the investigation and to be available for consultation and to answer questions relating to our business 
his retirement benefits will be subject to the determination by our audit committee or our board of directors that it does not have cause as defined in his retirement agreement with us to terminate his employment 
other personnel  including officers  have been terminated or placed on administrative leave or have resigned in connection with the investigation 
we have taken and will continue to take disciplinary actions where appropriate and various other corrective action to reinforce our commitment to conducting our business ethically and legally and to instill in our employees our expectation that they uphold the highest levels of honesty  integrity  ethical standards and compliance with the law 
we voluntarily disclosed information relating to the initial allegations and other information found in the investigation and compliance review to the doj and the securities and exchange commission and are cooperating with these authorities as the investigation and compliance reviews continue and as they review the matter 
if violations of the fcpa occurred  we could be subject to fines  civil and criminal penalties  equitable remedies  including profit disgorgement  and injunctive relief 
civil penalties under the antibribery provisions of the fcpa could range up to  per violation  with a criminal fine up to the greater of million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain to us or twice the gross pecuniary loss to others  if larger 
civil penalties under the accounting provisions of the fcpa can range up to  and a company that knowingly commits a violation can be fined up to million 
in addition  both the sec and the doj could assert that conduct extending over a period of time may constitute multiple violations for purposes of assessing the penalty amounts 
often  dispositions for these types of matters result in modifications to business practices and compliance programs and possibly a monitor being appointed to review future business and practices with the goal of ensuring compliance with the fcpa 
we could also face fines  sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions  including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of rigs or other assets 
our customers in those jurisdictions could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests 
we could also face other third party claims by directors  officers  employees  affiliates  advisors  attorneys  agents  stockholders  debt holders  or other interest holders or constituents of our company 
in addition  disclosure of the subject matter of the investigation could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current clients and potential clients  to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets 
no amounts have been accrued related to any potential fines  sanctions  claims or other penalties  which could be material individually or in the aggregate 
we cannot currently predict what  if any  actions may be taken by the doj  the sec  any other applicable government or other authorities or our customers or other third parties or the effect the actions may have on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows  on our consolidated financial statements or on our business in the countries at issue and other jurisdictions 
our business we provide contract drilling services to major integrated  government owned and independent oil and natural gas companies throughout the world 
our drilling fleet competes on a global basis  as offshore rigs generally are highly mobile and may be moved from one region to another in response to demand 
while the cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to vary somewhat between regions  significant variations between regions do not tend to persist long term because of rig mobility 
key factors in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a contract include pricing  safety record and competency 
rig availability  location and technical ability can also be key factors in the determination 
currently  all of our drilling contracts with our customers are on a dayrate basis  where we charge the customer a fixed amount per day regardless of the number of days needed to drill the well 
we provide the rigs and drilling crews and are responsible for the payment of rig operating and maintenance expenses 
our customer bears the economic risk and benefit relative to the geologic success of the wells 
the markets for our drilling services are highly cyclical 
our operating results are significantly affected by the level of energy industry spending for the exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and natural gas companies exploration and development drilling programs drive the demand for drilling services 
these drilling programs are affected by oil and natural gas companies expectations regarding crude oil and natural gas prices  anticipated production levels  worldwide demand for crude oil and natural gas products and many other factors 
the availability of quality drilling prospects  exploration success  availability of qualified rigs and operating personnel  relative production costs  availability and lead time requirements for drilling and production equipment  the stage of reservoir development and political and regulatory environments also affect our customers drilling programs 
crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile  which has historically led to significant fluctuations in expenditures by our customers for oil and natural gas drilling services 
variations in market conditions during the cycle impact us in different ways depending primarily on the length of drilling contracts in different regions 
for example  contracts in the shallow water us gulf of mexico are shorter term  so a deterioration or improvement in market conditions tends to quickly impact revenues and cash flows from those operations 
contracts in deepwater and other international offshore markets tend to be longer term  so a change in market conditions tends to have a delayed impact 
accordingly  short term changes in market conditions may have minimal short term impact on revenues and cash flows from those operations unless the timing of contract renewals takes place during the short term changes in the market 
our revenues depend principally upon the number of our available rigs  the number of days these rigs are utilized and the contract dayrates received 
the number of days our rigs are utilized and the contract dayrates received are largely dependent upon the balance of supply of drilling rigs and demand for drilling services for the different rig classes we operate  as well as our rigs operational performance  including mechanical efficiency 
the number of rigs we have available may increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs  the construction of new rigs  the number of rigs being upgraded or repaired or undergoing periodic surveys or routine maintenance at any time and the number of rigs idled during periods of oversupply in the market or when we are unable to contract our rigs at economical rates 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher contract day rates  we may mobilize our rigs from one geographic region to another for which we may receive a mobilization fee 
mobilization fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the contract 
our earnings from operations are primarily affected by revenues  cost of labor  repairs and maintenance and utilization of our drilling fleet 
many of our drilling contracts allow us to adjust the dayrates charged to our customer based on changes in operating costs  such as increases in labor costs  maintenance and repair costs  and insurance costs 
some of our costs are fixed in nature or do not vary at the same time or to the same degree as changes in revenue 
for instance  if a rig is expected to be idle between contracts and earn no revenue  we may maintain our rig crew  which reduces our earnings as we cannot fully offset the impact of the lost revenues with reductions in operating costs 
our industry has been affected by shortages of  and competition for  skilled rig crew personnel due to the level of activity in the drilling industry  the aging workforce and the training and skill set of applicants 
as a result  the costs to attract and retain certain skilled personnel may continue to increase 
to better retain and attract skilled rig personnel  we offer competitive compensation programs and have increased our focus on training and management development programs 
we believe that labor costs may continue to increase in for skilled personnel and in certain geographic locations 
in addition  increased demand for contract drilling operations has increased demand for oilfield equipment and spare parts  which  when coupled with the consolidation of equipment suppliers  has resulted in longer order lead times to obtain critical spares and other critical equipment components essential to our business  higher repair and maintenance costs and longer out of service time for major repair and upgrade projects 
we anticipate maintaining higher levels of critical spares to minimize unplanned downtime 
with the decline in prices for steel and other key inputs and the decline in level of business activity  we believe that some softening of lead times and pricing for spare parts and equipment is likely to occur 
the amount and timing of moderation of costs will be affected by our suppliers level of backlog and the number of remaining newbuilds 
our operations and activities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations  including the us oil pollution act of  the us outer continental shelf lands act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act and the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships 
additionally  other countries where we operate have similar laws and regulations covering the discharge of oil and other contaminants in connection with drilling operations 
the decline in crude oil prices that began in late  following the onset of the global financial crisis  deteriorating global economic fundamentals and the resulting decline in crude oil demand in a number of the world s largest oil consuming nations  is expected to have a negative impact on offshore activity 
lower average crude oil prices resulting from declining global demand have resulted in some of our customers reducing planned expenditures for drilling activity  with this decline expected to be more pronounced in exploration activities  which are characterized by shorter term projects 
however  deepwater drilling activity is expected to display more resilience relative to other offshore drilling activities  especially for projects currently in development 
typically  utilization for the industry s deepwater fleet has remained high even during market downturns due to the advanced technical features of the rigs and the limited supply of rigs capable of addressing the increasingly complex drilling projects of our clients 
however  some clients could engage in subletting of rigs to other parties in an effort to reduce their capital commitments  which could drive lower the dayrates paid for deepwater rigs in we believe that long term market conditions for offshore drilling services are generally favorable and that demand for offshore rigs could continue to exceed supply for the next several years  producing attractive opportunities for offshore drilling rigs  including deepwater rigs such as ours under construction 
we expect the long term global demand for deepwater offshore contract drilling services to remain strong  driven by increasing worldwide demand for crude oil and natural gas when economic recovery begins  an increased focus by oil and natural gas companies on offshore prospects and increased global participation by national oil companies 
customer requirements for deepwater drilling capacity is steady  as successful results in exploration drilling have led to prolonged field development programs around the world  placing deepwater assets in limited supply beyond the end of the decade 
we believe that long term economic factors and demand for crude oil will lead to higher prices for crude oil in the future 
with geological successes in exploratory markets  such as the tupi field offshore brazil  and  in general  more favorable conditions allowing international oil companies access to new field development  we believe exploration and production companies will continue to pursue the development of new deepwater projects and discoveries 
in addition  we believe that the need for deepwater rigs will continue to grow for existing offshore development projects 
we organize our reportable segments based on the general asset class of our drilling rigs 
our reportable segments include deepwater  which consists of our rigs capable of drilling in water depths greater than  feet  and midwater  which consists of our semisubmersible rigs capable of drilling in water depths of  feet or less 
our jackup fleet  which operates in water depths up to feet  is reported as two segments  independent leg jackups and mat supported jackups 
we also manage the drilling operations for three deepwater rigs  which are included in a non reported operating segment along with corporate costs and other operations 
our deepwater fleet currently operates in west africa  brazil and the mediterranean sea and we expect to expand into the strategically important us gulf of mexico region in following the delivery of two of our four deepwater drillships currently under construction 
including rig days for our drillships under construction  based upon their scheduled delivery dates  we have of our available rig days for our deepwater fleet contracted in  in  in and in customer demand for deepwater drilling rigs has increased steadily since  with the industry s fleet of units experiencing full utilization through and deepwater rig shortages apparent since the high customer demand has led to a steep rise in deepwater rig dayrates  reaching  per day for some multi year contracts agreed to during late the deepwater drilling business has been supported by strong geologic success  especially in brazil and west africa  and the emergence of new  promising deepwater regions  such as india  libya and mexico  along with advances in seismic gathering and interpretation and well completion technologies 
these developments have contributed to record backlog levels and contracted rig utilization at or near through the end of  although we expect our revenues for the segment to be negatively impacted by approximately days of unplanned downtime for the pride north america in the first quarter of in addition  deepwater drilling economics have been aided in recent years by higher average crude oil prices  and an increased number of deepwater discoveries 
these improving factors associated with deepwater activity have produced a growing base of development programs requiring multiple years to complete and resulting in long term contract awards by our customers  especially for projects in brazil  west africa and the us gulf of mexico  and represents a significant portion of our revenue backlog that currently extends into our midwater fleet currently operates offshore africa and brazil  and we expect this geographic presence to remain unchanged through we currently have of our available rig days for our midwater fleet contracted in  in  in and in recently  demand for midwater rigs has been supported by increased customer needs in brazil and in emerging locations such as libya 
we expect there will be an increase in subletting of rig time in following the decline in crude oil prices  which could affect contract renewals due to the increased rig availability 
many of the industry s midwater rigs are utilized in mature offshore regions that are sensitive to crude oil price volatility  such as the north sea 
with the average remaining contract duration on a midwater rig at approximately two years  customers in some regions  such as the uk north sea  and others with limited capital resources  are increasingly subletting rig time in an effort to reduce capital spending during  contributing to a more challenging near to intermediate term pricing environment 
our independent leg jackup rig fleet currently operates in mexico  the middle east  asia pacific and west africa 
we currently have of our available rig days for our independent leg jackup fleet contracted in  in  in and none in since  jackup rigs have been added to the global fleet  with another expected to be added in to the global financial crisis  which has created a difficult environment to obtain needed funding for fleet expansion  could result in some of the expected rig deliveries to be delayed significantly or cancelled 
customer demand is not expected to match or exceed the supply of international jackup rigs in therefore  utilization and dayrates are expected to decline from levels 
contract durations have begun to shorten throughout the existing fleet of jackup rigs  and the majority of rigs being delivered in and beyond are without contracts 
dayrates for standard international class jackup rigs peaked during and are expected to continue to decline as utilization in declines 
we continue to expect jackup needs in mexico to increase during  as pemex attempts to reverse substantial crude oil production declines 
recently  pemex has indicated a shifting focus toward geologic prospects in deeper water and  therefore  an increased emphasis on rigs with a water depth rating of feet or greater  especially independent leg cantilever rigs 
our mat supported jackup fleet operates in the united states and mexico 
the shallow water us gulf of mexico is one of the most mature offshore basins in the world 
we currently have of our available rig days  which includes rigs that are currently stacked  for our mat supported jackup fleet contracted in  and none in  and drilling activity in the region is typically conducted by small independent exploration and production companies with the level of activity heavily influenced by the price of natural gas 
production prospects are typically small with high depletion rates and jackup rigs are employed by clients for short term  well to well programs 
throughout most of  utilization and dayrates for the us gulf of mexico based jackup rigs improved steadily due in part to higher natural gas prices and a reduction in the supply of jackup rigs following the continued relocation of rigs to international markets and the industry s loss of four units during hurricane ike 
also  with the historically high crude oil price experienced into mid  a number of clients employed jackup rigs to drill small accumulations of crude oil  constraining further the supply of rigs in the region 
recently  the aggregate fleet utilization for us jackup rigs has declined to approximately  as natural gas prices fell following the onset of the global financial crisis and deteriorating economic conditions in the united states 
the inability of some clients to access credit markets to fund their exploration and production programs also contributed to the decline in activity 
jackup rig activity is expected to decline further in due to the expected continuation of the unfavorable commodity price trend and the inability for some of our customers to gain access to capital to fund exploration and production spending 
typically  when fleet utilization declines below  rig dayrates begin to fall 
some jackup rig capacity is expected to be removed from active service due to the weaker business environment  which is expected to keep rig dayrates above the cash cost to operate the rigs 
as pemex changes its focus toward new field exploration and development prospects that increasingly require the use of rigs with greater water depth capability  we expect that demand in mexico for our ten mat supported jackup rigs with water depth ratings of feet or less could decline and the future contracting opportunities for such rigs in mexico could diminish 
our mat supported jackup rig fleet in mexico declined during from units at the start of the year to six units as of february  a total of five units were relocated to the us gulf of mexico region  with all of these units stacked until market conditions improve 
we also expect the pride arkansas to be released by pemex at the completion of its contract and we intend to stack the rig when it returns to the united states 
we experienced approximately out of service days for shipyard maintenance and upgrade projects in  including days for deepwater rigs  days for midwater rigs  days for independent leg jackups and days for mat supported jackups  for our existing fleet as compared to  days for for  we expect the number of out of service days to be approximately days  including days for deepwater rigs  days for midwater rigs  days for independent leg rigs and days for mat supported rigs 
shipyard projects may be subject to delays 
for our ultra deepwater drillships under construction  we have attempted to mitigate risks of delay by selecting the same shipyard for all four construction projects with fixed fee contracts  although some of our other risks with respect to these construction projects  such as work stoppages  disputes with the shipyard  shipyard financial and other difficulties and adverse weather conditions  are more concentrated 
backlog our backlog at december   totaled approximately billion for our executed contracts  with billion attributable to our deepwater drillships under construction 
we expect approximately billion of our total backlog to be realized in our backlog at december  was approximately billion 
we calculate our backlog  or future contracted revenue for our offshore fleet  as the contract dayrate multiplied by the number of days remaining on the contract  assuming full utilization 
backlog excludes revenues for mobilization  demobilization  contract preparation  customer reimbursables and performance bonuses 
the amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amount disclosed or expected due to various factors 
downtime due to various operating factors  including unscheduled repairs  maintenance  weather and other factors  may result in lower applicable dayrates than the full contractual operating dayrate  as well as the ability of our customers to terminate contracts under certain circumstances 
the following table reflects the percentage of rig days committed by year as of december  the percentage of rig days committed is calculated as the ratio of total days committed under firm contracts  as well as scheduled shipyard  survey and mobilization days  to total available days in the period 
total available days have been calculated based on the expected delivery dates for our four deepwater rigs under construction 
for the years ending december  rig days committed deepwater midwater jackups independent leg jackups mat supported critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other information and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and  accordingly  these estimates may change as additional information is obtained  as more experience is acquired  as our operating environment changes and as new events occur 
our critical accounting estimates are important to the portrayal of both our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make difficult  subjective or complex assumptions or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we would report different amounts in our consolidated financial statements  which could be material  if we used different assumptions or estimates 
we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates for property and equipment  income taxes and contingent liabilities 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation 
property and equipment property and equipment comprise a significant amount of our total assets 
we determine the carrying value of these assets based on property and equipment policies that incorporate our estimates  assumptions and judgments relative to the carrying value  remaining useful lives and salvage value of our rigs 
we depreciate our property and equipment over the estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
the assumptions and judgments we use in determining the estimated useful lives of our rigs reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of estimated useful lives  especially those involving our rigs  would likely result in materially different net book values of our property and equipment and results of operations 
useful lives of rigs and related equipment are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including technological advances that impact the methods or cost of oil and natural gas exploration and development  changes in market or economic conditions and changes in laws or regulations affecting the drilling industry 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our rigs when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the rig and include changes in operating condition  functional capability and market and economic factors 
we also consider major capital upgrades required to perform certain contracts and the long term impact of those upgrades on the future marketability when assessing the useful lives of individual rigs 
during  we reviewed the useful lives of certain rigs upon completion of shipyard projects  which resulted in extending the useful lives of the rigs  and as a result reduced depreciation expense by million and increased after tax diluted earnings per share by 
during  we completed a technical evaluation of our offshore fleet 
as a result of our evaluation  we increased our estimates of the remaining lives of certain semisubmersible and jackup rigs in our fleet between four and eight years  increased the expected useful lives of our drillships from years to years and our semisubmersibles from years to years  and updated our estimated salvage value for all of our offshore drilling rig fleet to of the historical cost of the rigs 
the effect for of these changes in estimates was a reduction to depreciation expense of approximately million and an after tax increase to diluted earnings per share of 
we review our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may not be recoverable 
indicators of possible impairment include i extended periods of idle time and or an inability to contract specific assets or groups of assets  ii a significant adverse change in business climate  such as a decline in our market value or fleet utilization  or iii an adverse change in the manner or physical condition of a group of assets or a specific asset 
however  the drilling industry is highly cyclical and it is not unusual to find that assets that were idle  under utilized or contracted at sub economic rates for significant periods of time resume activity at economic rates when market conditions improve 
additionally  our rigs are mobile  and we may mobilize rigs from one market to another to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates 
due to the decline in our share price since mid and recent impairment announcements by other companies in our industry  we reviewed our recorded asset values and determined that no impairment was required 
asset impairment evaluations are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the assets being evaluated to determine the recoverability of carrying amounts 
in general  analyses are based on expected costs  utilization and dayrates for the estimated remaining useful lives of the asset or group of assets being assessed 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the aggregate carrying amount is not recoverable 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets  and reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  dayrates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets and could materially affect our results of operations 
income taxes our income tax expense is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we provide for income taxes based on the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income tax rates and methods of computing taxable income vary substantially in each jurisdiction 
our income tax expense is expected to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions and the amount of pre tax income fluctuates 
the determination and evaluation of our annual income tax provision involves the interpretation of tax laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events  such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements  treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our levels of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction may impact our tax liability in any given year 
while our annual tax provision is based on the information available to us at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in certain tax jurisdictions are determined 
current income tax expense reflects an estimate of our income tax liability for the current year  withholding taxes  changes in prior year tax estimates as returns are filed  or from tax audit adjustments 
our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reflected on the balance sheet 
valuation allowances are determined to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to determine the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as of the valuation allowances  we must make estimates and certain assumptions regarding future taxable income  including where the rigs are expected to be deployed  as well as other assumptions related to our future tax position 
a change in such estimates and assumptions  along with any changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets  liabilities  or valuation allowances as discussed below 
as of december   we have foreign net operating loss nol carryforwards  with respect to all of which we have recognized a valuation allowance 
certain foreign nol carryforwards do not expire while others could expire starting in through we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our foreign controlled subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
if a distribution is made to us from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional taxes 
because we cannot predict when  if at all  we will make a distribution of these unremitted earnings  we are unable to make a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability 
as required by law  we file periodic tax returns that are subject to review and examination by various tax authorities within the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are currently contesting several tax assessments and may contest future assessments where we believe the assessments are in error 
we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of existing or future tax assessments  however  we believe the ultimate resolution of outstanding tax assessments will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in  we received tax assessments from the mexican government related to the operations of certain entities for the tax years through as required by statutory requirements  we have provided bonds  which totaled million mexican pesos  or approximately million  as of december   to contest these assessments 
in february  we received additional tax assessments for the tax years and in the amount of  million pesos  or approximately million 
bonds for these assessments are to be provided later in these assessments contest our right to claim certain deductions 
while we intend to contest these assessments vigorously  we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome  which may take several years 
however  we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these assessments will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
additional bonds will need to be provided to the extent future assessments are contested 
we anticipate that the mexican government will make additional assessments contesting similar deductions for other tax years or entities 
we do not believe that it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous underlying factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among other things  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries 
our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have been appropriate  however  past experience is only a guide and the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
contingencies we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liability reserves relate primarily to litigation  personal injury claims  indemnities and potential income and other tax assessments see also income taxes above 
revisions to contingent liability reserves are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter and include our costs to defend 
in situations where we expect insurance proceeds to offset contingent liabilities  we record a receivable for all probable recoveries until the net loss is zero 
we recognize contingent gains when the contingency is resolved and the gain has been realized 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimated contingencies  revisions to the estimated contingency amounts would be required and would be recognized in the period the new information becomes known 
segment review during the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our reportable segments to reflect the general asset class of our drilling rigs 
we believe that this change reflects how we manage our business 
our new reportable segments include deepwater  which consists of our rigs capable of drilling in water depths greater than  feet  and midwater  which consists of our semisubmersible rigs capable of drilling in water depths of  feet or less 
our jackup fleet  which operates in water depths up to feet  is reported as two segments  independent leg jackups and mat supported jackups  based on rig design as well as our intention to separate the mat supported jackup business 
we also manage the drilling operations for three deepwater rigs  which are included in a non reported operating segment along with corporate costs and other operations 
for all periods presented  we have excluded the results of operations of our discontinued operations 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report for additional information regarding discontinued operations 
as a result of our disposal of these operations  certain operating and administrative costs were reallocated for all periods presented to our remaining continuing operating segments 
the following table summarizes our revenues and earnings from continuing operations by our reportable segments for year ended december  revenues in millions deepwater midwater jackups independent leg jackups mat supported other corporate total earnings from continuing operations deepwater midwater jackups independent leg jackups mat supported other corporate total the following table summarizes our average daily revenues and utilization percentage by segment average daily revenues utilization average daily revenues utilization average daily revenues utilization deepwater midwater jackups independent leg jackups mat supported average daily revenues are based on total revenues for each type of rig divided by actual days worked by all rigs of that type 
average daily revenues will differ from average contract dayrate due to billing adjustments for any non productive time  mobilization fees  demobilization fees  performance bonuses and charges to the customer for ancillary services 
utilization is calculated as the total days worked divided by the total days in the period 
deepwater revenues increased million  or  for over as our deepwater units earned higher dayrates  reflecting the strong worldwide demand for deepwater rigs 
the increase in revenues is primarily due to four of our rigs commencing new contracts at higher dayrates  which contributed approximately million of incremental revenues in over the strong performance was also due to the increased utilization of the pride rio de janeiro  which had a increase in days worked in over average daily revenues increased for over primarily due to higher dayrates 
earnings from operations increased million  or  for over due to the increase in revenues and a decrease in depreciation expense from the change in estimate of useful lives effective july the increase in earnings from operations was partially offset by a increase in overall labor costs for our rig crews  and an increase in repair and maintenance costs 
utilization remained relatively unchanged at for as compared to for revenues increased million  or  for over as we benefited from the strong demand for our deepwater rigs  which resulted in higher dayrates and high utilization levels across much of the fleet 
this strong performance was led by the pride south pacific  which contributed approximately million of incremental revenue as a result of an increase in dayrate from  to  with the commencement of a new contract in march the improvement was also due to increased utilization from the pride north america  which had non revenue maintenance and repair downtime in  and an increase of million in revenue from the non cash amortization of deferred revenue related to the pride portland and pride rio de janeiro 
average daily revenues in increased over primarily due to contract dayrate increases 
earnings from operations increased million  or  in over due to an increase in revenues and a decrease in rental expenses resulting from our acquisition in november of the remaining interest in a joint venture company  the principal assets of which were the pride rio de janeiro and the pride portland 
these favorable conditions were offset partially by a increase in overall labor costs for our rig crews 
utilization increased to for from in primarily due to downtime in the fourth quarter of for the pride north america  which sustained crane damage as a result of new equipment failure 
midwater revenues increased million  or  in over principally due to higher contracted dayrates 
three rigs  the pride mexico  the sea explorer and the pride south seas  commenced new contracts in at substantially higher dayrates than their previously contracted rates  these new contracts contributed approximately million in incremental revenue for over partially offsetting the revenue increase was the loss of revenue resulting from out of service time for the pride venezuela and pride south atlantic in for unplanned repairs 
average daily revenues for increased over due to higher dayrates 
earnings from operations increased million  or  for over due to increased revenues offset partially by lost revenue days from planned shipyard projects coupled with repair and maintenance expenses for the pride venezuela and unscheduled maintenance for the pride south atlantic in utilization decreased to for from for the decline in utilization is primarily attributable to unscheduled maintenance and downtime in revenues increased million  or  in over due primarily to higher dayrates 
average daily revenues for increased over due to four of our rigs commencing new contracts in with dayrates that were substantially higher than previously contracted rates 
earnings from operations in increased million over due to higher dayrates across much of our midwater fleet 
overall  utilization of our midwater fleet decreased to in from in the decline in utilization in is primarily due to the pride mexico entering the shipyard in may for upgrade in preparation for its new contract that began in mid in addition  the pride south seas entered the shipyard in september for upgrade and maintenance  lowering its utilization for as compared to jackups independent leg revenues increased million  or  for over primarily due to the increased utilization for the pride hawaii  pride tennessee and pride wisconsin coupled with the incremental revenue from the pride montana  which commenced a new contract in june at a dayrate that was substantially higher than its previously contracted rate 
average daily revenues increased for over primarily due to higher dayrates for the pride cabinda and the pride montana 
earnings from operations in increased million  or  over as a result of increased revenues  partially offset by the loss of revenues from higher downtime for the pride pennsylvania and the pride north dakota 
utilization increased to for from for the increase in utilization is primarily the result of decreased shipyard activity for over revenues increased million  or  in over primarily due to higher dayrates across the fleet 
this dayrate increase was offset partially by the loss of revenue from increased shipyard time in over for the pride hawaii  pride cabinda and pride tennessee 
average daily revenues increased in over principally due to the higher dayrates experienced by the pride hawaii  the pride pennsylvania  the pride wisconsin and the pride tennessee  which all commenced new contracts in at dayrates that were substantially higher than previously contracted rates 
earnings from operations in increased million  or  over as the increase in dayrates exceeded the increases in labor and repair and maintenance costs 
overall  utilization of our independent leg jackup fleet decreased to for from for the decrease in utilization was principally due to downtime experienced by the pride hawaii  the pride cabinda and the pride wisconsin resulting from planned shipyard projects completed in jackups mat supported revenues increased million  or less than  for over due to increased utilization offset by declining dayrates 
average daily revenues decreased for over due to lower dayrates 
the pride wyoming accounted for million  or approximately  of our revenue for earnings from operations decreased million  or  for over due to increased rig and shore based labor costs  higher costs to mobilize and demobilize rigs in and out of mexico and higher repair and maintenance expenses for the pride nevada 
partially offsetting these increases in costs were increased earnings from operations due to increased utilization for the pride texas  which was in the shipyard for all of the third quarter and part of the fourth quarter of utilization increased to for from for the increase in utilization is primarily due to increased activity in the us gulf of mexico in the first three quarters of partially offset by the stacking of the pride utah in late  the pride alabama in april and three additional rigs in late in the fourth quarter of  a decision was made to stack the pride colorado  the pride nevada and the pride south carolina as a result of unfavorable market conditions resulting from declining crude oil and natural gas prices 
revenues increased million  or less than  in over primarily due to lower utilization in the us partially offset by dayrate increases in mexico 
average daily revenue for our mat supported jackup fleet increased for over as our rigs in mexico recontracted at higher dayrates 
earnings from operations in decreased million  or  over due to lower utilization 
in october  the pride alabama experienced a lightning strike from severe storms in mexico and required days to repair 
overall  utilization of our mat supported jackup fleet decreased to for from in due to weaker demand for rigs in the us  which resulted in increases in idle time between drilling contracts 
other operations other operations include our drilling operations for three deepwater drilling rigs under management contracts that expire in  and with early termination permitted in certain cases and two deepwater drilling rigs under management contracts that ended in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  our platform rigs that were sold in may and other operating activities 
revenues decreased million  or  for over primarily due to a reduction in revenues resulting from the sale of our platform rig fleet in may and suspension of drilling services  and the subsequent termination of our management services contract  on the kizomba a deepwater rig in the third quarter of we earned approximately million in management fee revenues in for the kizomba a 
earnings from operations decreased million  or  for over primarily due to the gain on the sale of our barge rig  bintang kalimantan  in december coupled with higher labor costs and transportation costs in mexico in  partially offset by the gain on sale of our platform fleet 
revenues increased million  or  in over primarily as a result of higher dayrates  higher utilization for our platform rigs and higher rates for our managed rigs  partially offset by our reduction in labor services contracts and swamp barge rig operations 
in december  we sold our barge rig the bintang kalimantan  which had been idle since early  resulting in a gain on sale of million 
earnings from operations increased million  or  for over primarily due to the gain on the sale of the bintang kalimantan

our consolidated effective income tax rate for continuing operations for was compared with for the lower rate for was principally the result of increased income in lower taxed jurisdictions coupled with the recognition of benefits derived from previously unrecognized foreign tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources our objective in financing our business is to maintain both adequate financial resources and access to additional liquidity 
our million senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides back up liquidity to meet our on going working capital needs 
at december   we had million of availability under this facility 
during  we used cash on hand including from asset sales and cash flows generated from operations as our primary source of liquidity for funding our working capital needs  debt repayment and capital expenditures 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash flows from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity through to fund our working capital needs  scheduled debt repayments and anticipated capital expenditures  including progress payments for our four drillship construction projects 
in addition  we will continue to pursue opportunities to expand or upgrade our fleet  which could result in additional capital investment 
subject to the limitations imposed by our existing debt arrangements  we may also in the future elect to return capital to our stockholders by share repurchases or the payment of dividends 
we may review from time to time possible expansion and acquisition opportunities relating to our business  which may include the construction or acquisition of rigs or acquisitions of other businesses in addition to those described in this annual report 
any determination to construct additional rigs for our fleet will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time  including the availability of long term contracts with sufficient dayrates for the rigs and the relative costs of building new rigs with advanced capabilities compared with the costs of retrofitting or converting existing rigs to provide similar capabilities 
the timing  size or success of any additional acquisition or construction effort and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable 
we may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and or equity issuances 
debt or equity financing may not  however  be available to us at that time due to a variety of events  including  among others  credit rating agency downgrades of our debt  industry conditions  general economic conditions  market conditions and market perceptions of us and our industry 
we also review from time to time the possible disposition of assets that we do not consider core to our strategic long term business plan 
as discussed above  we have filed a form registration statement with the securities and exchange commission with respect to the distribution to our stockholders of all of the shares of common stock of a subsidiary that would hold  directly or indirectly  the assets and liabilities of our rig mat supported jackup business 
for additional information about the spin off  please read recent developments separation of our mat supported jackup business

we also received net proceeds of million and million from employee stock transactions in and  respectively 
cash flows from discontinued operations our discontinued operations were largely dependent on us for funding of capital expenditures  strategic investments and acquisitions 
the discontinued operations would periodically distribute to us available cash through intercompany invoices or capital dividends or require us to fund their operations through intercompany working capital or capital investments 
for  we provided net cash of million from discontinued operations as compared to receiving cash of million for our cash flows used in operating activities of discontinued operations for were million compared with cash flows provided of million for the decrease in cash flows from operations was due primarily to the inclusion in of eight months of operations of our latin america land and e p services segments prior to the disposal 
purchases of property and equipment were million for compared with million for we do not believe that  in the future  the loss of the cash flows from our discontinued operations will significantly affect our liquidity or ability to fund our capital expenditures 
sources and uses of cash compared with cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows from operations were million for compared with for the increase in cash flows from operations was primarily due to the increase in our income from continuing operations partially offset by increased use of cash for working capital items

moody s and standard poor s report a positive outlook  while fitch s outlook is stable 
revolving credit facility in december  we entered into a new million unsecured revolving credit agreement with a group of banks maturing in december borrowings under the credit facility are available to make investments  acquisitions and capital expenditures  to repay and back up commercial paper and for other general corporate purposes 
we may obtain up to million of letters of credit under the facility 
the credit facility also has an accordion feature that would  under certain circumstances  allow us to increase the availability under the facility to up to million 
amounts drawn under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus a margin or the alternative base rate 
the interest rate margin applicable to libor advances varies based on our credit rating 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility  and our borrowing availability was million 
the credit facility contains a number of covenants restricting  among other things  liens  indebtedness of our subsidiaries  mergers and dispositions of all or substantially all of our or certain of our subsidiaries assets  agreements limiting the ability of subsidiaries to make dividends  distributions or other payments to us or other subsidiaries  affiliate transactions  hedging arrangements outside the ordinary course of business  and sale leaseback transactions 
the facility also requires us to maintain certain ratios with respect to earnings to interest expenses and debt to tangible capitalization 
the facility contains customary events of default  including with respect to a change of control 
in connection with the closing under our new credit facility  we terminated our then existing million senior secured credit facility 
we incurred no termination penalties and recognized a charge of million related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs in connection with the termination 
other outstanding debt as of december   in addition to our credit facility  we had the following long term debt  including current maturities  outstanding million principal amount of senior notes due  and million principal amount of notes guaranteed by the united states maritime administration 
our senior notes contain provisions that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to enter into transactions with affiliates  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  incur debt or issue preferred stock  enter into agreements containing dividend or other payment restrictions affecting our subsidiaries  dispose of assets  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  create liens  and consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
many of these restrictions will terminate if the notes are rated investment grade by either s p or moody s and  in either case  the notes have a specified minimum rating by the other rating agency 
we are required to offer to repurchase the notes in connection with specified change in control events that result in a ratings decline 
our notes guaranteed by the united states maritime administration were used to finance a portion of the cost of construction of the pride portland and pride rio de janeiro 
the notes bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of  mature in and are prepayable  in whole or in part  at any time  subject to a make whole premium 
the notes are collateralized by the two rigs and the net proceeds received by subsidiary project companies chartering the rigs 
in april  we called for redemption all of the outstanding convertible senior notes due in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes 
the redemption price was of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest to the redemption date 
holders of the notes could elect to convert the notes into our common stock at a rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes  at any time prior to the redemption date 
holders of the notes elected to convert a total of million aggregate principal amount of the notes  and the remaining  aggregate principal amount was redeemed by us on the redemption date 
we delivered an aggregate of approximately million in cash and approximately million shares of common stock in connection with the retirement of the notes 
although we do not expect that our level of total indebtedness will have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity in future periods  it may limit our flexibility in certain areas 
please read risk factors our significant debt levels and debt agreement restrictions may limit our liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities in item a of this annual report 
other sources and uses of cash we expect our purchases of property and equipment for  excluding our new drillship commitments  to be approximately million for refurbishment and upgrade of our rigs and million for critical spares and other ancillary projects 
these purchases are expected to be used primarily for various rig upgrades in connection with new contracts as contracts expire during the year along with other sustaining capital projects 
with respect to our four deepwater drillships currently under construction  the total remaining costs are estimated to be approximately billion  of which approximately billion is committed at december  we anticipate making additional payments for the construction of these drillships of approximately million in  approximately million in and approximately million in we expect to fund construction of these rigs through available cash  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we anticipate making income tax payments of approximately million to million in mobilization fees received from customers and the costs incurred to mobilize a rig from one geographic area to another  as well as up front fees to modify a rig to meet a customer s specifications  are deferred and amortized over the term of the related drilling contracts 
these up front fees and costs impact liquidity in the period in which the fees are received or the costs incurred  whereas they will impact our statement of operations in the periods during which the deferred revenues and costs are amortized 
the amount of up front fees received and the related costs vary from period to period depending upon the nature of new contracts entered into and market conditions then prevailing 
generally  contracts for drilling services in remote locations or contracts that require specialized equipment will provide for higher up front fees than contracts for readily available equipment in major markets 
additionally  we defer costs associated with obtaining in class certification from various regulatory bodies in order to operate our offshore rigs 
we amortize these costs over the period of validity of the related certificate 
we may redeploy additional assets to more active regions if we have the opportunity to do so on attractive terms 
we frequently bid for or negotiate with customers regarding multi year contracts that could require significant capital expenditures and mobilization costs 
we expect to fund project opportunities primarily through a combination of working capital  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in addition to the matters described in this liquidity and capital resources section  please read business outlook and segment review for additional matters that may have a material impact on our liquidity 
letters of credit we are contingently liable as of december  in the aggregate amount of million under certain performance  bid and custom bonds and letters of credit 
as of december   we had not been required to make any collateral deposits with respect to these agreements 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our contractual obligations as of december  some of the figures we include in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration and other factors 
the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective 
less than after total year years years years in millions recorded contractual obligations principal payments on long term debt trade payables other long term liabilities unrecorded contractual obligations interest payments on long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations drillship construction agreements total amounts represent the expected cash payments for our total long term debt and do not reflect any unamortized discount 
amounts represent other liabilities related to severance and termination benefits and capital leases 
amounts represent the expected cash payments for interest on our long term debt based on the interest rates in place and amounts outstanding at december  we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the leases 
our future operating lease payments would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
includes approximately million in purchase obligations related to drillship construction projects 
includes shipyard payments under drillship construction agreements for our four drillship construction projects 
as of december   we have approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  including penalties and interest 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with the liabilities recognized in this balance  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
pending accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  business combinations 
under sfas no 
r  all business combinations will be accounted for by applying the acquisition method and an acquirer is required to be identified for each business combination 
sfas no 
r defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination  establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control and requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest at their fair values as of the acquisition date 
sfas no 
r also requires transaction costs and restructuring charges to be expensed 
effective january   we will begin applying this statement to any business combination completed by us 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which is an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  sfas no 
requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent s owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary 
this statement is effective for the fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  we adopted sfas no 
on january  but its adoption did not have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
fsp apb will apply to any convertible debt instrument that may be wholly or partially settled in cash and will require the separation of the debt and equity components of cash settleable convertibles at the date of issuance 
the value assigned to the debt component is the estimated value of similar debt instrument without the conversion feature 
the difference between the proceeds received and the estimated value of the debt component will be recorded as additional paid in capital 
the difference between the estimated value of the debt at issuance and the par value at the redemption date will be accreted to interest expense over the estimated life of the convertible debt 
fsp apb is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and must be applied retroactively to all periods presented 
early adoption of this fsp is prohibited 
we expect the adoption of fsp apb to result in a non cash increase of our historical interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  of million  million and million for  and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
these risks arise primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk  but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates through our fixed rate long term debt 
typically  the fair market value of fixed rate long term debt will increase as prevailing interest rates decrease and will decrease as prevailing interest rates increase 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices where applicable  or based on the present value of expected cash flows relating to the debt discounted at rates currently available to us for long term borrowings with similar terms and maturities 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt as of december  and was million and  million  respectively  which was more than its carrying value as of december  and of million and  million  respectively 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates relative to market interest rates at december  would increase the fair market value of our long term debt at december  by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we operate in a number of international areas and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we utilize local currency borrowings and the payment structure of customer contracts to selectively reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies 
we also utilize derivative instruments to hedge forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions 
at december   we had contracts outstanding to exchange an aggregate million us dollars to hedge against the change in value of forecasted payroll transactions and related costs denominated in euros 
we had no such contracts outstanding as of december  if we were to incur a hypothetical adverse change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  the net unrealized loss associated with our foreign currency denominated exchange contracts as of december  would be approximately million 
we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts  option contracts or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
