item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
st 
gabriel  la mercury vapor emissions release our subsidiary  pioneer  discovered in october that the carbon based system used to remove mercury from the hydrogen gas stream at the st 
gabriel  la facility was not at that time sufficiently effective  resulting in mercury vapor emissions that were above the permit limits approved by the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq 
pioneer immediately reduced the plant s operating rate and  in late november  completed the installation of the necessary equipment and made the other needed changes  and the plant resumed its normal operations 
pioneer s emissions monitoring since that time confirmed that the air emissions are below the permit limits 
in january  the ldeq issued a violation notice to pioneer as a result of this mercury vapor emissions release 
in december  the ldeq issued a penalty assessment of million with respect to the notice of violation 
pioneer has administratively appealed the penalty assessment 
given the facts and circumstances  pioneer requested that the ldeq reconsider the penalty assessment 
other as part of the continuing environmental investigation by federal  state  and local governments of waste disposal sites  we have entered into a number of settlement agreements requiring us to participate in the investigation and cleanup of a number of sites 
under the terms of such settlements and related agreements  we may be required to manage or perform one or more elements of a site cleanup  or to manage the entire remediation activity for a number of parties  and subsequently seek recovery of some or all of such costs from other potentially responsible parties prps 
in many cases  we do not know the ultimate costs of our settlement obligations at the time of entering into particular settlement agreements  and our liability accruals for our obligations under those agreements are often subject to significant management judgment on an ongoing basis 
those cost accruals are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and our accounting policies set forth in the environmental matters section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we  and our subsidiaries  are defendants in various other legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos incidental to our past and current business activities 
while we believe that none of these legal actions will materially adversely affect our financial position  in light of the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot at this time determine whether the financial impact  if any  of these matters will be material to our results of operations

part ii item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities as of january   we had  record holders of our common stock 
our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange

through december    shares had been repurchased  and  shares remain available for purchase under that program  which has no termination date 
performance graph this graph compares the total shareholder return on our common stock with the total return on the i standard and poor s index the s p  ii the current peer group  iii standard poor s midcap and iv the former peer group 
our current peer group is comprised of georgia gulf corporation  occidental petroleum corporation  alliant techsystems  ppg industries  inc  the dow chemical company and westlake chemical corporation  and our former peer group consists of georgia gulf corporation  brush engineered materials inc  mueller industries  inc  and wolverine tube  inc 
our board adjusted the peer group to better reflect our current lines of business after the sale of our metals business and the acquisition of pioneer companies 
our board believes that the s p and the new peer group provide a better and more accurate basis to compare our performance  as the compensation committee uses the materials companies from the s p along with our current peer group for certain benchmarks in executive compensation 
stock performance graph data is for the five year period from december  through december  the cumulative return includes reinvestment of dividends 
both the current peer group and the former peer group are weighted in accordance with market capitalization closing stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding as of the beginning of each of the five years covered by the performance graph 
we calculated the weighted return for each year by multiplying a the percentage that each corporation s market capitalization represented of the total market capitalization for all corporations in that peer group for such year by b the total shareholder return for that corporation for such year

employee data exclude employees who worked at government owned contractor operated facilities 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business background the metals business was classified as discontinued operations during and was excluded from the segment results for all periods presented 
as a result  our manufacturing operations are concentrated in two business segments chlor alkali products and winchester 
both are capital intensive manufacturing businesses with operating rates closely tied to the general economy 
each segment has a commodity element to it  and therefore  our ability to influence pricing is quite limited on the portion of the segment s business that is strictly commodity 
our chlor alkali products business is a commodity business where all supplier products are similar and price is the major supplier selection criterion 
we have little or no ability to influence prices in this large  global commodity market 
cyclical price swings  driven by changes in supply demand  can be abrupt and significant and  given capacity in our chlor alkali products business  can lead to very significant changes in our overall profitability 
winchester also has a commodity element to its business  but a majority of winchester ammunition is sold as a branded consumer product where there are opportunities to differentiate certain offerings through innovative new product development and enhanced product performance 
while competitive pricing versus other branded ammunition products is important  it is not the only factor in product selection 
recent developments and highlights year in  chlor alkali products had record segment income of million  an improvement of compared with the prior year 
this improvement reflects the combination of the full year contributions from the pioneer acquisition of million  including synergies  and improved pricing of million 
these were partially offset by the effect from lower chlorine and caustic soda volumes of million 
operating rates in our chlor alkali products business were for and were negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of by lower levels of demand from major customer groups  and by hurricane related outages at our st 
gabriel  la facility and our sunbelt joint venture during the third quarter of in response to the low level of demand during the fourth quarter of  we announced that the st 
gabriel  la facility  which was shutdown for scheduled maintenance in late november  will not resume operations until the current conversion and expansion project is completed 
the project is expected to be completed in the second quarter of the st 
gabriel  la facility represents approximately of our chlorine and caustic soda capacity 
during the first three quarters of  demand for caustic soda remained strong 
however  caustic soda supply was constrained by the weakness in chlorine demand  which caused operating rates to be reduced 
this created an imbalance between caustic soda supply and demand 
this imbalance  combined with increased freight and energy costs  resulted in record levels of caustic soda pricing 
during the fourth quarter of  caustic soda demand weakened but less than the decline in chlorine demand 
this caused the caustic soda supply and demand imbalance to continue  which continued to support caustic soda prices 
on march   we announced that  in connection with our plans to streamline chlor alkali manufacturing operations in canada in order to serve our customer base in a more cost effective manner  we would close the acquired dalhousie  new brunswick  canada chlorine  caustic soda  sodium chlorate  and bleach operations 
we substantially completed the closure of the dalhousie facility by june  we expect to incur cash expenditures of million associated with the shutdown  which were previously included in current liabilities on the pioneer acquisition balance sheet 
we have paid million of costs associated with this shutdown as of december  this action is expected to generate million to million of annual pretax savings 
winchester segment income was million in  which represented record earnings for the winchester business  an increase of compared with the prior year 
winchester s results for reflected the combination of improved pricing and increased law enforcement volumes which more than offset higher commodity  material and manufacturing costs 
in  other expense income included an impairment charge of the full value of a million investment in corporate debt securities 
on october   the issuer of these debt securities announced it would cease trading and appoint a receiver as a result of financial market turmoil 
the decline in the market value of the assets supporting these debt securities negatively impacted the liquidity of the issuer 
during the third quarter of  we determined that these debt securities had no fair market value due to the actions taken by the issuer  turmoil in the financial markets  the lack of liquidity of the issuer  and the lack of trading in these debt securities 
we are currently unable to utilize the capital loss resulting from the impairment of these corporate debt securities  therefore  no tax benefit was recognized during for the impairment loss 
in  the defined benefit pension plan s investment portfolio declined by approximately 
the decline reflected the weakness in the domestic and international equity markets and increases in interest rate spreads  which reduced the value of certain corporate fixed income investments 
the pension plan s investment performance reflects the actions taken in to reduce the defined benefit pension plan s exposure to equity investments and increase its exposure to fixed income investments 
during the same period  interest rates on corporate bonds  used to determine the defined benefit pension plan s liability discount rate  fluctuated dramatically during the year but ended comparable with the levels at december   which resulted in no change to the discount rate for we recorded an after tax charge of million million pretax to shareholders equity as of december  for our pension and other postretirement plans  which reduced the over funded position in our pension plan that existed at december  this charge reflected the unfavorable performance on pension plan assets and the unchanged discount rate during based on the current funding requirements  we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic defined benefit pension plan at least through year discontinued operations in  the industry in which the metals business operates experienced a decline in volumes that created over capacity in the marketplace  which reduced our financial returns in the metals business 
volumes did not return to pre levels 
since  we had undertaken a number of restructuring and downsizing actions  including multiple plant closures 
the benefits of these actions were more than offset by the escalation of both energy and commodity metal prices  specifically copper  zinc  and nickel 
as a result  we were unable to realize acceptable returns in the business 
during the second half of and first half of  we evaluated a number of strategic alternatives for the metals business  and we made the decision in mid to engage goldman  sachs co 
to conduct a formal strategic evaluation process  including the alternative of selling the business 
the sale of metals provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue investments in areas where we can earn the best returns 
on october   we announced we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the metals business to global for million  payable in cash 
the price received was subject to a customary working capital adjustment 
the sale was subject to hart scott rodino antitrust improvement act clearance  but not shareholder approval 
the transaction closed on november  based on the metals assets held for sale  we recognized a pretax loss of million partially offset by a million income tax benefit  resulting in a net loss on disposal of discontinued operations of million for the loss on disposal of discontinued operations included a pension curtailment charge of million  other postretirement benefits curtailment credit of million and estimated transaction fees of million 
the final loss recognized related to this transaction will be dependent upon the final determination of the value of working capital in the business 
the loss on the disposal  which included transaction costs  reflected a book value of the metals business of approximately million and a tax basis of approximately million 
the difference between the book and tax values of the business reflected primarily goodwill of million and intangibles of million 
based on an estimated working capital adjustment  we anticipated net cash proceeds from the transaction of million  which was in addition to the million of after tax cash flow realized from the operation of metals during in april  we and global entered into binding arbitration regarding the final working capital adjustment 
the arbitration is expected to be concluded in the metals business was a reportable segment comprised of principal manufacturing facilities in east alton  il and montpelier  oh 
metals produced and distributed copper and copper alloy sheet  strip  foil  rod  welded tube  fabricated parts  and stainless steel and aluminum strip 
sales for the metals business were  million and  million for the period of our ownership in and  respectively 
the metals business sales included commodity metal price changes that are primarily a pass through 
intersegment sales of million and million for the period of our ownership in and  respectively  representing the sale of ammunition cartridge case cups to winchester from metals  at prices that approximate market  have been eliminated from metals sales 
in conjunction with the sale of the metals business  winchester agreed to purchase the majority of its ammunition cartridge case cups and copper based strip requirements from global under a multi year agreement with pricing  terms  and conditions which approximate market 
the metals business employed approximately  hourly and salaried employees 
the results of operations from the metals business have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in conjunction with the sale of the metals business  we retained certain assets and liabilities including certain assets co located with our winchester business in east alton  il  assets and liabilities associated with former metals manufacturing locations  pension assets and pension and postretirement healthcare and life insurance liabilities associated with metals employees for service earned through the date of sale  and certain environmental obligations existing at the date of closing associated with current and past metals manufacturing operations and waste disposal sites 
pioneer acquisition on august   we acquired pioneer  a manufacturer of chlorine  caustic soda  bleach  sodium chlorate  and hydrochloric acid 
pioneer owned and operated four chlor alkali plants and several bleach manufacturing facilities in north america 
under the merger agreement  each share of pioneer common stock was converted into the right to receive in cash  without interest 
the aggregate purchase price for all of pioneer s outstanding shares of common stock  together with the aggregate payment due to holders of options to purchase shares of common stock of pioneer  was million  which includes direct fees and expenses 
we financed the merger with cash and million of borrowings against our accounts receivable securitization facility accounts receivable facility 
at the date of acquisition  pioneer had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we assumed million of pioneer s convertible debt which was redeemed in the fourth quarter of and january we paid a conversion premium of million on the pioneer convertible debt 
for and the last four months of  pioneer sales were million and million  respectively  and segment income was million and million  respectively  which were included in our chlor alkali products segment results 
as a result of acquiring pioneer  we anticipate realizing million to million of annual cost savings from integrating the pioneer operations and our operations within two years from the date of the acquisition 
since august  chlor alkali products segment earnings included approximately million of realized synergies 
the ability to optimize freight costs has been a key synergy realized as part of the pioneer acquisition 
in and  we identified and implemented changes in ship to and ship from of both operations locations that have reduced annual chlorine ton miles shipped by approximately 
the opportunity to rationalize selling and administration costs was also a significant cost savings realized as part of the pioneer acquisition 
during the first quarter of  the pioneer corporate office in houston was closed  the space was subleased  and all of those activities were consolidated into our existing functions and facilities 
financing in august  we entered into a million letter of credit facility to assume the various pioneer letters of credit issued principally to support the acquisition of materials for the st 
gabriel  la facility conversion and expansion project 
on october   we entered into a new five year senior revolving credit facility of million  which replaced the million senior revolving credit facility 
during the first quarter of  we increased our senior revolving credit facility by million to million by adding a new lending institution 
the new senior revolving credit facility will expire in october we have the option to expand the million senior revolving credit facility by an additional million through adding a maximum of two additional lending institutions each year 
borrowing options and restrictive covenants are similar to those of our previous million senior revolving credit facility 
the million senior revolving credit facility includes a million letter of credit subfacility which is in addition to the million letter of credit facility 
on june   we entered into the million day revolving credit facility million credit facility and the million day revolving credit facility million credit facility 
according to their terms  the million credit facility matured on the earlier of june  or upon an increase in the lending commitments under our existing senior revolving credit facility and the establishment of an accounts receivable securitization facility  and the million credit facility would have matured on june  in the fourth quarter of  the million credit facility expired as all conditions for early termination were met and the million credit facility was terminated as we no longer needed the credit commitment 
on july   we established a million  day accounts receivable facility  renewable annually for five years  which expires in july as a result of the sale of metals  the accounts receivable facility was reduced from million to million 
in july  the accounts receivable facility was reduced from million to million 
the million accounts receivable facility provides for the sale of our eligible trade receivables to third party conduits through a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose entity that is consolidated for financial statement purposes 
year in april  we reached an agreement in principle and expected a settlement with the internal revenue service irs on certain outstanding federal tax exposures 
on july   the settlement was finalized 
this settlement  which included the periods to  related primarily to the tax treatment of capital losses generated in we made payments of million  million  and million in  and  respectively  to the irs and various state and local jurisdictions  which was less than the amount previously reserved 
as a result  income tax expense in was reduced by million associated with the settlement and other tax matters 
on june   we commenced an offer to exchange a new series of notes due in and cash for up to million of the million senior notes due in notes 
on july   we announced that approximately million aggregate principal amount of the notes had been validly tendered for exchange 
since more than million of the notes had been tendered  the new notes were issued on a pro rata basis in accordance with the terms of the exchange offer 
on july   we issued million of senior notes due in notes and paid a premium of million to the existing note holders in exchange for million of notes 
we expensed million of third party fees associated with the exchange 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million insurance recovery for hurricane katrina business interruption experienced in our chlor alkali products operations in and early chlor alkali products pricing in accordance with industry practice  we compare ecu prices on a netback basis  reporting and analyzing prices net of the cost of transporting the products to customers to allow for a comparable means of price comparisons between periods and with respect to our competitors 
for purposes of determining our ecu netback  we use prices that we realize as a result of sales of chlorine and caustic soda to our customers  and we do not include the value of chlorine and caustic soda that is incorporated in other products that we manufacture and sell 
quarterly and annual average ecu netbacks  excluding sunbelt  for   and were as follows  which includes pioneer ecu netbacks subsequent to august  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter annual average beginning in late  driven by reduced levels of chlorine demand and a series of planned and unplanned plant maintenance outages  chlor alkali plant operating rates for the industry were reduced 
while this allowed chlorine supply to stay balanced  it caused caustic soda demand  which did not experience a decline  to exceed supply 
this led to industry wide caustic soda price increases 
during the first three quarters of  north american demand for caustic soda remained strong 
however  caustic soda supply continued to be constrained by the weakness in chlorine demand  which caused operating rates to be reduced 
this resulted in a significant supply and demand imbalance for caustic soda in north america 
this imbalance  combined with increased freight and energy costs  resulted in our achieving record levels of caustic soda pricing 
during the fourth quarter of  north american caustic soda demand weakened but less than the decline in chlorine demand 
this caused the caustic soda supply and demand imbalance to continue  which continued to support record levels of caustic soda prices 
while we have seen sequential improvements in caustic soda pricing beginning with the fourth quarter of  we have continued to experience weaker chlorine prices 
chlorine prices have declined quarterly since the third quarter of pension and postretirement benefits in october  we announced that we would freeze our defined benefit pension plan for salaried and certain non bargaining hourly employees 
affected employees were eligible to accrue pension benefits through december   but are not accruing any additional benefits under the plan after that date 
employee service after december  does count toward meeting the vesting requirements for such pension benefits and the eligibility requirements for commencing a pension benefit  but not toward the calculation of the pension benefit amount 
compensation earned after december  similarly does not count toward the determination of the pension benefit amounts under the defined benefit pension plan 
in lieu of continuing pension benefit accruals for the affected employees under the pension plan  starting in  we provide a contribution to an individual retirement contribution account maintained with the contributing employee ownership plan ceop equal to of the employee s eligible compensation if such employee is less than age  and of the employee s eligible compensation if such employee is age or older 
freezing the defined benefit pension plan for salaried and certain non bargaining hourly employees was accounted for as a curtailment under sfas no 
 employer s accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plan and for termination benefits sfas no 

as a result of freezing the defined benefit plan  we recorded a curtailment charge of million for the defined benefit pension plan and a corresponding curtailment credit of million for the non qualified pension plan in we account for our defined benefit pension plans using actuarial models required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 

this model uses an attribution approach that generally spreads the financial impact of changes to the plan and actuarial assumptions over a period of time 
changes in liability due to changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate  rate of compensation increases and mortality  as well as annual deviations between what was assumed and what was experienced by the plan are treated as gains or losses 
the principle underlying the required attribution approach is that employees render service over their average remaining service lives on a relatively smooth basis and  therefore  the accounting for benefits earned under the pension or non pension postretirement benefits plans should follow the same relatively smooth pattern 
with the freezing of our defined benefit pension plan for salaried and certain non bargained hourly employees that became effective january  and the sale of the metals business  substantially all defined benefit pension plan participants were inactive  therefore  actuarial gains and losses are now being amortized based upon the remaining life expectancy of the inactive plan participants rather than the future service period of the active participants  which was the amortization period used prior to at december   the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants in the defined benefit pension plan was years  compared to the average remaining service lives of the active employees in the defined benefit pension plan of years 
at december   the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants in the defined benefit pension plan was years 
during the third quarter of  the pension protection act of  amended by the worker  retiree  and employer recovery act  during the fourth quarter of  became law 
among the stated objectives of the laws are the protection of both pension beneficiaries and the financial health of the pbgc 
to accomplish these objectives  the new laws require sponsors to fund defined benefit pension plans earlier than previous requirements and to pay increased pbgc premiums 
the laws require defined benefit plans to be fully funded in in september  we made a voluntary pension plan contribution of million and in may  we made an additional million voluntary contribution to our defined benefit pension plan 
during  the asset allocation in the plan was adjusted to insulate the plan from discount rate risk and reduce the plan s exposure to equity investments 
based on the combination of these actions and favorable asset performance in and  offset by the unfavorable performance on plan assets in  we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic defined benefit pension plan at least through at december   the projected benefit obligation of our defined pension plan of  million exceeded the market value of assets in our defined pension plan by million 
under sfas no 
 we recorded an after tax charge of million million pretax to shareholders equity as of december  for our pension and other postretirement plans 
this charge reflected the unfavorable performance on plan assets during in  we recorded a million after tax credit million pretax to shareholders equity as of december  for our pension and other postretirement plans 
this credit reflected a basis point increase in the plans discount rate  combined with an increase in the value of the plan assets from favorable plan performance and the million contribution 
in  we recorded an after tax credit of million million pretax to shareholders equity as a result of a decrease in the accumulated pension benefit obligation  which resulted primarily from a basis point increase in the plan discount rate  combined with an increase in the value of the plan assets from favorable plan performance and the million contribution 
in  we adopted sfas no 
 which required us to record a net liability or asset to report the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on our balance sheet 
as a result  we recorded after tax charges to shareholders equity of million and million for the pension and other postretirement plans  respectively  million and million pretax  respectively 
the non cash credits or charges to shareholders equity do not affect our ability to borrow under our revolving credit agreement 
components of net periodic benefit income costs were in millions pension benefits other postretirement benefits in  we recorded curtailment charges of million associated with the transition of a portion of our east alton  il winchester hourly workforce and our mcintosh  al chlor alkali hourly workforce from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution pension plan 
in  we recorded a defined benefit pension curtailment charge of million and other postretirement benefits curtailment credit of million related to the sale of the metals business  which were included in the loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
also during  we recorded a curtailment charge of million resulting from the conversion of a portion of the metals hourly workforce from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution pension plan 
this curtailment charge was included in income from discontinued operations 
in  we recorded pension curtailment charges of million and million resulting from a portion of the winchester and metals hourly workforces  respectively  who voluntarily elected to transition from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution pension plan 
the metals portion of this curtailment charge was included in income from discontinued operations 
after giving effect to the changes in curtailment charges and credits  the decrease in net periodic pension expense from was due to the favorable impact of the million voluntary contribution made in may  the favorable investment returns  a basis point increase in the liability discount rate in  the impact of the plan freeze for salaried and non bargained hourly employees that became effective january   and an increase in the amortization period for actuarial losses 
after giving effect to the changes in curtailment charges and credits  the decrease in net periodic pension expense from was due to the combination of a basis point increase in discount rate for  the voluntary contributions to our defined benefit pension plan of million in may and million in september  and the favorable performance on plan assets in the service cost and the amortization of prior service cost components of pension expense related to employees of the operating segments are allocated to the operating segments based on their respective estimated census data 
therefore  the allocated portion of net periodic benefit costs for the metals business of million and million for the period of our ownership in and  respectively  was included in income from discontinued operations 
the portion of other postretirement benefit costs for the metals business employees of million and million for the period of our ownership in and  respectively  was also included in income from discontinued operations

chlor alkali products sales increased by million  or  primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of pioneer sales in compared with four months in and higher ecu prices 
the acquisition of pioneer contributed to an increase in sales of million compared to winchester sales increased by million  or  from primarily due to increased selling prices and improved law enforcement volumes 
gross margin increased million  or  from  as a result of improved chlor alkali products gross margin  primarily due to the contribution from pioneer  and improved winchester gross margin from higher selling prices 
gross margin was also positively impacted by decreased environmental costs in of million primarily associated with a charge in the prior year related to costs at a former waste disposal site based on revised remediation estimates resulting from negotiations with a government agency and the reduction in defined benefit pension expense of million  which was partially offset by an increase in defined contribution pension expense of million 
gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to in from in selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were in and in selling and administration expenses in were million higher than primarily due to expenses associated with the acquired pioneer operations  net of synergies  million  a higher provision for doubtful customer accounts receivable million increased stock based compensation expense million  primarily resulting from mark to market adjustments  higher consulting costs million and increased salary and benefit costs million 
these increases were partially offset by decreased defined benefit pension expense million  offset by increased defined contribution pension expense million 
other operating income for included million for a portion of a gain realized on an intangible asset sale in chlor alkali products  which is recognized ratably through  million for a portion of a gain realized on the sale of equipment  which is recognized ratably through june  and million of a gain on the disposition of land associated with a former manufacturing facility 
these gains were partially offset by a loss of million on the disposition of property  plant and equipment 
other operating income for included the receipt of a million contingent payment associated with a divestiture and million for a portion of a gain realized on an intangible asset sale in chlor alkali products 
the earnings of non consolidated affiliates were million for  a decrease of million from lower volumes at sunbelt  due to the impact of hurricane related outages and other force majeure events at one of its chlorine customers  were partially offset by higher ecu prices 
interest expense decreased by million  or  in  primarily due to a lower level of outstanding debt and capitalization of million of interest in associated with our st 
gabriel  la facility conversion and expansion project and a major maintenance capital project at our mcintosh  al facility 
interest income decreased by million  or  in primarily due to lower short term interest rates 
other expense income for included an impairment charge of the full value of a million investment in corporate debt securities 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations for included expense of million for a valuation allowance required against the deferred tax benefit generated from the impairment of corporate debt securities 
as we are currently unable to utilize the capital loss resulting from the impairment of the million of corporate debt securities  no tax benefit was recognized during for the impairment loss 
additionally  the effective tax rate for continuing operations for included a million reduction in expense primarily associated with the finalization of the income tax returns which resulted in an increased benefit for the domestic manufacturing deduction 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations for of  which was increased by the effect of these two items of million  was higher than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes  which were offset in part by the benefit of the domestic manufacturing deduction and the utilization of certain state tax credits 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations for of was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of the domestic manufacturing deduction and the utilization of certain state tax credits  offset in part by state income taxes and income in certain foreign jurisdictions being taxed at higher rates 
compared to for  total company sales were  million compared with  million last year  an increase of million  or 
chlor alkali products sales increased by million  or  primarily due to the inclusion of pioneer sales for four months in  totaling million offset by lower ecu prices and slightly lower shipment volumes from the prior year from our chlor alkali operations  excluding pioneer

gross margin decreased million  or  from  primarily as a result of higher environmental costs of million primarily associated with an increase in costs at a former waste disposal site based on revised remediation estimates resulting from negotiations with a government agency 
chlor alkali products gross margins declined slightly as the favorable results from the acquisition of pioneer were offset by lower ecu pricing and slightly lower shipment volumes 
this increase in environmental costs and lower chlor alkali margins were partially offset by lower pension costs and improved winchester gross margins from higher selling prices and improved volumes 
gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in this margin percentage decrease reflects higher environmental costs and lower chlor alkali margins offset in part by the higher winchester selling prices and lower pension costs 
selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were in and in selling and administration expenses in were million higher than primarily due to expenses associated with the acquired pioneer operations million  higher management incentive compensation costs partially resulting from mark to market adjustments on stock based compensation million and increased salary and benefit costs million 
these increases were mostly offset by a lower level of legal and legal related settlement expenses million  decreased pension and postretirement expenses million  and lower consulting fees million 
other operating income for included the receipt of a million contingent payment associated with a divestiture and million for a portion of a gain realized on an intangible asset sale in chlor alkali products  which is recognized ratably through other operating income for included a million insurance recovery for hurricane katrina business interruption experienced in and in early in our chlor alkali products operations and a gain of million on the disposition of a former manufacturing plant 
the earnings of non consolidated affiliates were million for  an increase of million from  primarily due to slightly improved shipment volumes  decreased manufacturing costs  and lower depreciation expense at sunbelt  which was substantially offset by lower ecu prices at sunbelt 
interest expense increased by million  or  in  due to a higher level of outstanding debt 
interest income for was flat with as higher short term interest rates were offset by lower average cash and short term investment balances 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations for of was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of the domestic manufacturing deduction contained in the jobs creation act of  which increased from to in  and the utilization of certain state tax credits  which were offset in part by state income taxes and income in certain foreign jurisdictions being taxed at higher rates 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations for included a million reduction in income tax expense associated with the settlement of certain audit issues related to the audits for the years to  principally the tax treatment of capital losses generated in and other tax matters 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations for of  which was reduced by this tax settlement  was higher than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and income in certain foreign jurisdictions being taxed at higher rates offset in part by the domestic manufacturing deduction and utilization of certain state tax credits 
income from discontinued operations  net for was million compared with million for  an increase of million 
income from discontinued operations before income taxes for was million higher than the metals pretax income for included a last in  first out lifo inventory liquidation gain of million as part of a metals inventory reduction program initiated in the metals pretax income for included a lifo inventory liquidation gain of million related to the closure of two of our former metals facilities  partially offset by restructuring charges of million related to the closure of these metals facilities 
the metals improved results also reflect higher selling prices and lower costs resulting from the restructuring and plant shutdown actions 
these factors more than offset the negative impact of lower sales volumes and higher energy and metal melting loss costs 
the effective tax rates were for compared with last year 
the effective tax rate was lower than due to the timing of income from certain foreign jurisdictions being taxed at lower rates 
loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net for was million 
we recognized a pretax loss of million offset by a million income tax benefit 
segment results we define segment results as income loss from continuing operations before interest expense  interest income  other expense income  and income taxes and include the results of non consolidated affiliates 
consistent with the guidance in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  sfas no 
 we have determined it is appropriate to include the operating results of non consolidated affiliates in the relevant segment financial results 
our management considers sunbelt to be an integral component of the chlor alkali products segment

the earnings from non consolidated affiliates were million  million  and million for the years ended   and  respectively 
the service cost and the amortization of prior service cost components of pension expense related to the employees of the operating segments are allocated to the operating segments based on their respective estimated census data 
all other components of pension costs are included in corporate other and include items such as the expected return on plan assets  interest cost and recognized actuarial gains and losses 
the curtailment charges of million were associated with the transition of a portion of our east alton  il winchester hourly workforce and our mcintosh  al chlor alkali hourly workforce from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution pension plan 
the curtailment charge included million related to the sale of the metals business which was included in the loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
also included in the pension curtailment is million resulting from the conversion of a portion of the metals hourly workforce from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution pension plan  which was included in income from discontinued operations 
the curtailment charge of million  included in corporate other  and million  included in income from discontinued operations  for winchester and metals  respectively  represented the accelerated recognition of prior service costs 
other expense income in included an impairment charge of the full value of a million investment in corporate debt securities 
we are currently unable to utilize the capital loss resulting from the impairment of these corporate debt securities  therefore  no tax benefit was recognized during for the impairment loss 
chlor alkali products compared chlor alkali products sales for were  million compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
pioneer sales for were million compared to million for the last four months of  an increase of million 
chlor alkali products sales  excluding pioneer  increased million  or 
the sales increase was due to increased ecu pricing  partially offset by lower volumes 
the combined olin and pioneer chlorine and caustic soda ecu netback  excluding sunbelt  increased to approximately for compared to approximately in  which included pioneer for the last four months 
freight costs included in the ecu netback increased in compared to the combined olin and pioneer operating rate for was  compared to the operating rate of in the lower operating rate for resulted from lower chlorine demand and was also negatively affected by two hurricanes  which caused production and customer outages and disruptions to the transportation system 
chlor alkali posted segment income of million for compared to million for chlor alkali segment income included pioneer income of million and million for and  respectively 
chlor alkali segment income  excluding pioneer  was higher in by million  or  primarily because of increased selling prices million  partially offset by decreased volumes million  higher operating costs million  and lower sunbelt results million 
chlor alkali segment income for also included a million gain from a litigation recovery 
operating expenses increased primarily due to increases in distribution costs and manufacturing costs  which included higher electricity prices 
the lower sunbelt earnings primarily resulted from lower volumes due to the impact of hurricane related outages and other force majeure events at one of its chlorine customers partially offset by higher ecu selling prices in the operating results from sunbelt included interest expense of million and million in and  respectively  on the sunbelt notes 
compared to chlor alkali products sales for were million compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
the acquisition of pioneer contributed sales of million 
chlor alkali products sales  excluding pioneer  decreased million  or 
the sales decrease was primarily due to lower ecu pricing  which decreased from  and lower volumes  partially offset by sales increases in our value added potassium hydroxide and bleach products 
our ecu netbacks  excluding pioneer and sunbelt  were approximately for compared to approximately for  a decrease of 
escalating freight costs were a major challenge facing our chlor alkali products business in the freight cost penalty included in the ecu netback of was per ecu  compared to per ecu for  or an increase of 
for the last four months of  pioneer ecu netbacks were our combined system weighted average ecu netbacks were for pioneer ecu netbacks were higher than our average netbacks reflecting the higher level of chlorine shipped by pipeline and the higher ecu netback realized by pioneer s west coast operations 
the freight cost included in the pioneer ecu netback was comparable to our legacy chlor alkali system 
our operating rates for were of capacity  compared to in chlor alkali products posted segment income of million for which included million of pioneer income  compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
chlor alkali segment income  excluding pioneer  was lower in by million  or 
segment income was lower in because of lower selling prices million  higher operating costs million  and lower volumes million 
operating expenses increased primarily due to increases in distribution costs and manufacturing costs which includes electricity expenses 
the earnings of non consolidated affiliates  which were included in chlor alkali segment income  were million for  an increase of million from this increase was primarily due to slightly improved shipment volumes and decreased manufacturing costs at sunbelt due to lower depreciation expense which was substantially offset by lower ecu prices at sunbelt 
the operating results from sunbelt included interest expense of million and million in and  respectively  on the sunbelt notes 
winchester compared to sales were million in compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
sales of ammunition to domestic and international commercial customers increased million 
shipments to law enforcement agencies increased million for compared to shipments to military customers increased million 
winchester reported segment income of million for compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
the increase was due to the impact of higher selling prices and increased volumes to law enforcement agencies million  which were partially offset by increased commodity and other material costs and higher operating costs million and lower volumes primarily with commercial customers million 
for  the actual copper cost for winchester increased by compared to  while the average price of lead increased compared to the prior year 
the winchester business consumes approximately four times as much lead as it does copper  and the year over year increase in the actual lead cost equates to approximately million of annual expense 
compared to sales were million in compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
sales of ammunition to domestic and international commercial customers increased million primarily due to higher selling prices 
shipments to military and law enforcement organizations also increased by million and million  respectively  in sales to industrial customers increased from levels returning to sales levels 
overall  loaded ammunition unit volumes increased by in compared to winchester reported segment income of million for compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
higher selling prices and the benefits from increased sales volumes million were partially offset by increased commodity and material costs and higher operating costs million 
corporate other compared to for  pension income included in corporate other was million compared to pension expense of million for the million decrease in corporate pension expense was due to the combination of a basis point increase in the liability discount rate in  the million voluntary contribution made to our defined benefit pension plan in may  the favorable performance on plan assets in  the benefits of the plan freeze for salary and non bargained hourly employees  which became effective january   and the increase in the amortization period of actuarial losses 
these decreases were partially offset by curtailment charges of million associated with the transition of a portion of our east alton  il winchester hourly workforce and our mcintosh  al chlor alkali hourly workforce from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution pension plan 
on a total company basis  defined benefit pension income for was million compared to defined benefit pension expense of million for the decrease in total company pension expense reflected curtailment charges of million for relating to the metals business and million for the metals allocated portion of service cost and the amortization of prior service cost components of pension expense  which were included in discontinued operations 
this defined benefit pension cost reduction was partially offset by higher defined contribution pension costs 
total company defined contribution pension expense for was million compared to million for charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were million for  compared with million in this provision related primarily to expected future investigatory and remedial activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
the decrease of million was primarily due to a million charge in the prior year related to costs at a former waste disposal site based on revised remediation estimates resulting from negotiations with a government agency 
for  other corporate and unallocated costs were million compared with million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was primarily due to lower asset retirement obligation charges of million  primarily related to a reduction in the liability for a former chemical manufacturing location  lower legal and legal related settlement expenses of million  and lower consulting charges of million  partially offset by increased management incentive compensation costs of million  primarily resulting from mark to market adjustments on stock based compensation 
compared to for  pension expense included in corporate other was million compared to million in the million decrease in corporate pension expense was due to the combination of a basis point increase in discount rate  the voluntary contributions to our defined benefit pension plan of million in may and million in september  and the favorable performance on plan assets in on a total company basis  pension expense for was million compared to million in pension expense on a total company basis for included a curtailment charge of million resulting from the sale of the metals business which was included in the loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
also during  we recorded a curtailment charge of million resulting from the conversion of a portion of the metals hourly workforce from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution pension plan 
this curtailment charge was included in income from discontinued operations 
charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were million for  compared to million in  which included recoveries from third parties of environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods of million 
these charges related primarily to expected future remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
the increase in charges compared to related primarily to a million increase in costs at a former waste disposal site based on revised remediation estimates resulting from negotiations with a government agency and a million increase in costs associated with a former manufacturing operation 
for  other corporate and unallocated costs were million compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
legal and legal related settlement expenses decreased by million and consulting fees were lower by million 
these decreases were partially offset by increased asset retirement obligation charges of million  primarily based on a higher probability of an earlier retirement of certain assets 
outlook income from continuing operations in the first quarter of is projected to be in the to per diluted share range compared with per diluted share in the first quarter of in chlor alkali products  we have seen a continuation of the weak chlor alkali demand environment experienced in the fourth quarter of into the first quarter of our visibility into total first quarter chlor alkali demand is significantly less than we normally experience 
while we have seen improvements in caustic soda pricing for eight consecutive quarters  we have continued to experience weaker chlorine prices 
we expect ecu pricing in the first quarter of to improve from the fourth quarter of  but less than the increase in ecu pricing experienced sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter our january chlor alkali products operating rate was compared to a fourth quarter operating rate of 
as a result of customer demand  our st 
gabriel  la facility  which was shutdown for scheduled maintenance in late november  will not resume operations until the current conversion and expansion project is completed  which is expected in the second quarter of the st 
gabriel  la facility represents approximately of our chlorine and caustic soda capacity 
also  in the first quarter of  our mcintosh  al facility  including the sunbelt facility  has a scheduled ten day maintenance outage 
winchester first quarter results are expected to be similar to the first quarter of as improved pricing and volumes are offset by higher commodity costs 
we anticipate that charges for environmental investigatory and remedial activities will be similar to the level 
in  we expect defined benefit pension plan income to increase from the level 
the increase is primarily the result of the absence of the million curtailment charges  which were included in  but also reflects the combination of the unfavorable returns on plan assets experienced in  offset by the favorable impact of the plan curtailments 
we believe the effective tax rate will be in the to range 
in light of the current economic environment  we continue to evaluate our capital spending 
our capital spending in was approximately million lower than the million to million projected in the third quarter of this has increased the amount of carryover spending associated with both the st 
gabriel  la conversion and expansion project and a major maintenance project at our mcintosh  al facility 
based on these factors  we anticipate capital spending to be no lower than million 
as a result of the high level of capital spending  we expect depreciation expense to increase by approximately million from to approximately million 
environmental matters in millions cash outlays remedial and investigatory spending charged to reserve recoveries from third parties capital spending plant operations charged to cost of goods sold total cash outlays reserve for environmental liabilities beginning balance charges to income remedial and investigatory spending pioneer acquired liabilities currency translation adjustments ending balance total environmental related cash outlays in increased compared to and due to the spending associated with plant operations at the acquired pioneer locations 
remedial and investigatory spending was lower in than and due to an expansive investigation at a former manufacturing site and the implementation of remedial actions at five other sites in and total environmental related cash outlays for are estimated to be approximately million  of which million is expected to be spent on investigatory and remedial efforts  million on capital projects and million on normal plant operations 
historically  we have funded our environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expect to do so in the future 
cash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior years 
cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income 
in the united states  the establishment and implementation of federal  state  and local standards to regulate air  water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations 
federal legislation providing for regulation of the manufacture  transportation  use  and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances  and remediation of contaminated sites  has imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry  particularly the chemicals industry 
in addition  implementation of environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act and the clean air act  has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase plant operating costs 
our canadian facility is governed by federal environmental laws administered by environment canada and by provincial environmental laws enforced by administrative agencies 
many of these laws are comparable to the us laws described above 
we employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites 
we are party to various governmental and private environmental actions associated with past manufacturing facilities and former waste disposal sites 
associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
our ability to estimate future costs depends on whether our investigatory and remedial activities are in preliminary or advanced stages 
with respect to unasserted claims  we accrue liabilities for costs that  in our experience  we may incur to protect our interests against those unasserted claims 
our accrued liabilities for unasserted claims amounted to million at december  with respect to asserted claims  we accrue liabilities based on remedial investigation  feasibility study  remedial action and operation  maintenance and monitoring om m expenses that  in our experience  we may incur in connection with the asserted claims 
required site om m expenses are estimated and accrued in their entirety for required periods not exceeding years  which reasonably approximates the typical duration of long term site om m 
charges or credits to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were material to operating results in   and and may be material to net income in future years 
environmental provisions charged to income were as follows in millions charges to income recoveries from third parties of costs incurred and expensed in prior periods total provision these charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
in conjunction with the acquisition of pioneer  we assumed their environmental liabilities  which were attributable to nine sites 
our total estimated environmental liability at the end of  including the pioneer sites  was attributable to sites  of which were usepa national priority list npl sites 
nine sites accounted for of such liability and  of the remaining sites  no one site accounted for more than of our environmental liability 
at one of these nine sites a remedial action plan is being implemented 
at five of the nine sites  part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation and another part is in the long term om m stage 
at one of these nine sites  part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation  part to a remedial action plan  and another part is in the long term om m stage 
at one site  part of the site is subject to a remedial action plan and part of the site to long term om m 
the one remaining site is in long term om m 
all nine sites are either associated with past manufacturing operations or former waste disposal sites 
none of the nine largest sites represents more than of the liabilities reserved on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for future environmental expenditures 
our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to million at december   and million at december   of which million and million  respectively  were classified as other noncurrent liabilities 
as part of the acquisition of pioneer  we assumed million of environmental liabilities associated with their current and past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
our environmental liability amounts did not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology 
these liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
of the million included on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for future environmental expenditures  we currently expect to utilize million of the reserve for future environmental expenditures over the next years  million for expenditures to years in the future  and million for expenditures beyond years in the future 
these estimates are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  as described in item a 
risk factors environmental costs 
annual environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects  and normal plant operations are expected to range between million to million over the next several years  million to million of which is for investigatory and remedial efforts  which are expected to be charged against reserves recorded on our balance sheet 
while we do not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of our environmental related cash outlays  there is always the possibility that such an increase may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  changes in regulatory authorities  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other prps  and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
at december   we estimate we may have additional contingent environmental liabilities of million in addition to the amounts for which we have already recorded as a reserve 
legal matters and contingencies we  and our subsidiaries  are defendants in various legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos incidental to our past and current business activities 
we describe some of these matters in item legal proceedings 
while we believe that none of these legal actions will materially adversely affect our financial position  in light of the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot at this time determine whether the financial impact  if any  of these matters will be material to our results of operations 
during the ordinary course of our business  contingencies arise resulting from an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving an uncertainty as to the realization of a possible gain contingency 
in certain instances such as environmental projects  we are responsible for managing the cleanup and remediation of an environmental site 
there exists the possibility of recovering a portion of these costs from other parties 
we account for gain contingencies in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas no 
 and therefore do not record gain contingencies and recognize income until it is earned and realizable

in  working capital increased million compared with a decrease of million in receivables increased from december  by million  as a result of increased selling prices in both our chlor alkali and winchester businesses and improved volumes at winchester partially offset by lower december chlorine and caustic soda volumes compared with our days sales outstanding decreased by approximately two days from prior year 
inventories increased from december  by million primarily due to increased ammunition inventories and higher raw material costs in winchester 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased from december  by million  primarily as a result of payments of retained metals liabilities 
the cash from operations was also affected by a million increase in cash tax payments 
for  cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased million from primarily due to the effect of lower cash tax payments 
the cash provided by continuing operations was affected by a million decrease in cash tax payments 
working capital decreased million in compared to a decrease of million in partially offsetting the decrease in working capital was lower income from continuing operations 
in  cash provided by operating activities included contributions to our pension plans of million  compared to an million payment in in  cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations increased by million from primarily due to a decrease in working capital and improved income from discontinued operations 
in  metals working capital decreased by million compared with an increase of million in metals payables increased from december  by million  primarily due to timing of payments 
receivables increased from december  by million  primarily as a result of increased sales 
cash flow generated from an inventory decrease from december  of million was primarily a result of the metals inventory reduction program 
capital expenditures capital spending was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to spending of million for the st 
gabriel  la facility conversion and expansion project and increased spending for a major maintenance capital project at our mcintosh  al facility 
capital spending in included million for the st 
gabriel  la facility conversion and expansion project and also spending required to increase bleach capacity in our chlor alkali products operations 
capital spending was   and of depreciation in   and  respectively 
in  we expect our capital spending to be no less than million 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a sale leaseback transaction for chlorine railcars that were acquired in and this transaction reduced our fixed assets by approximately million 
investing activities on august   we acquired pioneer and paid cash of million 
we also acquired cash of million with the pioneer acquisition 
on november   we completed the sale of the metals business to global 
we anticipated net proceeds from the sale of million 
during  we sold million of short term investments in corporate debt securities  which were purchased during on january   we entered into a sale leaseback agreement for chlorine railcars in our chlor alkali products segment that were acquired in and we received proceeds from the sale of million 
the   and distributions from affiliated companies  net  represented primarily our share of the sunbelt joint venture s improved operating results  net of cash payments to the affiliates 
also  included in was our purchase for cash of million for an equity interest in a limited liability company that owns a bleach and related chlor alkali products manufacturing facility 
financing activities in october  million of variable rate mississippi industrial revenue bonds  which were issued in in conjunction with our relocation of a portion of our winchester operations to oxford  ms  were redeemed by us at par value 
in march  we repaid industrial development and environmental improvement tax exempt bonds  which matured totaling million that were issued through the parish of calcasieu  la and the town of mcintosh  al 
in january  we repaid the remaining million of the convertible senior subordinated notes due acquired from pioneer 
during  million of the convertible notes issued by pioneer and the related million premium were repaid using drawings from our accounts receivable facility and cash 
in july  we issued million of notes and paid a premium of million to the existing note holders in exchange for million of notes 
during  and  we issued   and  shares of common stock  respectively  with a total value of million  million and million  respectively  to the olin ceop 
these shares were issued to satisfy the investment in our common stock resulting from employee contributions  our matching contributions  retirement contributions and re invested dividends 
the percent of total debt to total capitalization decreased to at december   from at year end and at year end the decrease from was due primarily to a lower level of outstanding debt resulting from repayments and the higher shareholders equity resulting from net income offset by the non cash charge for our pension and other postretirement plans 
the decrease from year end was due primarily to the higher shareholders equity resulting from the non cash credit for our pension and other postretirement plans 
dividends per common share were in  and total dividends paid on common stock amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the payment of cash dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be determined in light of then current conditions  including our earnings  our operations  our financial conditions  our capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
in the future  our board of directors may change our dividend policy  including the frequency or amount of any dividend  in light of then existing conditions 
liquidity and other financing arrangements our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and short term borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility and borrowings under our accounts receivable facility 
historically  we also have had access to the debt and equity markets 
cash flow from operations is variable as a result of the cyclical nature of our operating results  which have been affected by economic cycles in many of the industries we serve  such as the vinyls  urethanes  and pulp and paper sectors 
cash flow from operations is affected by changes in ecu selling prices caused by the changes in the supply demand balance of chlorine and caustic  resulting in the chlor alkali business having significant leverage on our earnings 
for example  assuming all other costs remain constant and internal consumption remains approximately the same  a per ecu selling price change equates to an approximate million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit when we are operating at full capacity 
since  we held corporate debt securities with a par value of million 
on october   the issuer of these debt securities announced it would cease trading and appoint a receiver as a result of financial market turmoil 
the decline in the market value of the assets supporting these debt securities negatively impacted the liquidity of the issuer 
we determined that these debt securities had no fair market value due to the actions taken by the issuer  turmoil in the financial markets  the lack of liquidity of the issuer  and the lack of trading in these debt securities 
because of the unlikelihood that these debt securities will recover in value  we recorded an after tax impairment loss of million in other expense income during the third quarter of we are currently unable to utilize the capital loss resulting from the impairment of these corporate debt securities  therefore  no tax benefit was recognized in for the impairment loss 
in august  we entered into a million letter of credit facility to assume the various pioneer letters of credit issued principally to support the acquisition of equipment and materials for the st 
gabriel  la facility conversion and expansion project 
on october   we entered into a new five year senior revolving credit facility of million  which replaced the million senior revolving credit facility 
during the first quarter of  we increased our senior revolving credit facility by million to million by adding an additional lending institution 
the senior revolving credit facility will expire in october we have the option to expand the million senior revolving credit facility by an additional million through adding a maximum of two additional lending institutions each year 
at december   we had million available under this senior revolving credit facility  because we had issued million of letters of credit under a million subfacility 
under the senior revolving credit facility  we may select various floating rate borrowing options 
the facility includes various customary restrictive covenants  including restrictions related to the ratio of debt to earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization leverage ratio and the ratio of earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense coverage ratio 
at december   we had letters of credit of million outstanding  of which million were issued under our million senior revolving credit facility 
these letters of credit were used to support certain long term debt  capital expenditure commitments  certain workers compensation insurance policies  and plant closure and post closure obligations 
in addition to our senior revolving credit facility  we entered into two new credit facilities in june on june   we entered into a million credit facility and a million credit facility 
these commitments were put in place to support the funding of the pioneer acquisition 
the million credit facility matured on the earlier of june   or upon an increase in the lending commitments under our existing senior revolving credit facility and the establishment of an accounts receivable securitization facility  and the million credit facility would have matured on june  in the fourth quarter of  the million credit facility expired as all conditions for early termination were met and the million credit facility was terminated as we no longer needed the credit commitment 
on july   we established a million  day accounts receivable facility  renewable annually for five years  which expires in july as a result of the sale of metals  the accounts receivable facility was reduced from million to million 
in july  the accounts receivable facility was reduced from million to million 
the million accounts receivable facility provides for the sale of our eligible trade receivables to third party conduits through a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose entity that is consolidated for financial statement purposes 
as of december   we had nothing drawn under the accounts receivable facility 
at december   we had million available under the accounts receivable facility based on eligible trade receivables 
our current debt structure is used to fund our business operations 
as of december   we had long term borrowings  including the current installment  of million of which million was at variable rates 
we have entered into interest rate swaps on million of our underlying fixed rate debt obligations whereby we agree to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
the counterparty to these agreements is citibank  na  a major financial institution 
we have designated the swap agreements as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the value of fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates for a portion of our fixed rate borrowings 
accordingly  the swap agreements have been recorded at their fair market value of million and are included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related debt 
no gain or loss has been recorded as the swaps met the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting treatment with no ineffectiveness 
in july  we received proceeds of million for the termination of a million interest rate swap that was a fair value hedge for a portion of the million notes that were part of the july debt exchange 
annual maturities of long term debt are none in and  million in  none in  million in and a total of million thereafter 
commitments from banks under our senior revolving credit facility and accounts receivable facility are additional sources of liquidity 
in january  we entered into a million fixed interest rate swap with equal and opposite terms as the million variable interest rate swaps on the notes 
the result was a deferred gain of million on the million variable interest rate swaps  which will be recognized through we have agreed to pay fixed rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us variable rates 
the counterparty to this agreement is bank of america  a major financial institution 
we have registered an undetermined amount of securities with the sec  so that  from time to time  we may issue debt securities  preferred stock and or common stock and associated warrants in the public market under that registration statement 
off balance sheet arrangements we use operating leases for certain properties  such as railroad cars  distribution  warehousing and office space  and data processing and office equipment 
virtually none of our lease agreements contain escalation clauses or step rent provisions 
future minimum rent payments under operating leases having initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year at december  are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and a total of million thereafter 
assets under capital leases are not significant 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a million sale leaseback transaction for chlorine railcars that were acquired in and on december   we entered into a long term  sulfur dioxide supply agreement with alliance specialty chemicals  inc alliance  formerly known as rfc so  inc alliance has the obligation to deliver annually  tons of sulfur dioxide 
alliance owns the sulfur dioxide plant  which is located at our charleston  tn facility and is operated by us 
the price for the sulfur dioxide is fixed over the life of the contract and  under the terms of the contract  we are obligated to make a monthly payment of million regardless of the amount of sulfur dioxide purchased 
commitments related to this agreement are million per year for through and million in this supply agreement expires in we and our partner  polyone own equally sunbelt 
oxy vinyls is required to purchase thousand tons of chlorine based on a formula related to its market price 
prior to july  polyone had an ownership interest in oxy vinyls 
we market the excess chlorine and all of the caustic soda produced 
the construction of this plant and equipment was financed by the issuance of million of guaranteed senior secured notes due sunbelt sold million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series o  and million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series g 
we refer to these notes as the sunbelt notes 
the sunbelt notes bear interest at a rate of per annum payable semiannually in arrears on each june and december we have guaranteed the series o notes  and polyone has guaranteed the series g notes  in both cases pursuant to customary guaranty agreements 
our guarantee and polyone s guarantee are several  rather than joint 
therefore  we are not required to make any payments to satisfy the series g notes guaranteed by polyone 
an insolvency or bankruptcy of polyone will not automatically trigger acceleration of the sunbelt notes or cause us to be required to make payments under our guarantee  even if polyone is required to make payments under its guarantee 
however  if sunbelt does not make timely payments on the sunbelt notes  whether as a result of a failure to pay on a guarantee or otherwise  the holders of the sunbelt notes may proceed against the assets of sunbelt for repayment 
if we were to make debt service payments under our guarantee  we would have a right to recover such payments from sunbelt 
beginning on december  and each year through  sunbelt is required to repay million of the sunbelt notes  of which million is attributable to the series o notes 
after the payment of million on the series o notes in december  our guarantee of these notes was million 
in the event sunbelt cannot make any of these payments  we would be required to fund the payment on the series o notes 
in certain other circumstances  we may also be required to repay the sunbelt notes prior to their maturity 
we and polyone have agreed that  if we or polyone intend to transfer our respective interests in sunbelt and the transferring party is unable to obtain consent from holders of of the aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness related to the guarantee being transferred after good faith negotiations  then we and polyone will be required to repay our respective portions of the sunbelt notes 
in such event  any make whole or similar penalties or costs will be paid by the transferring party 
excluding our guarantee of the sunbelt notes described above  our long term contractual commitments  including the on and off balance sheet arrangements  consisted of the following payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions debt obligations interest payments under debt obligations and interest rate swap agreements a contingent tax liability fin qualified pension plan contributions b non qualified pension plan payments postretirement benefit payments off balance sheet commitments noncancelable operating leases purchasing commitments raw materials utilities total a for the purposes of this table  we have assumed for all periods presented that there are no changes in the principal amount of any variable rate debt from the amounts outstanding on december  and that there are no changes in the rates from those in effect at december  which ranged from to 
b these amounts are only estimated payments assuming an annual expected rate of return on pension plan assets of  and a discount rate on pension plan obligations of 
these estimated payments are subject to significant variation and the actual payments may be more than the amounts estimated 
given the inherent uncertainty as to actual minimum funding requirements for qualified pension plans  no amounts are included in this table for any period beyond one year 
as a result of the asset allocation adjustment  the favorable asset performance in and  the million and million voluntary contributions  and the benefits from the plan freeze  offset by the unfavorable performance on plan assets in  based on the current funding requirements  we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic defined benefit pension plan at least through see discussion on pension protection act of amended by the worker  retiree  and employer recovery act in pension plans and retirement benefits in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
non cancelable operating leases and purchasing commitments are utilized in our normal course of business for our projected needs 
for losses that we believe are probable and which are estimable we have accrued for such amounts in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the table above  we have various commitments and contingencies including defined benefit and postretirement healthcare plans as described below  environmental matters see environmental matters included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and litigation claims see item legal proceedings 
we have several defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  as described in the pension plans and retirement benefits note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we fund the defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus such amounts we deem appropriate 
we have postretirement healthcare plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired employees and their beneficiaries  as described in the pension plans and retirement benefits note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these other postretirement plans are not pre funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred 
we also have standby letters of credit of million of which million have been issued through our senior revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million available under our senior revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements include goodwill recoverability  environmental  restructuring and other unusual items  litigation  income tax reserves including deferred tax asset valuation allowances  pension  postretirement and other benefits and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on prior experience  facts and circumstances and other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
goodwill goodwill and other intangibles are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter and or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business climate  a significant adverse legal judgment  adverse cash flow trends  an adverse action or assessment by a government agency  unanticipated competition  decline in our stock price  and a significant restructuring charge within a reporting unit 
the annual impairment test involves the comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount 
the fair value is determined based on a variety of assumptions including estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit  discount rates  and comparable company trading multiples 
based on our evaluation prepared in the fourth quarter of  no impairment charge was recorded 
all of our recorded goodwill  which is associated with acquisitions  is included in the chlor alkali products segment 
given the economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions  made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of  will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted sales or gross margins are not achieved  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
environmental accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing technologies 
these amounts  which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties  are adjusted periodically as assessments and remediation efforts progress or additional technical or legal information becomes available 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  changes in regulatory authorities  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other prps and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
pension and postretirement plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans and non pension postretirement benefit plans using actuarial models required by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pension  sfas no 
 respectively 
these models use an attribution approach that generally spreads the financial impact of changes to the plan and actuarial assumptions over the average remaining service lives of the employees in the plan 
changes in liability due to changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate  rate of compensation increases and mortality  as well as annual deviations between what was assumed and what was experienced by the plan are treated as gains or losses 
the principle underlying the required attribution approach is that employees render service over their average remaining service lives on a relatively smooth basis and  therefore  the accounting for benefits earned under the pension or non pension postretirement benefits plans should follow the same relatively smooth pattern 
with the freezing of our defined benefit pension plan for salaried and certain non bargained hourly employees that became effective january  and the sale of the metals business  substantially all defined benefit pension plan participants were inactive  therefore  actuarial gains and losses are now being amortized based upon the remaining life expectancy of the inactive plan participants rather than the future service period of the active participants  which was the amortization period used prior to at december   the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants in the defined benefit pension plan was years  compared to the average remaining service lives of the active employees in the defined benefit pension plan of years 
the increase in the amortization period of actuarial losses had the effect of increasing defined benefit pension income compared to at december   the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants in the defined benefit pension plan was years 
one of the key assumptions for the net periodic pension calculation is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  used to determine the market related value of assets 
the market related value of assets recognizes differences between the plan s actual return and expected return over a five year period 
the required use of an expected long term rate of return on the market related value of plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and  therefore  result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees 
as differences between actual and expected returns are recognized over five years  they subsequently generate gains and losses that are subject to amortization over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive plan participants  as described in the preceding paragraph 
we use long term historical actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets  and future estimates of long term investment returns by reference to external sources to develop the expected return on plan assets as of december the discount rate assumptions used for pension and non pension postretirement benefit plan accounting reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments on december of each year 
the rate of compensation increase is based upon our long term plans for such increases 
for retiree medical plan accounting  we review external data and our own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates 
changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions resulting from economic events 
for example  holding all other assumptions constant  a basis point decrease or increase in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased  respectively  the pension income by approximately million 
holding all other assumptions constant  a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to calculate pension income for and the projected benefit obligation as of december  would have decreased pension income by million and increased the projected benefit obligation by million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate used to calculate pension income for and the projected benefit obligation as of december  would have increased pension income by million and decreased the projected benefit obligation by million

new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas r  employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets  fsp fas r  an amendment of sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  sfas no 
r 
this position will require more detailed disclosures regarding defined benefit pension plan assets including investment policies and strategies  major categories of plan assets  valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
this position becomes effective for fiscal years ending after december  upon initial application  the provisions of this position are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes 
we are currently evaluating the disclosure requirements of this new position 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 an amendment to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 

the statement requires enhanced disclosures that expand the disclosure requirements in sfas no 
about an entity s derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires more robust qualitative disclosures and expanded quantitative disclosures 
this statement became effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
in  which will require additional disclosure in our financial statements 
the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  sfas no 
r 
this statement requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires additional disclosures by the acquirer 
under this statement  all business combinations will be accounted for by applying the acquisition method 
this statement became effective for us on january  and will be applied to business combinations occurring after the effective date 
earlier application was prohibited 
the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
r on our financial statements will be on adjustments made to pre acquisition pioneer income tax contingencies  which will no longer be reflected as an adjustment to goodwill but recognized through income tax expense beginning in in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  sfas no 

this statement will require noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interests to be treated as a separate component of equity  not as a liability or other item outside of permanent equity 
the statement applies to the accounting for noncontrolling interests and transactions with noncontrolling interest holders in consolidated financial statements 
this statement became effective for us on january  earlier application was prohibited 
this statement was applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests  including any that arose before the effective date except that comparative period information must be recast to classify noncontrolling interests in equity  attribute net income and other comprehensive income to noncontrolling interests  and provide additional required disclosures 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas no 
which permitted an entity to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the statement s objective was to improve financial reporting by allowing entities to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by the measurement of related assets and liabilities using different attributes  without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement became effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and was to be applied prospectively 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on january  as we did not elect to measure existing assets and liabilities at fair value  the adoption of this statement did not have an effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 

this statement did not require any new fair value measurements  but rather  it provided enhanced guidance to other pronouncements that require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of this statement related to the definition of fair value  the methods used to estimate fair value  and the requirement for expanded disclosures about estimates of fair value 
this statement became effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the effective date for this statement for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis was delayed by one year 
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that could be impacted by this deferral include assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination  and intangible assets and goodwill tested annually for impairment 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
related to financial assets and financial liabilities on january   which required additional disclosure in our financial statements 
the partial adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we adopted the remaining provisions of sfas no 
related to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on january  the adoption of the remaining provisions of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
this position clarifies the application of fasb no 
in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
this position was effective for us on september  the adoption of this position did not have an effect on our financial statements 
derivative financial instruments sfas no 
required an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
we use hedge accounting treatment for substantially all of our business transactions whose risks are covered using derivative instruments 
sfas no 
required that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
for derivatives designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of both the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
ineffective portions are recognized currently in earnings 
unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognized currently in earnings 
all derivatives recognized in earnings impact the expense line item on our consolidated statement of operations that is consistent with the nature of the underlying hedged item 
we enter into forward sales and purchase contracts to manage currency risk resulting from purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign currencies principally australian dollar and canadian dollar 
all of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for united states dollar equivalents 
at december   we had no forward contracts to buy or to sell foreign currencies 
at december   we had forward contracts to sell foreign currencies with a fair value of million and no forward contracts to buy foreign currencies 
foreign currency exchange gains  net of taxes  were million and million in and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange losses  net of taxes  were million in we use cash flow hedges for certain raw material and energy costs such as copper  zinc  lead  and natural gas to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations 
we use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest rates on our outstanding fixed rate debt obligations 
these interest rate swaps are treated as fair value hedges 
the accounting for gains and losses associated with changes in fair value of the derivative and the effect on the consolidated financial statements will depend on the hedge designation and whether the hedge is effective in offsetting changes in fair value of cash flows of the asset or liability being hedged 
losses on settled futures contracts were million  million  net of taxes and million  million  net of taxes in and  respectively  which were included in cost of goods sold 
gains on settled futures contracts were million  million  net of taxes  in  which were included in cost of goods sold 
at december   we had open positions in futures contracts through totaling million million 
if all open futures contracts had been settled on december   we would have recognized a pretax loss of million 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss included a loss  net of taxes  in fair value on commodity forward contracts of million 
if commodity prices were to remain at the levels they were at december   approximately million of deferred losses  net of tax  would be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months 
the actual effect on earnings will be dependant on commodity prices when the forecasted transactions occur 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss included a gain  net of taxes  in fair value on commodity forward contracts of million 
the fair value of our derivative asset and liability balances were december  in millions other current assets other assets total derivative asset accrued liabilities long term debt total derivative liability the ineffective portion of changes in fair value resulted in zero  million and million charged credited to earnings for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our foreign currency forward contracts and certain commodity derivatives did not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting 
the effect on operating results of items not qualifying for hedge accounting for   and was not material to earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our purchases of certain commodities  our ongoing investing and financing activities  and our operations that use foreign currencies 
the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows and future earnings 
we have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks 
energy costs including electricity used in our chlor alkali products segment  and certain raw materials and energy costs  namely copper  lead  zinc  electricity  and natural gas used primarily in our winchester segment products are subject to price volatility 
depending on market conditions  we may enter into futures contracts and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations 
as of december   we maintained open positions on futures contracts totaling million million at december  
assuming a hypothetical increase in commodity prices  which are currently hedged  we would experience an million million at december  increase in our cost of inventory purchased  which would be substantially offset by a corresponding increase in the value of related hedging instruments 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our investing and financing activities 
the effect of interest rates on investing activity is not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
our current debt structure is used to fund business operations  and commitments from banks under our senior revolving credit facility and our accounts receivable facility are sources of liquidity 
as of december   we had long term borrowings of million million at december  of which million million at december  was issued at variable rates 
as a result of our fixed rate financings  we entered into floating interest rate swaps in order to manage interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels 
we have entered into million of such swaps  whereby we agree to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
the counterparty to these agreements is citibank  na  a major financial institution 
in all cases the underlying index for the variable rates is six month london interbank offered rate libor 
accordingly  payments are settled every six months and the terms of the swaps are the same as the underlying debt instruments 
in january  we entered into a million fixed interest rate swap with equal and opposite terms as the million variable interest rate swaps on the notes 
the result was a deferred gain of million on the million variable interest rate swaps  which will be recognized through we have agreed to pay fixed rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us variable rates 
the counterparty to this agreement is bank of america  a major financial institution 
assuming no changes in the million of variable rate debt levels from december   we estimate that a hypothetical change of basis points in the libor interest rates from would impact annual interest expense by million 
the following table reflects the swap activity related to certain debt obligations as of december  underlying debt instrument swap amount date of swap december  floating rate in millions  due december  due march a industrial development and environmental improvement obligations at interest rates of to  due march march a actual rate is set in arrears 
we project the rate will fall within the range shown 
these interest rate swaps reduced interest expense by million  million and million in   and  respectively 
in july  we received proceeds of million for the termination of a million interest rate swap that was a fair value hedge for a portion of the million notes that were part of the july debt exchange 
if the actual change in interest or commodities pricing is substantially different than expected  the net impact of interest rate risk or commodity risk on our cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above 
we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
