item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and to pay existing obligations 
it is our intention to make further adjustments to this plan as necessary depending upon our liquidity  economic conditions and commodity prices 
in view of current market conditions we intend to more actively utilize joint ventures or other similar industry partnerships or participation arrangements to develop our asset base 
in  we announced the sale of of our working interests in our columbia river basin acreage  which will be jointly developed going forward  we also announced that we were seeking partners for the development of our piceance basin assets  and are continuing to pursue a transaction or transactions with the assistance of merrill lynch and jpmorgan 
we are currently engaged in other joint venture focused discussions regarding development of several of our other asset areas 
achieve consistent reserve growth through repeatable development we have experienced significant reserve growth over the past four years through a combination of acquisitions and drilling successes 
although prior to the majority of our reserve and production growth came through acquisitions  in and we achieved significant reserve and production increases as a result of our drilling program 
in  we are focused on the efficient deployment of available capital to maintain current reserves and production levels 
we anticipate that the majority of our future reserve and production growth will come through the execution of our development drilling program 
our piceance basin development drilling inventory generally consists of locations in fields that demonstrate low variance in well performance  which leads to predictable and repeatable field development 
our reserve estimates change continuously and we evaluate such reserve estimates on a quarterly basis  with an independent engineering evaluation completed on an annual basis 
deviations in the market prices of both crude oil and natural gas and the effects of acquisitions  dispositions and exploratory development activities have a significant effect on the quantities and present and future values of our reserves 
subject to capital availability as noted above  we believe our capital deployment focused in the rockies will allow us to maintain our production levels in until improved commodity prices support more aggressive drilling activity 

table of contents maintain high percentage ownership and operational control over our asset base as of december   we controlled approximately  net undeveloped acres  representing approximately of our total net acreage position 
we retain a high degree of operational control over our asset base  through a high average working interest or acting as the operator in our areas of significant activity 
this provides us with controlling interests in a multi year inventory of drilling locations  positioning us for continued reserve and production growth through our drilling operations when commodity pricing supports greater growth focused drilling activity 
this level of ownership and control also enables us to seek joint ventures or industry partnerships on the acreage 
we plan to maintain this advantage to allow us to control the timing  level and allocation of our drilling capital expenditures and the technology and methods utilized in the planning  drilling and completion process  though our ability to control these matters may be diminished by the terms of joint venture or partnership arrangements we may enter into 
we believe this flexibility to opportunistically pursue exploration and development projects relating to our properties is particularly valuable in view of the current lower commodity price and limited capital availability environment 
we also have a interest in dhs drilling company dhs  as well as a contractual right of priority access to drilling rigs owned by dhs 
acquire and maintain acreage positions in high potential resource plays although we anticipate that our exploratory drilling efforts during will be much more limited than in the past  we believe that to the extent permitted by our cash flow our ongoing development of reserves in our core areas should be supplemented with exploratory efforts that may lead to new discoveries in the future 
we continually evaluate our opportunities and pursue attractive potential opportunities that take advantage of our strengths 
we have significant undeveloped  unproved acreage positions in the columbia river basin of washington and oregon  the haynesville shale in texas  lighthouse point in louisiana and the central utah hingeline  each of which has gained substantial interest within the exploration and production sector due to their relatively unexplored nature and the potential for meaningful hydrocarbon recoveries 
there are other mid size and large independent exploration and production companies conducting drilling activities in these plays 
we are currently drilling our first operated well in the columbia river basin and expect to be at total depth in the coming months 
currently  our million capital budget has limited allocation to our other exploratory projects  including a small amount in the haynesville shale 
however  with increased commodity prices or the addition of joint venture partners to fund a portion of the development cost  our plans for could change with respect to these potentially rewarding exploratory plays 
pursue a disciplined acquisition strategy in our core areas of operation historically we have been successful at growing through targeted acquisitions 
although our multi year drilling inventory provides us with the opportunity to grow reserves and production organically without acquisitions  we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities  primarily in our core areas of operation 
in addition  we will continue to look to divest assets located in fully developed or non core areas 
maintain an active hedging program although we liquidated a significant portion of our hedges for a profit in order to reduce counterparty credit risk  from time to time we manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging meaningful portions of our expected production through the use of derivatives  typically costless collars 
the level of our hedging activity and the duration of the instruments employed depend upon our view of market conditions  available hedge prices and our operating strategy 
we use hedges to limit the risk of fluctuating cash flows used to fund our capital expenditure program 
we also typically use hedges in conjunction with acquisitions to achieve expected economic returns during the payout period 
as of march   we are unhedged with respect to our production 
however  in accordance with the terms of the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility  we expect to put derivative contracts in place to establish a commodity floor price for our anticipated production of a minimum of for the last two quarters of  for the calendar year and for the calendar year experienced management and operational team with advanced exploration and development technology our senior management team has  on average  over years of experience in the oil and gas industry  and has a proven track record of creating value both organically and through strategic acquisitions 
our management team is supported by an active board of directors with extensive experience in the oil and gas industry 
our experienced 
table of contents technical staff utilizes sophisticated geologic and d seismic models to enhance predictability and reproducibility over significantly larger areas than historically possible 
we also utilize multi zone  multi stage artificial stimulation frac technology in completing our wells to substantially increase near term production  resulting in faster payback periods and higher rates of return and present values 
our team has successfully applied these techniques in the completions of our wells in our rocky mountain natural gas fields 
operations during the year ended december   we were primarily engaged in two industry segments  namely the acquisition  exploration  development  and production of oil and natural gas properties and related business activities  and contract oil and natural gas drilling operations 
oil and gas operations the following table presents information regarding our primary oil and natural gas areas of operation as of december  proved reserves natural proved production areas of operations bcfe gas developed mmcfe d rocky mountain region gulf coast region other total bcfe means billion cubic feet of gas equivalent mmcfe d means million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day we intend to focus our capital spending on development of our core area of operation in the rocky mountains  the piceance basin  and to a lesser extent on our exploratory efforts in the columbia river basin 
for the year ending december   we currently plan to spend million on our drilling program  but may adjust this plan depending on our liquidity  economic conditions and commodity prices 
the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility limits our ability to make capital expenditures beyond this level until we have successfully reduced the amounts outstanding under our credit facility as well as other payables 
our oil and gas operations have been comprised primarily of production of oil and natural gas  drilling exploratory and development wells and related operations and acquiring and selling oil and natural gas properties 
directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries  and through amber resources company of colorado amber  our owned subsidiary  crb partners  llc crbp and pgr partners  llc pgr  we currently own producing and non producing oil and natural gas interests  undeveloped leasehold interests and related assets in states  interests in a producing federal unit offshore california and undeveloped offshore federal leases near santa barbara  california 
we intend to continue our emphasis on the drilling of exploratory and development wells  primarily in the piceance basin of colorado and the columbia river basin in washington 
we have oil and gas leases with governmental entities and other third parties who enter into oil and gas leases or assignments with us in the regular course of our business 
we have no material patents  licenses  franchises or concessions that we consider significant to our oil and gas operations 
the nature of our business is such that it is not seasonal  we do not engage in any research and development activities and we do not maintain or require a substantial amount of products  customer orders or inventory 
our oil and gas operations are not subject to renegotiations of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government 
we operate the majority of our properties and control the costs incurred 
we have never been a debtor in any bankruptcy  receivership  reorganization or similar proceeding 
contract drilling operations through a series of transactions in and  we acquired and now own an interest in dhs  an affiliated colorado corporation that is headquartered in casper  wyoming 
during the second quarter of  dhs engaged in a reorganization transaction pursuant to which it became a subsidiary of dhs holding company  a delaware corporation  and the company s ownership interest became an interest in dhs holding company 
references to dhs herein shall be deemed to include both dhs holding company and dhs  unless the context otherwise requires 

table of contents dhs is a consolidated entity of delta 
delta currently owns a interest in dhs holding company  controls the board of directors of dhs and has priority access to all of dhs s drilling rigs 
at december   dhs owned drilling rigs with depth ratings of approximately  to  feet  only three of which are currently active 
we have the right to use all of the rigs on a priority basis  although current economic conditions have resulted in an abundance of available drilling rigs in the rocky mountain area at the present time 
the following table presents our average drilling revenue per day and rigs available for service for the years ended december  and years ended december  average number of rigs owned during period total rig days available average drilling revenue per day total rig days available includes the number of days each rig was either under contract or available for contract 
in view of the current abundance of drilling rig capacity  we would expect drilling day rates to be substantially lower in  assuming industry conditions remain in their current state 
dhs also owns of chapman trucking  which was acquired in november employing its trucks and trailers  chapman provides moving services for dhs and for third party drilling rigs 
chapman trucking continues to market trucking services in the casper  wyoming area 
contracts drilling we earn our dhs contract drilling revenues under day work or turnkey contracts which vary depending upon the rig employed  equipment and services supplied  geographic location  term of the contract  competitive conditions and other variables 
our contracts generally provide for a basic day rate during drilling operations  with lower rates or no payment for periods of equipment breakdown 
when a rig is mobilized or demobilized from an operating area  a contract may provide for different day rates during the mobilization or demobilization 
turnkey contracts are accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
contracts to employ our drilling rigs have a term based on a specified period of time or the time required to drill a specified well or number of wells 
the contract term in some instances may be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional term  or by exercising a right of first refusal 
most contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract at the customer s option without paying a termination fee 
markets the principal products produced by us are crude oil and natural gas 
the products are generally sold at the wellhead to purchasers in the immediate area where the product is produced 
the principal markets for oil and natural gas are refineries and transmission companies which have facilities near our producing properties 
dhs s principal market is the drilling of oil and natural gas wells for us and others in the rocky mountain and onshore gulf coast regions 
to the extent that dhs rigs are not fully utilized by us  dhs typically contracts with other oil and gas companies on a single well basis  with optional extensions 
distribution oil and natural gas produced from our wells are normally sold to various purchasers as discussed below 
oil is picked up and transported by the purchaser from the wellhead 
in some instances we are charged a fee for the cost of transporting the oil which is deducted from or accounted for in the price paid for the oil 
natural gas wells are connected to pipelines generally owned by the natural gas purchasers 
a variety of pipeline transportation charges are usually included in the calculation of the price paid for the natural gas 

table of contents competition we encounter strong competition from major oil companies and independent operators in acquiring properties and leases for the exploration for  and the development and production of  natural gas and crude oil 
competition is particularly intense with respect to the acquisition of desirable undeveloped oil and gas leases 
the principal competitive factors in the acquisition of undeveloped oil and gas leases include the availability and quality of staff and data necessary to identify  investigate and purchase such leases  and the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop such leases 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources  and more fully developed staffs and facilities than ours 
in addition  the producing  processing and marketing of natural gas and crude oil are affected by a number of factors which are beyond our control  the effect of which cannot be accurately predicted 
see item a 
risk factors 
to the extent that the dhs drilling rigs are not fully utilized by us for any reason  dhs is permitted to drill wells for our competitors in the oil and gas business in order to achieve revenues to sustain its operations 
to a large degree  the success of dhs s business is dependent upon the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  development and production activities 
recent decreases in the price of natural gas and oil have had a material adverse impact on exploration  development  and production activities by all of dhs s customers  including us  which will materially affect its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
raw materials the principal raw materials and resources necessary for the exploration and development of natural gas and crude oil are leasehold prospects under which natural gas and oil reserves may be discovered  drilling rigs and related equipment to drill for and produce such reserves and knowledgeable personnel to conduct all phases of gas and oil operations 
recent decreases in demand for oil and gas have resulted in equipment and supplies used in our business being available from multiple sources 
major customers during the year ended december   we had two companies that individually accounted for and of our total oil and gas sales 
although a substantial portion of production is purchased by these major customers  we do not believe the loss of any one or several customers would have a material adverse effect on our business as other customers or markets would be accessible to us 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
during  dhs had one major customer other than delta 
our projected reduction in drilling activities and the loss of other customers will have a material adverse effect on dhs if there is a sustained period of lower prices of natural gas and oil as discussed above 
government regulation of the oil and gas industry general our business is affected by numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations  including those relating to protection of the environment  public health  and worker safety 
the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly expensive  complex  and stringent 
non compliance with these laws and regulations may result in imposition of substantial liabilities  including civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  certain laws impose strict liability for environmental remediation and other costs 
changes in any of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in light of the many uncertainties with respect to future laws and regulations  we cannot predict the overall effect of such laws and regulations on our future operations 
nevertheless  the trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and controls on activities that may affect the environment  and future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation may be substantially more than we expect 
we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations and that the existence and enforcement of such laws and regulations have no more restrictive effect on our method of operations 
table of contents than on other similar companies in the energy industry 
accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business  and the costs of preventing and responding to such releases are embedded in the normal costs of doing business 
in addition to the costs of environmental protection associated with our ongoing operations  we may incur unforeseen investigation and remediation expenses at facilities we formerly owned and operated or at third party owned waste disposal sites that we have used 
such expenses are difficult to predict and may arise at sites operated in compliance with past industry standards and procedures 
the following discussion contains summaries of certain laws and regulations and is qualified in its entirety by the foregoing 
environmental regulation our operations are subject to numerous federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations concerning our oil and gas operations  products and other activities 
in particular  these laws and regulations govern  among other things  the issuance of permits associated with exploration  drilling and production activities  the types of activities that may be conducted in environmentally protected areas such as wetlands and wildlife habitats  the release of emissions into the atmosphere  the discharge and disposal of regulated substances and waste materials  offshore oil and gas operations  the reclamation and abandonment of well and facility sites  and the remediation of contaminated sites 
governmental approvals and permits are currently  and will likely in the future be  required in connection with our operations  and in the construction and operation of gathering systems  storage facilities  pipelines and transportation facilities midstream operations 
the success of obtaining  and the duration of  such approvals are contingent upon a significant number of variables  many of which are not within our control  or those of others involved in midstream operations 
to the extent such approvals are required and not granted  operations may be delayed or curtailed  or we may be prohibited from proceeding with planned exploration or operation of facilities 
environmental laws and regulations are expected to have an increasing impact on our operations  although it is impossible to predict accurately the effect of future developments in such laws and regulations on our future earnings and operations 
some risk of environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in our operations and products  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred  however  we do not currently expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with such laws and regulations 
although future environmental obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition  there can be no assurance that future developments  such as increasingly stringent environmental laws or enforcement thereof  will not cause us to incur substantial environmental liabilities or costs 
because we are engaged in acquiring  operating  exploring for and developing natural resources  in addition to federal laws we are subject to various state and local provisions regarding environmental and ecological matters 
compliance with environmental laws may necessitate significant capital outlays  may materially affect our earnings potential  and could cause material changes in our proposed business 
in the past these laws have not had a material adverse effect on our business 
however  during  the colorado oil and gas conservation commission cogcc promulgated new regulations related to oil and gas development which are intended to prevent or mitigate environmental impacts of oil and gas development and include the permitting of wells 
it should be noted in that regard that we conduct a significant portion of our business in colorado and have the majority of our drilling capital budgeted there for although we do not anticipate that expenditures to comply with existing environmental laws in any of the areas that we operate will change materially during  we cannot be certain as to the nature and impact any new statutes implemented in colorado or in other states in which we conduct our business may have on our operations 
hazardous substances and waste disposal we currently own or lease interests in numerous properties that have been used for many years for natural gas and crude oil production 
although the operator of such properties may have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or 
table of contents under the properties owned or leased by us 
in addition  some disposal sites that we have used have been operated by third parties over whom we had no control 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and comparable state statutes impose strict joint and several liability on current and former owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites 
the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes govern the management and disposal of wastes 
although cercla currently excludes petroleum from cleanup liability  many state laws affecting our operations impose clean up liability regarding petroleum and petroleum related products 
in addition  although rcra currently classifies certain exploration and production wastes as non hazardous  such wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes  thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements 
if such a change were to occur  it could have a significant impact on our operating costs  as well as on the oil and gas industry in general 
oil spills the federal clean water act cwa and the federal oil pollution act of  as amended opa  impose significant penalties and other liabilities with respect to oil spills that damage or threaten navigable waters of the united states 
under the opa  i owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines  ii lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located  and iii owners and operators of tank vessels responsible parties are strictly liable on a joint and several basis for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into the navigable waters of the united states 
these damages include  for example  natural resource damages  real and personal property damages and economic losses 
opa limits the strict liability of responsible parties for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil to million in the case of onshore facilities  million plus removal costs in the case of offshore facilities  and in the case of tank vessels  an amount based on gross tonnage of the vessel  however  these limits do not apply if the discharge was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct  or by the violation of an applicable federal safety  construction or operating regulation by the responsible party  its agent or subcontractor or in certain other circumstances 
to date  we have not had any such material spills 
in addition  with respect to certain offshore facilities  opa requires evidence of financial responsibility in an amount of up to million 
tank vessels must provide such evidence in an amount based on the gross tonnage of the vessel 
failure to comply with these requirements or failure to cooperate during a spill event may subject a responsible party to civil or criminal enforcement actions and penalties 
under our various agreements  we have primary liability for oil spills that occur on properties for which we act as operator 
with respect to properties for which we do not act as operator  we are generally liable for oil spills to the extent of our interest as a non operating working interest owner 
offshore production offshore oil and gas operations in us waters are subject to regulations of the united states department of the interior  mineral management service mms  which currently impose strict liability upon the lessee under a federal lease for the cost of clean up of pollution resulting from the lessee s operations 
as a result  such a lessee could be subject to possible liability for pollution damages 
in the event of a serious incident of pollution  the department of the interior may require a lessee under federal leases to suspend or cease operations in the affected areas 
we do not act as operator for any of our offshore california properties 
the operators of our offshore california properties are primarily liable for oil spills and are required by mms to carry certain types of insurance and to post bonds in that regard 
there is no assurance that applicable insurance coverage is adequate to protect us 
abandonment obligations we are responsible for costs associated with the plugging of wells  the removal of facilities and equipment and site restoration on our oil and natural gas properties according to our pro rata ownership 
we follow the accounting 
table of contents required by the statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas requires entities to record the fair value of liabilities for retirement obligations of acquired assets 
we had a discounted asset retirement obligation of approximately million at december  estimates of abandonment costs and their timing may change due to many factors  including actual drilling and production results  inflation rates and changes to environmental laws and regulations 
estimated asset retirement obligations are added to net unamortized historical oil and gas property costs for purposes of computing depreciation  depletion and amortization expense charges 
employees at december  we had approximately full time employees 
additionally  certain operators  engineers  geologists  geophysicists  landmen  pumpers  draftsmen  title attorneys and others necessary for our operations are retained on a contract or fee basis as their services are required 
item a 
risk factors 
an investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully read and consider the risks described below before deciding to invest in our securities 
the occurrence of any such risks may materially harm our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in any such case  the trading price of our common stock and other securities could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
when determining whether to invest in our securities  you should also refer to the other information contained in this annual report on form k  including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  and in our subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission 
risks related to our business and industries 
the terms of our forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility require us to raise significant capital and take other actions to repay indebtedness and a portion of our existing payables in the near future 
the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility includes provisions that will require us to raise at least million through capital raising transactions  including potentially asset sales  joint ventures or other similar industry partnerships in the next to days in order to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility and to pay amounts currently due to suppliers and other third party contractors 
in connection with the redetermination of our borrowing base  and our current accounts payable situation  our auditors have issued an audit report on our financial statements which contains a going concern explanatory paragraph which may be perceived adversely in our effort to attract capital 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully raise the amount of capital required to meet our obligations under the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility 
if we fail to do so  the lenders under our credit facility will be entitled to accelerate the amounts due thereunder and take other actions to collect such amounts 
any such acceleration would result in a cross acceleration of amounts due under the indentures for our senior notes and our convertible notes 
inadequate liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business operations in the future 
our efforts to improve our liquidity position will be very challenging given the current economic climate 
current economic fundamentals portray a dismal outlook for the oil and natural gas exploration and development business for at least a significant portion of due to extremely low and volatile oil and natural gas prices coupled with a global recession that is projected to be the longest and most severe in the post war period 
these economic conditions have resulted in a decline in our revenues and available capital  and have caused us to significantly decrease our drilling activities and operations 
moreover  the full effect of many of the actions that we have taken to improve our liquidity will not be realized until later in  even if they are successfully implemented 
our ability to maintain adequate liquidity through will depend significantly on our ability to raise capital  commodity prices increases  adequate pipeline capacity  completion of some of our potential asset sales and joint venture efforts  curtailment of operating expenses and capital spending  generation of additional working capital and the availability of funding 
we are committed to exploring all of these options because there is no assurance that industry or capital markets conditions will improve in the near term 
even if we implement the planned capital raising transactions and the operating actions that are substantially within our control  our estimated liquidity during the first half of will be at or near the minimum amount necessary to operate our business and to satisfy the requirements of the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility 

table of contents natural gas and oil prices are volatile 
declining prices have adversely affected our financial position  financial results  cash flows  access to capital and ability to grow 
our revenues  operating results  profitability and future rate of growth depend primarily upon the prices we receive for the natural gas and oil we sell 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow from banks is subject to periodic redeterminations based on prices specified by our bank group at the time of redetermination 
in addition  we may have asset carrying value write downs if prices fall  as has been the case in the past three months 
historically  the markets for natural gas and oil have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
wide fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil  market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control  including worldwide and domestic supplies of natural gas and oil  weather conditions  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities  the price and level of foreign imports  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  the ability of members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  and overall domestic and global economic conditions 
these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future natural gas and oil price movements with any certainty 
declines in natural gas and oil prices not only reduce revenue  but also reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically and  as a result  have had  and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and reserves 
further  natural gas and oil prices do not necessarily move in tandem 
because approximately of our reserves at december  were natural gas reserves  we are more affected by movements in natural gas prices 
further reduction of our credit ratings  or failure to restore our credit ratings to higher levels  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our credit ratings have been downgraded to historically low levels 
our unsecured debt is currently assigned a non investment grade rating by each of the four nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
the decline in our credit ratings reflects the agencies concerns over our financial strength 
our current credit ratings reduce our access to the unsecured debt markets and will unfavorably impact our overall cost of borrowing 
further downgrades of our current credit ratings or significant worsening of our financial condition could also result in increased demands by our suppliers for accelerated payment terms or other more onerous supply terms 

table of contents our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness and to third parties generally 
as of december   our total outstanding long term liabilities were million  including million of outstanding borrowings drawn under our credit facility which are classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
our long term indebtedness represented of our total book capitalization at december  as of december   we had no additional availability under our credit facility 
our borrowing base will be reduced upon the successful completion of our capital raising efforts to million  which will require repayments of at least million in accordance with the terms of the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility entered into subsequent to year end 
our senior unsecured notes indenture currently limits our incurrence of additional secured borrowings 
our degree of leverage could have important consequences  including the following it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital  capital expenditures  further exploration  debt service requirements  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  including our operations  capital expenditures and future business opportunities  the debt service requirements of other indebtedness in the future could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  certain of our borrowings  including borrowings under our credit facility  are at variable rates of interest  exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates  as we have pledged most of our oil and natural gas properties and the related equipment  inventory  accounts and proceeds as collateral for the borrowings under our credit facility  they may not be pledged as collateral for other borrowings and would be at risk in the event of a default thereunder  it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  we are vulnerable in the present downturn in general economic conditions and in our business  and we will likely be unable to carry out capital spending and exploration activities that are important to our growth  and we have recently been  and may from time to time be  out of compliance with covenants under our credit facility  which will require us to seek waivers from our banks  which may be more difficult to obtain in the current economic environment 
as discussed above  the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility requires us to repay significant amounts outstanding under our credit facility in the near term  and failure to do so could result in acceleration of amounts due thereunder 
we may incur additional debt  including secured indebtedness  or issue preferred stock in order to maintain adequate liquidity  develop our properties and make future acquisitions 
a higher level of indebtedness and or preferred stock increases the risk that we may default on our obligations 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance 
general economic conditions  natural gas and oil prices and financial  business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions  the value of our assets  the number of shares of capital stock we have authorized  unissued and unreserved and our performance at the time we need capital 
in addition  our bank borrowing base is subject to periodic redetermination 
a further reduction to our borrowing base could require us to repay indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base  or we might be required to provide the lenders with additional collateral 
we are currently engaged in seeking capital from a number of sources  including sales of debt or equity securities  asset sales  and potential joint ventures or similar industry partnerships directed  in part  to raising 
table of contents capital needed to repay indebtedness that is due as a result of the borrowing base redetermination as contemplated by the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility 
the current financial crisis may have impacts on our business and financial condition that we cannot predict 
the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system may continue to have an impact on our business and our financial condition  and we may continue to face challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve 
although we believe we have developed an operating and capital budget for and that  assuming we are successful in meeting our obligations under the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility  will allow us to fund our business with anticipated internally generated cash flow  cash resources and other sources of liquidity  such sources historically have not been sufficient to fund all of our expenditures  and we have relied on the capital markets and asset monetization transactions to provide us with additional capital 
our ability to access the capital markets has been restricted as a result of this crisis and may be restricted in the future when we would like  or need  to raise capital 
the financial crisis may also limit the number of prospects for our potential joint venture or asset monetization transactions that we are marketing or reduce the values we are able to realize in those transactions  making these transactions uneconomic or difficult to consummate and limit our ability to attract joint venture partners to develop our reserves 
the economic situation could also adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging arrangements  if any  to be ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection 
additionally  the current economic situation could lead to further reduced demand for natural gas and oil  or lower prices for natural gas and oil  or both  which would have a negative impact on our revenues 
we have recently engaged in  and marketed certain of our assets in  joint venture transactions that monetize  or would monetize  a portion of our investment in certain plays and provide drilling cost carries for our retained interest 
if our joint venture partners in these transactions and proposed transactions  if completed  were not able to meet their obligations under these arrangements  we may be required to fund these expenditures from other sources or reduce our drilling activities 
information concerning our reserves is uncertain 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and cash flows from such reserves  including factors beyond our control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of oil and natural gas reserves  or of cash flows attributable to such reserves  is a function of the available data  assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices  availability and terms of financing  expenditures for future development and exploitation activities  and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
reserves and future cash flows may also be subject to material downward or upward revisions based upon production history  development and exploitation activities  oil and natural gas prices and regulatory changes 
actual future production  revenue  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses  quantities of recoverable reserves and value of cash flows from those reserves may vary significantly from our assumptions and estimates 
in addition  reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data 
further  the difficult financing environment may inhibit our ability to finance development of our reserves in the future 
the estimated quantities of proved reserves and the discounted present value of future net cash flows attributable to those reserves as of december   and included in our periodic reports filed with the sec were prepared by our independent reserve engineers in accordance with the rules of the sec  and are not intended to represent the fair market value of such reserves 
as required by the sec  the estimated discounted present value of future net cash flows from proved reserves is generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
in addition  the discount factor  which the sec requires to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the oil and gas industry in general 
with the further decline in commodity pricing since year end  the proved undeveloped reserves attributable to our piceance basin properties are uneconomic using the spot natural gas price as of february  the piceance basin properties contain nearly all of our proved undeveloped reserves 
further development of these properties depends on higher commodity prices in the future  reductions in future drilling costs  or a combination of both 

table of contents we may not be able to replace production with new reserves 
our reserves will decline significantly as they are produced unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful development and exploration drilling activities 
our future oil and natural gas production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves that are economically feasible and developing existing proved reserves 
exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves 
we do not always encounter commercially productive reservoirs through our drilling operations 
the new wells we drill or participate in may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in wells we drill or participate in 
the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is often uncertain  and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project 
our efforts will be unprofitable if we drill dry wells or wells that are productive but do not produce enough reserves to return a profit after drilling  operating and other costs 
further  our drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including increases in the cost of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  drilling rigs and equipment  unexpected drilling conditions  title problems  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  and compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements 
if oil or natural gas prices decrease or exploration and development efforts are unsuccessful  we may be required to take further writedowns 
in the past  we have been required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and other assets 
there is a risk that we will be required to take additional writedowns in the future  which would reduce our earnings and stockholders equity 
a writedown could occur when oil and natural gas prices are low or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves  increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our exploration and development results 
we account for our crude oil and natural gas exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
if the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties exceeds the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows  we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to their estimated fair value 
we review our oil and gas properties for impairment quarterly or whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
once incurred  a writedown of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if gas or oil prices increase 
given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets  events may arise that would require us to record an impairment of the recorded carrying values associated with our oil and gas properties 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded an 
table of contents impairment provision to our proved and unproved properties for the year ended december  totaling approximately million primarily related to the newton  midway loop  opossum hollow and angleton fields in texas million  paradox field in utah million  howard ranch and bull canyon fields in the rockies million  utah hingeline million and our offshore california field million 
the impairments were primarily due to the significant decline in commodity pricing during the fourth quarter of in addition  we recorded impairments to our paradox pipeline million  certain dhs rigs million and we wrote off dhs s goodwill million 
during the year ended december   impairments of million were recorded primarily related to the howard ranch and fuller fields in wyoming million and million  respectively  and the south angleton field in texas million  primarily due to lower rocky mountain natural gas prices and marginally economic deep zones on the howard ranch prospect 
for  we are continuing to develop and evaluate certain properties on which favorable or unfavorable results or commodity prices may cause us to revise in future years our estimates of those properties future cash flows 
such revisions of estimates could require us to record an impairment in the period of such revisions 
during  we recorded dry hole costs totaling million for nine wells in utah  four wells in texas  two wells in wyoming  two wells in california  one well in louisiana and a non operated project in the columbia river basin 
during  we recorded dry hole costs for three wells located in texas  two wells in wyoming  one well in colorado and one well in utah totaling approximately million 
at december   we had million classified as exploratory work in process related primarily to our columbia river basin well currently being drilled 
during  these costs will be capitalized as successful wells if proved reserves are found or expensed as dry holes based on final drilling results 
lower natural gas and oil prices have negatively impacted  and could continue to negatively impact  our ability to borrow 
our revolving bank credit facility limits our borrowings to the lesser of the borrowing base and the total commitments 
the borrowing base is determined periodically at the discretion of the banks and is based in part on natural gas and oil prices 
additionally  the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness in addition to that incurred under our revolving bank credit facility 
these agreements limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness unless we meet one of two alternative tests 
the first alternative is based on our adjusted consolidated net tangible assets as defined in our lending agreements  which is determined using discounted future net revenues from proved natural gas and oil reserves as of the end of each year 
the second alternative is based on the ratio of our consolidated ebitdax as defined in the relevant indentures to our adjusted consolidated interest expense over a trailing twelve month period 
currently  we are permitted to incur additional indebtedness under both debt incurrence tests  however  our borrowing base has been redetermined at a level that will not permit additional borrowing under our credit facility 
lower natural gas and oil prices in the future could reduce our consolidated ebitdax  as well as our adjusted consolidated net tangible assets  and thus could reduce our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
lower natural gas and oil prices could also further reduce the borrowing base under our revolving bank credit facility  and if such borrowing base were reduced below the amount of borrowings outstanding  we would be required to repay an amount of borrowings such that outstanding borrowings do not exceed the borrowing base 
pursuant to the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility  our borrowing base under the credit facility was reduced to million  and we are required to pay down the million difference between the amount borrowed under the prior million borrowing base from the proceeds of our anticipated capital raising efforts  asset sales and other cash sources 
the exploration  development and operation of oil and gas properties involve substantial risks that may result in a total loss of investment 
the business of exploring for and  to a lesser extent  developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk  and thus a substantial risk of investment loss that even a combination of experience  knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome 
oil and gas drilling and production activities may be shortened  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include 
table of contents availability of capital  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse changes in prices  adverse weather conditions  title problems  shortages in experienced labor  and increases in the cost of  or shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment 
the cost to develop our proved reserves as of december  is estimated to be approximately billion 
in the current financing environment  we expect it to be difficult to obtain that capital and it may limit our success in attracting joint venture or industry partners to develop our reserves 
we may drill wells that are unproductive or  although productive  do not produce oil and or natural gas in economic quantities 
acquisition and completion decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that are speculative 
it is impossible to predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well 
furthermore  a successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment 
a variety of geological  operational  or market related factors  including  but not limited to  unusual or unexpected geological formations  pressures  equipment failures or accidents  fires  explosions  blowouts  cratering  pollution and other environmental risks  shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment  loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable 
a productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the production of oil and or natural gas from the well  or in the event of lower than expected commodity prices 
in addition  production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other deleterious substances 
the marketability of our production depends mostly upon the availability  proximity and capacity of gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities  which are owned by third parties 
the marketability of our production depends upon the availability  operation and capacity of gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities  which are owned by third parties 
the unavailability or lack of capacity of these systems and facilities could result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties 
united states federal  state and foreign regulation of oil and gas production and transportation  tax and energy policies  damage to or destruction of pipelines  general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas 
if market factors changed dramatically  the financial impact on us could be substantial 
the availability of markets and the volatility of product prices are beyond our control and represent a significant risk 
prices may be affected by regional factors 
the prices to be received for the natural gas production from our rocky mountain region properties  where we are conducting a substantial portion of our development activities  will be determined to a significant extent by factors affecting the regional supply of and demand for natural gas  including the adequacy of the pipeline and processing infrastructure in the region to process  and transport  our production and that of other producers 
those factors result in basis differentials between the published indices generally used to establish the price received for regional natural gas production and the actual frequently lower price we receive for our production 

table of contents our industry experiences numerous operating hazards that could result in substantial losses 
the exploration  development and operation of oil and gas properties also involve a variety of operating risks including the risk of fire  explosions  blowouts  cratering  pipe failure  abnormally pressured formations  natural disasters  acts of terrorism or vandalism  and environmental hazards  including oil spills  gas leaks  pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases 
these industry operating risks can result in injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  and suspension of operations which could result in substantial losses 
we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
such insurance may not be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
also  we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
terrorist attacks and certain potential natural disasters may change our ability to obtain adequate insurance coverage 
the occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations 
we depend on key personnel 
we currently have only four employees that serve in senior management roles 
in particular  roger a 
parker and john r 
wallace are responsible for the operation of our oil and gas business  kevin k 
nanke is our treasurer and chief financial officer  and stanley f 
freedman is our executive vice president  general counsel and secretary 
the loss of any one of these employees could severely harm our business 
we do not have key man insurance on the lives of any of these individuals 
furthermore  competition for experienced personnel is intense 
if we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel  our ability to compete could be adversely affected 
we may not be permitted to develop some of our offshore california properties or  if we are permitted  the substantial cost to develop these properties could result in a reduction of our interest in these properties or cause us to incur penalties 
certain of our offshore california undeveloped properties  in which we have ownership interests ranging from to  are attributable to our interests in four of our five federal units plus one additional lease located offshore of california near santa barbara 
these properties had a cost basis of approximately million at december  the development of these properties is subject to extensive regulation and is currently the subject of litigation 
further actions to develop these properties have been delayed pending the outcome of a lawsuit that was filed in the united states court of federal claims in washington  dc by us  our owned subsidiary  amber resources company of colorado  and ten other property owners alleging that the us government materially breached the terms of forty undeveloped federal leases  some of which are part of our offshore california properties 
none of these leases is currently impaired  but in the event that they are found not to be valid for some reason  in the future it would appear that they would become impaired 
for example  if there is a future adverse ruling by the california coastal commission under the coastal zone management act and we decide not to appeal such ruling to the secretary of commerce  or the secretary of commerce either refuses to hear our appeal of any such ruling or ultimately makes an adverse determination  it is likely that some or all of these leases would become impaired and written off at that time 
it is also possible that other events could occur that would cause the leases to become impaired  and we will continuously evaluate those factors as they occur 
in addition  the cost to develop these properties will be substantial 
the cost to develop all of the offshore california properties in which we own an interest  including delineation wells  environmental mitigation  development wells  fixed platforms  fixed platform facilities  pipelines and power cables  onshore facilities and platform removal over the life of the properties assumed to be years  is estimated to be in excess of billion 
our share of such costs  based on our current ownership interest  is estimated to be over million 
operating expenses for the same properties over the same period of time  including platform operating costs  well maintenance and repair costs  oil  gas and water treating costs  lifting costs and pipeline transportation costs  are estimated to be approximately billion  with our share  based on our current ownership interest  estimated to be approximately million 
there will be additional costs of a currently undetermined amount to develop the rocky point unit 
each working interest owner will be required to pay its proportionate share of these costs based upon the amount of the interest that it owns 
if we are unable to fund our share of these costs or otherwise cover them through farm outs or other arrangements  
table of contents then we could either forfeit our interest in certain wells or properties or suffer other penalties in the form of delayed or reduced revenues under our various unit operating agreements  which could impact the ultimate realization of this investment 
the estimates discussed above may differ significantly from actual results 
we are exposed to additional risks through our drilling business  dhs 
we currently have a ownership interest in and management control of dhs  a drilling business 
the operations of that entity are subject to many additional hazards that are inherent to the drilling business  including  for example  blowouts  cratering  fires  explosions  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drill strings and damage or loss from inclement weather 
no assurance can be given that the insurance coverage maintained by that entity will be sufficient to protect it against liability for all consequences of well disasters  personal injury  extensive fire damage or damage to the environment 
no assurance can be given that the drilling business will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers reasonable or that any particular types of coverage will be available 
the occurrence of events  including any of the above mentioned risks and hazards that are not fully insured  could subject the drilling business to significant liability 
it is also possible that we might sustain significant losses through the operation of the drilling business even if none of such events occurs 
dhs has significant near term liquidity issues 
there is a significant risk that dhs will not be able to meet its debt covenants under its credit facility 
dhs currently has only three of its nineteen rigs currently in operation and expects to incur liquidity pressures during due to the industry wide decrease in drilling activities 
dhs is now highly leveraged relative to its currently reduced cash flow and its lender  lehman commercial paper  inc  has filed for bankruptcy protection 
dhs is in the process of attempting to procure alternative financing from other sources with more favorable debt terms  but there can be no assurance that its efforts will be successful 
at december   dhs owed million under its credit facility 
in the event that dhs is not successful in obtaining alternative financing or making satisfactory arrangements with the lehman commercial paper  inc bankruptcy trustee  it is likely that dhs will be in default of its debt covenants under its credit facility in unless market conditions improve significantly 
in such event  all of the amounts due under the credit facility would become immediately due and payable 
all of the dhs rigs are pledged as collateral for the credit facility  and would be subject to foreclosure in the event of a default under the credit facility 
while the dhs credit facility is non recourse to delta  delta is a significant creditor of dhs  with accounts payable to dhs of million as of december  hedging transactions may limit our potential gains or cause us to lose money 
in order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of oil and gas  we periodically enter into oil and gas price hedging arrangements  typically costless collars 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and gas prices  such transactions  depending on the hedging instrument used  may limit our potential gains if oil and gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which production is substantially less than expected  the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts  or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts gas or oil prices 
the total gains on derivative instruments recognized in our statements of operations were million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had no outstanding hedging arrangements 
however  in accordance with the terms of our forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility  we expect to put derivative contracts in place to establish a floor price for our anticipated production of a minimum of for the last two quarters of  for the calendar year and for the calendar year 
table of contents we may not receive payment for a portion of our future production 
our revenues are derived principally from uncollateralized sales to customers in the oil and gas industry 
the concentration of credit risk in a single industry affects our overall exposure to credit risk because customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions 
although we have not been directly affected  we are aware that some refiners have filed for bankruptcy protection  which has caused the affected producers to not receive payment for the production that was delivered 
if economic conditions continue to deteriorate  it is likely that additional  similar situations will occur which will expose us to added risk of not being paid for oil or gas that we deliver 
we do not attempt to obtain credit protections such as letters of credit  guarantees or prepayments from our purchasers 
we are unable to predict what impact the financial difficulties of any of our purchasers may have on our future results of operations and liquidity 
we have no long term contracts to sell oil and gas 
we do not have any long term supply or similar agreements with governments or other authorities or entities for which we act as a producer 
we are therefore dependent upon our ability to sell oil and gas at the prevailing wellhead market price 
there can be no assurance that purchasers will be available or that the prices they are willing to pay will remain stable and not decline 
terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities could adversely affect our business 
the united states has been the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scale 
the us government has issued warnings that us energy assets may be the future targets of terrorist organizations 
these developments have subjected our operations to increased risks 
any terrorist attack at our facilities  or those of our purchasers  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we own properties in the gulf coast region that could be susceptible to damage by severe weather 
certain areas in and near the gulf of mexico experience hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions on a relatively frequent basis 
some of our properties in the gulf coast region are located in areas that could cause them to be susceptible to damage by these storms 
damage caused by high winds and flooding could potentially cause us to curtail operations and or exploration and development activities on such properties for significant periods of time until damage can be repaired 
moreover  even if our properties are not directly damaged by such storms  we may experience disruptions in our ability to sell our production due to damage to pipelines  roads and other transportation and refining facilities in the area 
we may incur substantial costs to comply with the various federal  state and local laws and regulations that affect our oil and gas operations 
we are affected significantly by a substantial amount of governmental regulations that increase costs related to the drilling of wells and the transportation and processing of oil and gas 
it is possible that the number and extent of these regulations  and the costs to comply with them  will increase significantly in the future 
in colorado  for example  significant new governmental regulations have been adopted that are primarily driven by concerns about wildlife and the environment 
these government regulatory requirements complicate our plans for development and may result in substantial costs that are not possible to pass through to our customers and which could impact the profitability of our colorado operations 
our oil and gas operations are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety  land use  environmental protection or the oil and gas industry generally 
legislation affecting the industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion  frequently increasing our regulatory burden 
compliance with such laws and regulations often increases our cost of doing business and  in turn  decreases our profitability 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations  or issuance of cease and desist orders 

table of contents the environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject may require applying for and receiving a permit before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance  and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our earnings  results of operations  competitive position or financial condition 
over the years  we have owned or leased numerous properties for oil and gas activities upon which petroleum hydrocarbons or other materials may have been released by us or by predecessor property owners or lessees who were not under our control 
under applicable environmental laws and regulations  including cercla  rcra and analogous state laws  we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination at such locations regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or if our operations were standard in the industry at the time they were performed 
we may be unable to draw funds from our existing credit facilities 
our subsidiary  dhs drilling company  has a credit facility with lehman commercial paper  inc lehman 
during the year ended december   dhs paid a deposit of million for the acquisition of a drilling rig that was expected to close in october because of the bankruptcy of lehman and the inability of lehman to fund  dhs was unable to close on the acquisition and forfeited its deposit 
we maintain a credit facility underwritten by a syndicate of financial institutions that we use to fund our capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
if the financial institutions underwriting our credit facility file for bankruptcy or otherwise refuse our funding requests  we may incur unforeseen expenses  lose business opportunities  or become unable to make payments when due 
we are exposed to credit risk as it affects third parties with whom we have contracted 
third parties with whom we have contracted may lose existing financing or be unable to obtain additional financing necessary to continue their businesses 
the inability of a third party to make payments to us for our accounts receivable  or the failure of our third party suppliers to meet our demands because they cannot obtain sufficient credit to continue their operations  may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity and our ability to make our payments when due 
risks related to our stock 
our largest stockholder has the power to significantly influence the future of our company 
as of february   our largest stockholder  tracinda corporation  beneficially owned  shares of our common stock  or approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
pursuant to the company stock purchase agreement that we entered into with tracinda corporation on december   tracinda corporation has certain rights  including the right to designate five members of our board of directors which number will increase after february  to equal its percentage ownership of delta  preemptive rights in connection with future equity issuances by us  and consent rights over certain types of actions 
tracinda has informed us that they intend to nominate two additional directors at our next meeting of stockholders 
while tracinda corporation agreed not to acquire more than of our outstanding common stock until february   after such date there are no limitations as to the number of our outstanding shares of common stock that tracinda corporation may acquire 
consequently  tracinda corporation has the power to significantly influence matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors  and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may make it more difficult for other stockholders 
table of contents to effect substantial changes in our company and may also have the effect of delaying  preventing or expediting  as the case may be  a change in control of our company 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  or the perception that such sales might occur  could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
approximately of our common stock is held by institutional investors who now each have ownership of greater than of our common stock 
sales by tracinda corporation  or other of our large institutional investors  of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the public market  or the perception that such sales might occur  could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
we may issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our stockholders 
any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock  in terms of dividends  liquidation rights and voting rights 
there may be future dilution of our common stock 
to the extent options to purchase common stock under our employee and director stock option plans or outstanding warrants to purchase common stock are exercised or the price vesting triggers under the performance shares granted to our executive officers are satisfied  holders of our common stock will experience dilution 
as of december   we had outstanding options to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of 
further  if we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities  such sales could result in increased dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the price of our outstanding securities to decline 
we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock 
we have never paid dividends with respect to our common stock  and we do not expect to pay any dividends  in cash or otherwise  in the foreseeable future 
we intend to retain any earnings for use in our business 
in addition  the credit agreement relating to our credit facility prohibits us from paying any dividends and the indenture governing our senior notes restricts our ability to pay dividends 
in the future  we may agree to further restrictions 
the common stock is an unsecured equity interest in our company 
as an equity interest  our common stock is not secured by any of our assets 
therefore  in the event we are liquidated  the holders of the common stock will receive a distribution only after all of our secured and unsecured creditors have been paid in full 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets after paying our secured and unsecured creditors to make any distribution to the holders of the common stock 
our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights 
holders of our common stock are not entitled to accumulate their votes for the election of directors or otherwise 
accordingly  a plurality of holders of our outstanding common stock will be able to elect all of our directors 
as of december   our directors and executive officers and their respective affiliates collectively and beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation  delaware law and certain of our contracts may have provisions that discourage corporate takeovers and could prevent stockholders from realizing a premium on their investment 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  the provisions of the delaware general corporation law and certain of our contracts may discourage persons from considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals or require that such persons negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue non negotiated takeover attempts 
these provisions may discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control 
as a result  these provisions could have the effect of preventing stockholders from realizing a premium on their investment 

table of contents our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to set the rights  preferences and other designations  including voting rights of those shares  as the board of directors may determine 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation authorizes a substantial number of shares of common stock in excess of the shares outstanding 
these provisions may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to stockholders for their common stock 
under our credit facility  a change in control is an event of default 
under the indenture governing our senior notes  upon the occurrence of a change in control  the holders of our senior notes will have the right  subject to certain conditions  to require us to repurchase their notes at a price equal to of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the repurchase

table of contents item properties 
properties 
our primary areas of activity are in the rocky mountain and gulf coast regions with additional strategic exploration projects in the columbia river basin in southeastern washington and the hingeline area of central utah 
total oil and gas leasehold in these areas comprises approximately  acres 
rocky mountain region the rocky mountain region comprises approximately of our estimated proved reserves as of december  the majority of our undeveloped acreage and drilling inventory is located in this region  where our drilling efforts and capital expenditures have been focused 
in the rocky mountains  although we have significant acreage in four basins  we have dedicated the majority of our development efforts to our position in the piceance basin 
piceance basin 
since we have dedicated significant financial capital and human resources to the development of our vega unit and surrounding leasehold in mesa county  colorado  which in combination is referred to as the vega area 
in we acquired an additional  net acres  which increased our position to approximately  net acres  which has over  net drilling locations on acre spacing 
we also have a non operated working interest in the garden gulch field in garfield county  colorado 
these fields are consistent with our strategy of targeting reservoirs that demonstrate predictable geology over large areas 
the williams fork member of the mesaverde formation is the primary producing interval and has been successfully developed throughout the piceance basin 
vega area 
the vega area includes the vega unit  the north vega leasehold  the buzzard creek unit  and north buzzard creek leasehold 
our working interest in the vega area varies between 
during fiscal we increased proved reserves in the vega area over to bcfe 
during production increased from approximately mmcf d at the beginning of the year to approximately mmcf d at the end of the collbran valley natural gas pipeline provides us with approximately mmcf d of pipeline takeaway capacity 
a new pipeline is currently under construction that will provide us with takeaway capacity up to mmcf d 
we ended with wells producing 
despite our large inventory of over  drilling locations and efficient reserve growth  we have decreased our drilling program from four rigs to one rig at year end  primarily due to the decrease of natural gas prices and liquidity concerns 
since we have experienced significant reductions in drill time  and drilling and completion costs  which have allowed us to grow reserves even in a depressed commodity price environment 
we expect to continue completion activities in on wells awaiting completion  and to resume its more aggressive drilling program once commodity prices recover 
our drilling and completion capital budget is million for the year ending december  garden gulch 
we have an interest in approximately  gross  net acres with a non operated working interest 
the operator of the project has temporarily ceased drilling activity  but expects to complete an inventory of approximately wells that were drilled  but not completed in our capital budget for the year ending december  is approximately million 
paradox basin 
in the paradox basin we have five prospect areas greentown  salt valley  fisher valley  gypsum valley and cocklebur draw 
over the past three years we focused primarily on the greentown prospect  in grand county  utah 
the targeted objectives in these prospects are reliant upon various geologic models  which include multiple stacked clastic intervals imbedded within an evaporate salt in the paradox formation  and unconventional shales 
greentown 
we have drilled a total of eight wells in the greentown project area 
the first two wells flow tested at rates between mmcf d with bo d and mmcf d with bo d  primarily from the st clastic interval  or o zone 
these first two exploration wells were located approximately along the axis of the anticline  about seven miles apart 
even though these wells are widely spaced  they exhibited very consistent electric log characteristics and appear analogous and mapable over a large area 
although these first two exploration wells were lost due to casing failure  the flow rates and log characteristics drove our initial assessment was that the geology was 
table of contents consistent and predictable over much of our leasehold 
we revised our casing design in the subsequent wells  and continued to experience multiple hydrocarbon bearing zones while drilling 
each of the subsequent wells tested gas and oil  two of which tested at significant rates of up to mmcf d 
most of the gas and oil tested in these wells came from the o interval  but some also produced from the rd clastic interval  also known as the cane creek 
despite the indications of economically productive reserves during drilling and initial completion activity  the wells failed to produce at the flow tested rates after casing and completion activities 
we assessed that the limited productivity was primarily due to a lack of naturally occurring fractures in the clastics 
in order to encounter more naturally occurring fractures we drilled multiple laterals in three of the wells  within the o and cane creek intervals 
in one of the first laterals in the greentown federal d well  in the o interval  we encountered significant hydrocarbon accumulation with high pressures 
while trying to complete the lateral we encountered significant mechanical problems that made the potentially productive section inaccessible 
the other laterals encountered limited hydrocarbon accumulations 
based upon the results from the laterals and limited production on the western portion of the acreage  we have determined that despite good correlation of the clastic intervals along the crest of the greentown anticline  there exists discontinuity in the clastic intervals  which may limit the hydrocarbon drainage area on the western portion 
we have a working interest in  gross acres   net acres 
we believe the eastern portion of its acreage  where the wells with letter drilling shows were located  remains prospective

under a restitution theory of damages  the court ruled that the government must give back to the current lessees the more than billion in lease bonuses it had received at the time of sale 
on january   the government filed a motion for reconsideration of the court s ruling as it relates to a single lease owned entirely by us lease 
in its motion for reconsideration  the government asserted that we should not be able to recover lease bonus payments for lease because  allegedly  a significant portion of the hydrocarbons had been drained by wells that were drilled on an immediately adjacent lease

impairment of long lived assets on a quarterly basis  we compare our historical cost basis of each proved developed and undeveloped oil and gas property to its expected future undiscounted net cash flow from each property on a field by field basis 
estimates of expected future cash flows represent management s best estimate based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
if the expected future net cash flows exceed the carrying value of the property  no impairment is recognized 
if the carrying value of the property exceeds the expected future cash flows  an impairment exists and is measured by the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded an impairment provision to our proved and unproved properties for the year ended december  totaling approximately million primarily related to the newton  midway loop  opossum hollow and angleton fields in texas million  paradox field in utah million  howard ranch and bull canyon fields in the rockies million  hingeline field in utah million and our offshore california field million 
the impairments resulted primarily from the significant decline in commodity pricing during the fourth quarter of in addition  we recorded impairments to our paradox pipeline million  certain dhs rigs million and we wrote off dhs goodwill million 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment provision of approximately million to developed properties primarily related to the howard ranch and fuller fields in wyoming million and

shareholder derivative suit within the past few years  there has been significant focus on corporate governance and accounting practices in the grant of equity based awards to executives and employees of publicly traded companies  including the use of market hindsight to select award dates to favor award recipients 
after being identified in a third party report as statistically being at risk for possibly backdating option grants  in may our board of directors created a special committee comprised of outside directors 
the special committee  which was advised by independent legal counsel and advisors  
table of contents undertook a comprehensive review of our historical stock option practices and related accounting treatment 
in june we received a subpoena from the us attorney for the southern district of new york and an inquiry from the staff of the sec related to our stock option grants and related practices 
the special committee of our board of directors reported to the board that  while its review revealed deficiencies in the documentation of our option grants in prior years  there was no evidence of option backdating or other misconduct by our executives or directors in the timing or selection of our option grant dates  or that would cause us to conclude that our prior accounting for stock option grants was incorrect in any material respect 
we provided the results of the internal investigation to the us attorney and to the sec in august of  and were subsequently informed by both agencies that the matter had been closed 
during september and october of  three separate shareholder derivative actions were filed on our behalf in us district court for the district of colorado relating to the options backdating issue  all of which were consolidated into a single action 
the consolidated complaint alleged that certain of our executive officers and directors engaged in various types of misconduct in connection with certain stock option grants 
specifically  the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant directors  in their capacity as members of our board of directors and our audit or compensation committee  at the behest of the defendants who are or were officers and to benefit themselves  backdated our stock option grants to make it appear as though they were granted on a prior date when our stock price was lower 
they alleged that these backdated options unduly benefited the defendants who are or were officers and or directors  resulted in our issuing materially inaccurate and misleading financial statements and caused us to incur substantial damages 
the action also sought to have the current and former officers and directors who are defendants disgorge to us certain options they received  including the proceeds of options exercised  as well as certain equitable relief and attorneys fees and costs 
on september   the court entered an order dismissing the action for failing to plead sufficient facts to support the claims that were made in the complaint  and stayed the dismissal for ten days to allow the plaintiffs to file a motion for leave to file an amended complaint 
extensions were granted and the plaintiffs filed such a motion on october  on september   the court entered an order granting plaintiff s motion for leave to amend 
on october   the defendants including us as a nominal defendant filed a joint motion to dismiss the second amended complaint

our core areas of operation are the rocky mountain and gulf coast regions  which comprise the majority of our proved reserves  production and long term growth prospects 
we have a significant drilling inventory that consists of proved and unproved locations  the majority of which are located in our rocky mountain development projects 
at december   we had estimated proved reserves that totaled bcfe  of which were proved developed  with an after tax pv value of million 
for the year ended december   we reported net production of mmcfe per day 
as of december   our reserves were comprised of approximately bcf of natural gas and mmbbls of crude oil  or gas on an equivalent basis 
approximately of our proved reserves were located in the rocky mountains  in the gulf coast and less than in other locations 
we expect that our drilling efforts and capital expenditures will focus increasingly on the rockies  where approximately of our fiscal drilling budget is allocated and more than one half of our undeveloped acreage is located 
as of december   we controlled approximately  net undeveloped acres  representing approximately of our total acreage position 
we retain a high degree of operational control over our asset base  with an average working interest in excess of excluding our columbia river basin properties as of december  this provides us with controlling interests in a multi year inventory of drilling locations  positioning us for continued reserve and production growth through our drilling operations when commodity prices support such activity 
we also have a controlling ownership interest in a drilling company  providing the benefit of access to drilling rigs primarily located in the rocky mountain region 
we concentrate our exploration and development efforts in fields where we can apply our technical exploration and development expertise  and where we have accumulated significant operational control and experience 

table of contents recent developments during the year ended december  we increased proved reserves to bcfe at december   an increase of  or before considering current year purchases  compared to proved reserves as of december  of bcfe 
continued success from our rocky mountain drilling activities has increased our production from continuing operations by for the year ended december  to mcfe  compared to mcfe for the prior year period 
we commenced drilling of our first operated columbia river basin well and attracted a joint venture partner  selling a working interest participation in all of our columbia river basin leasehold interests  including our current exploration project 
we recorded an impairment provision to our proved and unproved properties and other assets for the year ended december  totaling approximately million  primarily related to texas  utah  and our offshore california field 
the impairments resulted primarily from the significant decline in commodity pricing during the fourth quarter of in addition  we recorded impairments to our paradox basin pipeline  certain dhs rigs and we wrote off dhs s goodwill 
subsequent to year end  on march   we entered into the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility pursuant to which the lenders under our credit facility agreed to forbear from taking certain actions including accelerating amounts due under the credit facility as a result of our violations of certain of our covenants under the credit facility 
in addition  the agreement amends our debt to ebitdax covenant to a senior secured debt to ebitdax covenant  reduces the borrowing base from million to million  thereby requiring us to repay the million borrowed in excess of the borrowing base  as discussed below  and increases our variable interest rates 
the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility requires that we raise net proceeds of at least million through our capital raising efforts on or before the forbearance termination date 
outlook we expect our oil and gas production to stay relatively flat to levels due to the limited drilling program we expect for for calendar year  we have preliminarily established a drilling and completion budget of approximately million 
we are concentrating a substantial portion of this budget on the development of our piceance basin assets in the rockies  and to a lesser extent  our columbia river basin exploration 
the exploration for and the acquisition  development  production  and sale of  natural gas and crude oil are highly competitive and capital intensive 
as in any commodity business  the market price of the commodity produced and the costs associated with finding  acquiring  extracting  and financing the operation are critical to profitability and long term value creation for stockholders 
generating reserve and production growth represents an ongoing focus for management  and is made particularly important in our business given the natural production and reserve decline associated with producing oil and gas properties 
in the current depressed commodity price and general economic environment  we  and others in our industry  face major short term challenges  including our continued ability to satisfy our debt covenants  to meet our obligations as they become due  and to sustain ourselves as a going concern 
we have taken the following steps to mitigate the challenges we face 
we have entered into the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility  and are actively engaged in pursuing potential capital raising activities such as sales of debt or equity securities  asset sales and potential joint ventures or other industry partnerships in order to pay down our debt outstanding and reduce our payables  we have reduced our capital expenditure program  and we intend to implement additional cost saving measures 
our longer term business strengths include a multi year inventory of attractive drilling on long lived rockies properties  which we believe will allow us to grow reserves and replace and expand production organically without having to rely solely on acquisitions 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to access cash 
as shown in the accompanying financial statements  we experienced a net loss of million for the year ended december   we were not in compliance with certain of the debt covenants under our credit facility  and are facing significant immediate requirements to fund obligations in excess of our existing sources of liquidity 
our accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern  however  due to our deficiency in short term and long term liquidity  our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our success in generating additional sources of capital in the near future 
we have received a report from our independent registered certified public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   in which our auditors have included an explanatory paragraph indicating that the we have suffered recurring losses from operations  have a working capital deficiency and were not in compliance with our debt covenants as of december  which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
during the year ended december   we had an operating loss of million  but generated cash from operating activities of million and obtained cash from financing activities of million 
during this period we spent million on oil and gas development  million on oil and gas acquisitions or million  net of million proceeds from dispositions and million on drilling and trucking capital expenditures or million  net of million proceeds from dispositions 
at december   we had million in cash  total assets of billion and a debt to capitalization ratio of 
debt at december  totaled million  comprised of million of bank debt million of which was classified as current at december   million of long term installments payable  million of senior subordinated notes and million of senior convertible notes 
in november  we refinanced our senior credit facility increasing our total borrowing base to million  of which million was initially available 
our covenants require a minimum current ratio of to  excluding the fair value of derivative instruments  and a consolidated debt to ebitdax earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and exploration of less than to for the quarter ended december   and to for the period ended march   to for the period ended june   to for the period ended september  and to for the period ended december  and each quarter thereafter 
this consolidated debt to ebitdax covenant was modified by the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility to require that senior secured debt to consolidated ebitdax for the preceding four consecutive quarters be less than to these financial covenant calculations include only wholly owned subsidiaries 
at december   we were not in compliance with our minimum current ratio and accounts payable covenants under the credit facility and accordingly we have classified the million of debt outstanding under the bank credit facility at december  as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  pursuant to the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility  the borrowing base under our credit facility will be reduced upon the successful completion of our capital raising efforts to million  which will require a repayment of million based on outstanding borrowings of million at march  under the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility the lenders have provided us relief for a period ending april  at the earliest and no longer than june  depending on the progress of our capital raising efforts  from acting upon their rights and remedies as a result of our violation of accounts payable and current ratio covenants 
the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility requires that we raise net proceeds of at least million through our capital raising efforts on or before the forbearance termination date in order to reduce our outstanding credit facility borrowings and reduce accounts payable 
it also limits our capital expenditures in the second and third quarter of  though these limitations are consistent with our capital expenditure plans 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have approximately million of accounts payable at december   which if not timely paid could result in liens filed against our properties or withdrawal of trade credit provided by vendors  which in turn could limit our availability to conduct operations on our properties 
we are pursuing additional capital from a variety of potential sources  including sales of debt or equity securities  asset sales  joint ventures and other similar industry partnerships 
in august  dhs closed a new million credit facility with lehman brothers commercial paper  inc lehman as administrative agent 
at december   dhs owed million under its credit facility and as a result of the lehman bankruptcy  dhs has no additional availability under its credit facility 
in the event that dhs is not successful in obtaining alternative financing or making satisfactory arrangements with the lehman bankruptcy trustee  it likely that dhs will be in default of its debt covenants under its credit facility in unless market conditions improve significantly 
in such event  all of the amounts due under the credit facility would become immediately due and payable 
as of december   our corporate rating and senior unsecured debt rating were caa and caa  respectively  as issued by moody s investors service 
moody s outlook is stable 
as of december   our corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings were b and ccc  respectively  as issued by standard and poor s s p 
s p s outlook on the rating was stable 
subsequent to year end  s p placed our corporate rating on credit watch due to liquidity and debt concerns 
further  moody s downgraded our corporate rating and senior unsecured debt rating to caa and caa  respectively 
in addition  moody s outlook on the rating was changed to negative 
our future cash requirements are largely dependent upon the number and timing of projects included in our capital development plan  most of which are discretionary 
we have historically addressed our long term liquidity requirements through the issuance of debt and equity securities when market conditions permit  through cash provided by operating activities  sales of oil and gas properties  and through borrowings under our credit facility 
the prices we receive for future oil and natural gas production and the level of production have a significant impact on our operating cash flows 
we are unable to predict with any degree of certainty the prices we will receive for our future oil and gas production and the success of our exploration and production activities in generating additional production 
there can be no assurance that the actions undertaken by us will be sufficient to repay the obligations under the credit facility as required by the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility  or  if not  or if additional defaults occur under that facility  that the lenders will be willing to waive further defaults or amend the facility 
in addition  there can be no 
table of contents assurance that results of operations and other sources of liquidity  including asset sales  will be sufficient to meet contractual  operating and capital obligations 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of uncertainty regarding our ability to raise additional capital  sell assets  obtain sufficient funds to meet our obligations or to continue as a going concern 
although we believe that through cash on hand  cash flows from operations  and assuming the success of our capital raising efforts as discussed above  we will have access to adequate capital to meet our obligations as they come due and fund our limited development plan for the next months  we continue to examine additional sources of long term capital  including a restructured debt facility  the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of preferred and common stock  the sales of non strategic assets  and joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  therefore  our ability to execute our operating strategy and meet our near term liquidity challenges  will depend upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control

these gains are recorded as an increase in revenues 
for the year ended december   all realized hedging gains are included in other income 
contract drilling and trucking fees 
at december  dhs owned drilling rigs with depth ratings of approximately  to  feet 
we have the right to use all of the rigs on a priority basis  although currently only two are working on delta operated wells 
drilling and trucking revenues for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the prior year period 
drilling and trucking revenues decreased in due to the average number of rigs working for delta from average rigs in compared to average rigs for the prior year 
drilling and trucking revenues earned on wells drilled for delta have been eliminated in consolidation 
production and cost information production volumes  average prices received and cost per equivalent mcf for the years ended december  and are as follows years ended december  production continuing operations oil mbbl gas mmcf production discontinued operations oil mbbl gas mmcf total production mmcfe average price continuing operations oil per barrel gas per mcf costs per mcfe continuing operations lease operating expense production taxes transportation costs depletion expense lease operating expense

during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment provision to our proved and unproved properties totaling approximately million primarily related to the newton  midway loop  opossum hollow and angleton fields in texas million  paradox field in utah million  howard ranch and bull canyon fields in the rockies million  utah hingeline million and our offshore california field million 
in addition  we recorded impairments to our paradox pipeline of million 
the impairments resulted primarily from the significant decline in commodity pricing during the fourth quarter of and unsuccessful drilling results 
during the year ended december   we recorded impairments totaling approximately million primarily related to the howard ranch and fuller fields in wyoming million and million  respectively  and the south angleton field in texas million  primarily due to lower rocky mountain natural gas prices and marginally economic deep zones on the howard ranch prospect 
depreciation  depletion and amortization oil and gas 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year earlier period 
depletion expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in depletion expense was due to a increase in production from continuing operations  slightly offset by a decrease in the depletion rate 
our depletion rate decreased to per mcfe for the year ended december  from per mcfe for the year earlier period 
the decrease is partially due to lower finding costs per mcfe on our rockies drilling program and the effect of impairments recorded in drilling and trucking operating expenses 
we had drilling and trucking operating expenses of million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the significant decrease in expenses was due to the increase in the average number of rigs working for delta in than in the prior year 
goodwill and drilling equipment impairments 
we performed our annual dhs goodwill impairment test during the quarter ended september   however  due to the deterioration in the market conditions and decreased utilization  we re evaluated the dhs goodwill and the fair values of our rigs as of december  we determined that the book value of the rigs was impaired by million 
as a result of the analysis performed at year end  we also wrote off the entire amount of dhs s goodwill of million 
depreciation and amortization drilling and trucking 
depreciation and amortization expense drilling and trucking decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year period 
this decrease can be attributed to a greater average number of rigs working for delta in compared to the prior year 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributed to an increase in staff and related personnel costs 
interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the comparable year earlier period 
the increase is primarily related to higher average debt balances on the delta and dhs credit facilities and the non cash accretion of discount on an installment obligation payable to encana oil and gas usa inc encana 

table of contents interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
the increase is primarily due to interest earned on our million restricted deposit in connection with a joint development transaction with encana and invested cash received from the tracinda transaction during the first quarter of other income and expense 
other expense for the year ended december  includes million of impairment charges related to our auction rate securities and million related to a forfeited deposit for a rig acquisition that dhs was unable to close due to lehman s failure to fund under the dhs credit facility 
realized gain on derivative instruments  net 
effective july   we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting 
beginning july   we recognize realized gains or losses in other income and expense instead of as a component of revenue 
as a result  other income and expense includes million and  of realized gains on derivative instruments for the years ended december  and  respectively 
unrealized gain on derivative instruments  net 
as a result of the discontinuation of cash flow hedge accounting  we recognize mark to market gains or losses in current earnings instead of deferring those amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income 
accordingly  we recognized million of unrealized gains on derivative instruments in other income and expense during the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the comparable prior year period  primarily due to lower commodity prices in the current year period

per diluted common share  for the year ended december  loss from continuing operations increased from million for the year ended december  to a loss of million for the year ended december   due primarily to dry hole costs and impairments  first half gains on undeveloped property sales and gains on ineffective derivative instruments that did not occur during  and due to higher depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense  and increased general and administrative expense in net loss increased significantly due to the valuation allowance required to be recorded against the company s deferred tax assets during the second quarter of oil and gas sales 
during the year ended december   oil and gas sales from continuing operations were million  as compared to million for the comparable period a year earlier 
during the year ended december   production from continuing operations increased by  however  this was offset by a 
table of contents decrease in the average gas price 
the average gas price received during the year ended december  was per mcf compared to per mcf for the year earlier period  primarily due to the increase in the basis differential applicable to rocky mountain natural gas 
the average oil price received during the year ended december  increased to per bbl compared to per bbl for the year earlier period 
net gains losses from effective hedging activities were a million gain and a million loss for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the gain in realized hedges is primarily due to lower oil and gas prices 
these gains losses are recorded as an increase or decrease in revenues 
contract drilling and trucking fees 
drilling revenues for the year ended december  remained flat at million compared to million for the prior year period 
drilling revenue is earned under daywork or turnkey contracts where we provide a drilling rig with required personnel to our third party customers who supervise the drilling of the well 
we are paid based on a negotiated fixed rate per day while the rig is in use or on a negotiated fixed rate for drilling to a certain depth 
during the mobilization period we typically earn a fixed amount of revenue based on the mobilization rate set in the contract 
drilling revenues earned on wells drilled for delta have been eliminated through consolidation 
trucking revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the prior year period

we acquired over  drilling locations on approximately  gross acres with a working interest 
the effective date of the transaction was march  the related agreement superseded a march agreement with encana and accordingly we have no further drilling commitment to encana under the march agreement 
in march  dhs acquired three rigs and spare equipment for a purchase price of million 
the transaction was funded by the proceeds from two notes payable issued by dhs to delta and chesapeake of million each and of proceeds of million each from delta and chesapeake for additional shares of common stock issued by dhs

cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
cash provided by financing activities was higher in primarily due to cash received in april from our convertible debt and equity offerings

sale of oil and gas properties on october   we divested our washington county  colorado assets in conjunction with an asset exchange transaction to acquire additional working interest in the garden gulch field in the piceance basin 
on september   we completed the sale of certain non core properties located in north dakota for cash consideration of approximately million 
the sale resulted in a gain of million

the transaction resulted in a gain on sale of properties of  
table of contents in march  we sold approximately of pgr for million 
this transaction involved both proved and unproved property interests and accordingly  to the extent the sale of pgr related to unproved properties  no gain was recognized as all of the unproved cost basis was not yet recovered 
we recorded a gain of million  million net of tax  and a million reduction to property during the first quarter of as a result of the transaction 
we have retained a interest in pgr 
during december  we transferred our ownership in approximately  gross acres  net acres of non operated interests in the columbia river basin to a newly created wholly owned subsidiary  crbp 
in january and march  we sold a combined minority interest in crbp for total proceeds of million 
as the sale involved unproved properties  no gain on the partial sale of crbp was recognized until all of the cost basis of crbp has been recovered 
accordingly  we recorded a million gain  million net of tax and an million reduction to property during the first quarter of upon closing the transaction

amounts due will be funded with restricted cash deposits on hand 
the company has no significant drilling commitments  other than to drill one well on a gulf coast property by july  if we do not commence drilling by july   the leasehold interest we acquired for million reverts to the previous owner 
credit facility on november   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with jp morgan chase bank  na and certain other financial institutions  which  among other changes  increased the amount of our revolving credit facility up to million subject to borrowing base limitations 
as of december  the borrowing base under our revised facility was million with an outstanding balance of million 
borrowings under the amended credit agreement are available to finance the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas interests and related assets and activities  refinance certain existing debt and provide for working capital and general corporate purposes 
we were required to meet certain financial covenants for the quarter ended december  including a current ratio of greater than to and consolidated net debt to consolidated ebitdax as defined in the amended credit agreement for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters of less than to for the period ending december  at december   we were in compliance with our maximum debt to ebitdax ratio but did not meet our minimum current ratio and accounts payable covenants and accordingly we have classified the million of debt outstanding under the bank credit facility at december  as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
on march   we entered into the first amendment to our second amended and restated credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na and certain other financial institutions in which  among other changes  the lenders provided us a forbearance period from acting upon their rights as a result of our violation of accounts payable and current ratio covenants for a period ending april  at the earliest and no later than june  dependent upon the progress of our capital raising efforts 
the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility waives our covenant violations existing at december   waives the march  current ratio covenant requirement and replaces the previous consolidated net debt to consolidated ebitdax covenant with a senior secured debt to consolidated ebitdax requirement for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters to be less than to beginning december  the borrowing base under the credit facility has been reduced from million to million  with a conforming borrowing base of million until the next redetermination date september  
the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility requires that we raise net proceeds of at least million through our capital raising efforts on or before the forbearance termination date and that we reduce our amounts outstanding under the facility to not more than million and pay accounts payable with such net proceeds 
the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility revised the variable interest rates payable under the credit facility based on the ratio of outstanding credit to the conforming borrowing base to vary between libor plus to libor plus for eurodollar loans and to for base rate loans 
the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility changes the maturity date of the credit facility to january  upon the successful completion of our capital raising efforts 
in addition  the forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility requires us to put derivative contracts in place to establish a floor price for our anticipated production of a minimum of for the last two quarters of  for the calendar year and for the calendar year as a result of capital raising efforts and the amendment to the agreement  we project we will meet our covenant requirements during however  because our operations are subject to a number of risks beyond management s control  including but not limited to  commodity price declines and third party production curtailment  there can be no assurance that we will in fact meet our covenant requirements 
if such an event of default were to occur  the lenders would be entitled to accelerate our outstanding debt in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement 
the borrowing base is re determined by the lending banks at least semi annually on april and september of each year  or by special re determinations if requested by the company based on drilling success 
if  as a result of any reduction in the amount of our borrowing base  the total amount of the outstanding debt were to exceed the amount of the borrowing base in effect  then  within days after we are notified of the borrowing base deficiency  we would be required to make a mandatory payment of principal to reduce our outstanding indebtedness so that it would not exceed our borrowing base  to eliminate the deficiency by making three equal monthly principal payments  within days  to provide additional collateral for consideration to eliminate the deficiency or to eliminate the deficiency through a combination of through 
if for any reason we were unable to pay the full amount of the mandatory prepayment within the requisite day period  we would be in default of our obligations under our credit facility 
subsequent to year end  the borrowing base under our credit facility will be reduced upon the successful completion of our capital raising efforts to million  which will require a repayment of million based on outstanding borrowings of million at march  the credit facility includes terms and covenants that place limitations on certain types of activities  including restrictions or requirements with respect to additional debt  liens  asset sales  hedging activities  investments  dividends  mergers and acquisitions  and includes financial covenants 
under certain conditions  amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be accelerated 
bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to us or certain of our subsidiaries will result in an automatic acceleration of the indebtedness under the credit facility 
subject to notice and cure periods in certain cases  other events of default under the credit facility will result in acceleration of the indebtedness at the option of the lending banks 
such other events of default include non payment  breach of warranty  non performance of obligations under the credit facility including financial covenants  default on other indebtedness  certain pension plan events  certain adverse judgments  change of control  and a failure of the liens securing the credit facility 
this facility is secured by a first and prior lien to the lending banks on most of our oil and gas properties  certain related equipment  oil and gas inventory  and certain bank accounts and proceeds 
installments payable on property acquisition on february   we closed a transaction with encana to jointly develop a portion of encana s leasehold interests in the vega area of the piceance basin 
under the terms of the agreement we have committed to fund million  of which million was paid at the closing and installments of million  million  and million are payable november    and  respectively 
these remaining installments are collateralized by a letter of credit  which in turn is collateralized by cash on deposit in a restricted account 
the installment payment obligation is recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as current and long term liabilities at a discounted value  initially of million  based on an imputed interest rate of 
the discount is being accreted on the effective interest method over the term of the installments  including accretion of million for the year ended december  senior unsecured notes  due on march   we issued senior unsecured notes for an aggregate amount of million which pay interest semi annually on april and october and mature in the notes were issued at of par and the associated discount is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes 
the indenture governing the notes contains various restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  make certain investments  sell assets  consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our restricted subsidiaries 
these covenants may limit management s discretion in operating our business 

table of contents senior convertible notes  due on april   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due the notes for net proceeds of million after underwriters discounts and commissions of approximately million 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears  on may and november of each year  beginning november  the notes will mature on may  unless earlier converted  redeemed or repurchased 
the notes will be convertible at the holder s option  in whole or in part  at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the final maturity date of the notes  subject to prior repurchase of the notes 
the conversion rate may be adjusted from time to time in certain instances 
upon conversion of a note  we will have the option to deliver shares of our common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock for the notes surrendered 
in addition  following certain fundamental changes that occur prior to maturity  we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such fundamental changes by a number of additional shares of common stock 
although the notes do not contain any financial covenants  the notes contain covenants that require us to properly make payments of principal and interest  provide certain reports  certificates and notices to the trustee under various circumstances  cause our wholly owned subsidiaries to become guarantors of the debt  maintain an office or agency where the notes may be presented or surrendered for payment  continue our corporate existence  pay taxes and other claims  and not seek protection from the debt under any applicable usury laws 

table of contents credit facility dhs on august   dhs entered into a new agreement with lehman commercial paper to amend the december  lehman credit facility 
the revised agreement increased the borrowing base from million to million 
the lehman credit facility has a variable interest rate based on day libor plus a fixed margin of  which approximated as of december  on the first million term a  and a variable interest rate of day libor plus a fixed margin of on the second million term b  which approximated as of december  quarterly principal payments are required beginning april  the note matures on august  although dhs has million remaining available under its revised credit facility with lehman  such amounts are not anticipated to be available due to lehman s bankruptcy and failure to fund prior draw requests on the facility 
annual principal payments are based upon a calculation of excess cash flow as defined for the preceding year 
the first quarterly principal payment is due on april  dhs is required to meet certain quarterly financial covenants including maintaining i a leverage ratio as defined not to exceed to for the term of the loan  ii interest coverage ratio as defined to be greater than to for the term of the loan  iii minimum ebitda amount of million is required for twelve month periods ending prior to march   million for periods ending prior to october   and for periods ending after october   the greater of million plus the product of million times the number of additional rigs purchased with proceeds from the term b loan  and iv the current ratio for any fiscal quarters must be greater than to dhs incurred  of financing charges in conjunction with the revised agreement although a portion was written off in the 
table of contents fourth quarter due to lehman s failure to fund additional borrowing requests 
the remaining financing costs are being amortized over the term of the loan 
at december   dhs was in compliance with its quarterly debt covenants and restrictions under the facility 
other contractual obligations our asset retirement obligation arises from the costs necessary to plug and abandon our oil and gas wells 
the majority of this obligation will not occur during the next five years 
we lease our corporate office in denver  colorado under an operating lease which will expire in our average yearly payments approximate million over the term of the lease 
we have additional operating lease commitments which represent office equipment leases and lease obligations primarily relating to field vehicles and equipment 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations were based on the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas reserves  bad debts  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes  derivatives  contingencies and litigation  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
successful efforts method of accounting we account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for gas and oil leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
the sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit of production amortization rate 
a gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of producing properties 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze  and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver gas and oil in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature  and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
delineation seismic costs incurred to select development locations within an oil and gas field are typically considered development costs and are capitalized  but often these seismic programs extend beyond the reserve area considered proved  and management must estimate the portion of the seismic costs to expense 
the evaluation of gas and oil leasehold acquisition costs requires managerial judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 

table of contents the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when we are entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding a gas and oil field that will be the focus of future development drilling activity 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed 
seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred 
reserve estimates estimates of gas and oil reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas and oil that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable gas and oil reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future gas and oil prices  the availability and cost of capital to develop the reserves  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover gas costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to an extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of gas and oil attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our gas and oil properties and or the rate of depletion of the gas and oil properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
with the further decline in commodity pricing since year end  the proved undeveloped reserves attributable to our piceance basin properties are uneconomic using the spot natural gas price as of february  the piceance basin properties contain nearly all of our proved undeveloped reserves 
further development of these properties depends on expected higher commodity prices in the future  reductions in future drilling costs  or a combination of both 
impairment of gas and oil properties we review our oil and gas properties for impairment quarterly or whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
we estimate the expected future cash flows of our developed proved properties and compare such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the proved properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to their fair value 
the primary factors used to determine fair value include estimates of proved reserves  future production estimates  future commodity pricing  anticipated capital expenditures and production costs  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
given the complexities associated with gas and oil reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the gas and oil markets  events may arise that would require us to record an impairment of the recorded book values associated with gas and oil properties 
for developed properties  the review consists of a comparison of the carrying value of the asset with the asset s expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest costs 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded an impairment provision to our proved and unproved properties for the year ended december  totaling approximately million primarily related to the newton  midway loop  opossum hollow and angleton fields in texas million  paradox field in utah million  howard ranch and bull canyon fields in the rockies million  utah hingeline million and our offshore california field million 
the impairments resulted primarily due to the significant decline in commodity pricing during the fourth quarter of during the year ended december   an impairment of million was recorded primarily related to the howard ranch and fuller fields in wyoming million and million  respectively  and the south angleton field in texas million  primarily due to lower rocky mountain natural gas prices and marginally economic deep zones on the howard ranch prospect 
during the year ended december   an impairment of million was recorded on certain of the company s eastern colorado properties primarily due to lower rocky 
table of contents mountain natural gas prices 
in addition  an impairment of million was recorded on certain oklahoma properties 
for fiscal year  we are continuing to develop and evaluate certain proved and unproved properties on which favorable or unfavorable results or commodity prices may cause us to revise in future quarters our estimates of those properties future cash flows 
such revisions of estimates could require us to record an impairment in the period of such revisions 
commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities we may periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts or fixed price physical contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
we primarily utilize futures contracts  swaps or options  which are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counterparties of high credit quality that we believe are minimal credit risks 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value which must be estimated using complex valuation models 
effective july   we elected to discontinue cash flow hedge accounting prospectively 
beginning july   we recognize mark to market gains and losses in current earnings instead of deferring those amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of december   we had no outstanding derivative contracts 
however  in accordance with the terms of our forbearance agreement and amendment to the credit facility  we expect to put derivative contracts in place to establish a floor price for our anticipated production of a minimum of for the last two quarters of  for the calendar year and for the calendar year asset retirement obligation we account for our asset retirement obligations under sfas sfas requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for retirement obligations of acquired assets 
our asset retirement obligations arise from the plugging and abandonment liabilities for our oil and gas wells 
the fair value is estimated based on a variety of assumptions including discount and inflation rates and estimated costs and timing to plug and abandon wells 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we follow sfas to account for our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
ultimately  realization of a deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback carryforward period to absorb future deductible temporary differences or a carryforward 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management must consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers all available evidence both positive and negative in determining whether a valuation allowance is required 
such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment  and judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence 
as a result of management s current assessment  we maintain a significant valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor facts and circumstances in our reassessment of the likelihood that operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes will be utilized prior to their expiration 
as a result  we may determine that the deferred tax asset valuation allowance should be increased or decreased 
such changes would impact net income through offsetting changes in income tax expense or benefit 
recently issued accounting standards and pronouncements in march  the fasb affirmed fasb staff position fsp apb a  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
the fsp requires the proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt instruments to be allocated between a liability component debt issued at a discount and an equity component 
the resulting debt discount is amortized over the period the convertible debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
the fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   or our first quarter this fsp changes the accounting treatment for our senior convertible notes since it is to be applied retrospectively upon adoption 
based on our stock price on the date of the original issuance  the terms of the notes  and other inputs  the liability component of the issuance was approximately million and the equity component was approximately million 
based on these 
table of contents components at the issue date we will record accretion of debt discount for and of approximately million and million  respectively  and a reduction to the carrying value of the notes of million upon the adoption of the fsp

revised  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any resulting goodwill  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides for disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   or our fiscal year  and must be applied prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests minority interests in subsidiaries 
sfas clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be accounted for as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   or fiscal year  and must be applied prospectively  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which will apply retrospectively 
we adopted the provisions of sfas on january  beginning with our first quarter reporting period and for prior comparative periods  we will present noncontrolling interests  currently referred to as minority interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as a component of stockholders equity 
the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  however  it could impact our accounting for future transactions 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   or fiscal year we adopted sfas effective january   but did not elect to apply the sfas fair value option to eligible assets and liabilities during the year ended december  in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas aims to improve the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements by creating a single definition of fair value 
the statement emphasizes that fair value is not entity specific but instead is a market based measurement of an asset or liability 
sfas reaffirms the requirements of previously issued pronouncements concerning fair value measurements and expands the required disclosures 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fsp no 
delays the effective date of sfas for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we adopted the provisions of sfas for fair value measurements not delayed by fsp no 
the adoption resulted in additional disclosures as required by the pronouncement related to our fair value measurements for oil and gas derivatives and marketable securities  but did not change our fair value calculation methodologies 
accordingly  the adoption had no impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market rate and price risk we  at times  actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging meaningful portions of our expected production through the use of derivatives  including costless collars  swaps  and puts 
the level of our hedging activity and the duration of the instruments employed depend upon our view of market conditions  available hedge prices and our operating strategy 
we use hedges to limit the risk of fluctuating cash flows that fund our capital expenditure program 
we also may use hedges in conjunction with acquisitions to achieve expected economic returns during the payout period 
at december   we had no outstanding derivative agreements 
assuming production and the percent of oil and gas sold remained unchanged from the year ended december   a hypothetical decline in the average market price we realized during the year ended december  on unhedged production would reduce our oil and natural gas revenues by approximately million on an annual basis 
interest rate risk we were subject to interest rate risk on million of variable rate debt obligations at december  the annual effect of a change in interest rates would be approximately million 
the interest rate on these variable debt obligations approximates current market rates as of december  as of december   we have fixed rate debt totaling million 
the fair value of the fixed rate debt as of december  was approximately million
