executive overview fiscal proved to be one of the most challenging periods in our fifty four year history 
weakness and severe tightening in the overall credit markets  economic downturns in local  national and global economies  continued deterioration in the california real estate market and weakness in certain of our california commercial construction and hawaii residential construction borrowers contributed to a net loss of million recognized for the year 
the net loss recognized in was attributable to million in provision for loan and lease losses and a million goodwill impairment charge  as continued weakness in our california residential construction loan portfolio negatively impacted results 
our results for were reflective of the challenging and unprecedented economic environment that financial institutions across the country continue to experience 
despite the current turmoil and uncertainty in the financial markets  we remain committed to investing in our core hawaii franchise and improving our asset quality 
business environment the global and us economies are currently experiencing a continued slowdown in business activity as a result of disruptions in the financial system  including a freeze and lack of confidence in the worldwide credit markets 
in the us  credit conditions have worsened considerably over the course of the year and the us officially entered into a recession as announced by the national bureau of economic research 
falling home prices  as well as increased foreclosures and unemployment rates during the past year have resulted in significant write downs of asset values 
these write downs have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
as a result of the current uncertainties regarding the stability of the financial markets  many financial institutions have reduced and or ceased to provide funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
accordingly  the availability of credit  confidence in the financial sector  and level of volatility in the financial markets have been adversely affected and have contributed to the recent volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets which have reached unprecedented levels 
in response to the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets  the eesa was signed into law on october  under the eesa  the us treasury was granted the authority to purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the us treasury announced that it will purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts under the tarp s cpp 
under the cpp  the us treasury made billion of capital available to us financial institutions in the form of preferred stock 
in conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock  the us treasury will receive warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the preferred stock investment 
participating financial institutions will also be required to adopt the us treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the us treasury holds equity issued under the cpp 
during  the fed announced a number of initiatives to provide stability and additional liquidity to the financial markets 
these initiatives include providing additional liquidity to the asset backed commercial paper and money markets and planned purchases of short term debt obligations issued by fannie mae  freddie mac and the federal home loan banks 
in december  the fed lowered the federal funds benchmark rate to a range of zero to and the discount rate to the majority of our operations are concentrated in the states of hawaii and california 
accordingly  our business performance is directly affected by conditions in the banking industry  macro economic conditions and the real estate market in those states 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by expanding gross state product  low unemployment and rising personal income while an unfavorable business environment is characterized by declining gross state product  high unemployment and declining personal income 
general economic conditions in hawaii slowed throughout with signs of diminished growth appearing in the latter part of tourism remains hawaii s most significant economic driver  and according to the hawaii department of business economic development tourism dbedt  million visitors visited the state in this was a decrease of from the number of visitor arrivals in and according to the dbedt  total visitor arrivals are expected to further decline by in the dbedt also reported that total visitor spending declined to billion in from a record billion in the department of labor and industrial relations reported that hawaii s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was in december  compared to in december despite the increase  hawaii s unemployment rate remained below the national seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 
dbedt projects real personal income to decline by approximately in  with increases in real personal income of and in and  respectively 
dbedt also projects real gross state product growth to remain unchanged in with real estate lending as a primary focus  including construction  residential mortgage and commercial mortgage loans  we are dependent on the strength of the real estate market 
the hawaii real estate market cooled in and  according to the honolulu board of realtors  oahu unit sales volume dropped for single family homes and for condominiums in from median sales prices in for single family homes on oahu was  representing a decrease from the prior year  while median sales prices for condominiums remained unchanged at  expectations from local economists are for the hawaii real estate market to continue its slowdown in with projected declines in both unit sales volume and median prices of 
the effects of falling home prices  limited credit availability  shrinking equity values and growing unemployment stymied the california economy in as it decelerated in step with the national economy 
consumer and business spending  the core of the california economy  decreased in the outlook for the california economy calls for negative growth in  followed by weak growth in improving slightly in the california association of realtors car reported that december unit home sales increased by  while the median price plunged from year ago levels primarily driven by a significant rise in distressed sales  including foreclosures 
car forecasts calfornia median sales price will decline to  in  while the number of sales are projected to increase by during the same period as distressed sales will continue to impact the market 
according to the california department of finance cdof  average personal income is projected to have increased by in from one year ago and projections for call for an increase of from the cdof also reported that california civilian workforce grew by to million in december from million a year ago  while california s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in december increased to from in the prior year and continues to be well above the national unemployment rate 
our results of operations in future periods will be significantly impacted by the economies in hawaii  california or other markets we serve 
loan demand  deposit growth  provision for loan and lease losses  asset quality  noninterest income and noninterest expense may be affected by changes in economic conditions 
if the california and hawaii residential real estate markets do not improve or continue to deteriorate  the california and hawaii commercial real estate market worsens  or the economic environments in hawaii  california or other markets we serve suffer an adverse change or a material external shock  our results of operations may be negatively impacted 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that management make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosures made 
accounting estimates are deemed critical when a different estimate could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and would materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of or for the periods presented 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates noted below with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the accompanying disclosures 
allowance for loan and lease losses we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance at an amount we expect to be sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio based on a projection of probable net loan charge offs 
for loans classified as impaired  an estimated impairment loss is calculated 
to estimate loan charge offs on other loans  we evaluate the level and trend of nonperforming and potential problem loans and historical loss experience 
we also consider other relevant economic conditions and borrower specific risk characteristics  including current repayment patterns of our borrowers  the fair value of collateral securing specific loans  changes in our lending and underwriting standards and general economic factors  nationally and in the markets we serve  including the real estate market generally and the residential construction market 
estimated loss rates are determined by loan category and risk profile  and an overall required allowance is calculated 
based on our estimate of the level of allowance required  a provision for loan and lease losses the provision is recorded to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level 
we adjusted our provision in and in accordance with our risk assessment policies to account for an increase in exposure throughout various portions of our loan portfolio 
reserves for unfunded commitments are recorded separately through a valuation allowance included in other liabilities 
credit losses for off balance sheet credit exposures are deducted from the allowance for credit losses on off balance sheet credit exposures in the period in which the liability is settled 
the allowance for credit losses on off balance sheet credit losses is established by a charge to other operating expense 
since we cannot predict with certainty the amount of loan and lease charge offs that will be incurred and because the eventual level of loan and lease charge offs are impacted by numerous conditions beyond our control  a range of loss estimates could reasonably have been used to determine the allowance and provision 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review our allowance 
such agencies may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates 
further deterioration in the california or hawaii real estate markets could result in an increase in loan delinquencies  additional increases in our allowance and provision  as well as an increase in loan charge offs 
loans held for sale loans held for sale consists of hawaii residential mortgage loans  as well as mainland residential and commercial construction loans 
hawaii residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value on an aggregate basis while mainland residential and commercial construction loans are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value on an individual basis 
loans originated with the intent to be held in our portfolio are subsequently transferred to held for sale when a decision is made to sell these loans 
at the time of a loan s transfer to the held for sale account  the loan is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value 
any reduction in the loan s value is reflected as a write down of the recorded investment resulting in a new cost basis  with a corresponding reduction in the allowance 
in subsequent periods  if the fair value of a loan classified as held for sale is less than its cost basis  a valuation adjustment is recognized in our consolidated statement of operations in other operating expense and the carrying value of the loan is adjusted accordingly 
the valuation adjustment may be recovered in the event that the fair value increases  which is also recognized in our consolidated statement of operations in other operating expense 
the fair value of loans classified as held for sale are generally based upon quoted prices for similar assets in active markets  acceptance of firm offer letters with agreed upon purchase prices  discounted cash flow models that take into account market observable assumptions  or independent appraisals of the underlying collateral securing the loans 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we review the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
additionally  we perform an impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable 
significant negative industry or economic trends  disruptions to our business  unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets  divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill 
absent any impairment indicators  we perform our goodwill impairment test annually 
our impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets involves the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of reporting units to which goodwill is allocated 
we reconcile the estimated fair values of our reporting units to our total market capitalization plus a control premium 
estimating future cash flows and determining fair values of the reporting units is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of the impairment charge 
in the second quarter of and fourth quarter of  we experienced significant declines in our market capitalization which we determined were indicators that impairment tests were required under sfas as a result of our impairment tests at june  and december   we determined that the goodwill associated with our commercial real estate reporting unit  which includes the california residential construction loan portfolio  was impaired and we consequently recorded non cash charges of million and million in the second quarter of and fourth quarter of  respectively 
the goodwill associated with our hawaii market reporting unit was not considered to be impaired at any of these periods 
in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a further decline in our market capitalization due to the continued deterioration of the california real estate market  however  no goodwill impairment charge was recognized as there was no goodwill remaining in our commercial real estate reporting segment and no impairment was identified in our hawaii market reporting segment 
all remaining goodwill at december  is attributable to our hawaii market reporting unit 
future declines in our market capitalization may result in the impairment of the remaining goodwill assigned to our hawaii market reporting unit 
the reconciliation of fair value estimates of the reporting units to our total market capitalization in the second quarter of and fourth quarter of included implied control premiums of and  respectively 
we considered recent trends in our market capitalization and compared these implied control premiums to observable transaction premiums for other financial institutions from publicly available data sources and concluded that they were reasonable at each period end 
deferred tax assets and tax contingencies we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
a valuation allowance may be required if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary  we consider the level of taxable income in prior years  to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws  as well as estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies that could be implemented to accelerate taxable income if necessary 
if our estimates of future taxable income were materially overstated or if our assumptions regarding the tax consequences of tax planning strategies were inaccurate  some or all of our deferred tax assets may not be realized  which would result in a charge to earnings 
we have established income tax contingency reserves for potential tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions 
tax benefits are recognized when we determine that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized 
where uncertainty exists due to the complexity of income tax statutes and where the potential tax amounts are significant  we generally seek independent tax opinions to support our positions 
if our evaluation of the likelihood of the realization of benefits is inaccurate  we could incur additional income tax and interest expense that would adversely impact earnings  or we could receive tax benefits greater than anticipated which would positively impact earnings 
defined benefit retirement plan defined benefit plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the defined benefit retirement plan was curtailed and all plan benefits were fixed as of that date 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt securities  are typically valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize a yield that reflects the top of the universe of bonds  ranked in the order of the highest yield 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
at december   we used a weighted average discount rate of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  which affected the amount of pension liability recorded as of year end and the amount of pension expense to be recorded in at december   a weighted average discount rate of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of were used in determining the pension liability recorded as of year end and the amount of pension expense recorded in for both the discount rate and the asset return rate  a range of estimates could reasonably have been used which would affect the amount of pension expense and pension liability recorded 
an increase in the discount rate or asset return rate would reduce pension expense in  while a decrease in the discount rate or asset return rate would have the opposite effect 
a change in the discount rate assumption would impact pension expense by million and year end pension liability by million  while a change in the asset return rate would impact pension expense by less than million 
overview of results of operations vs 
comparison in  we recognized a net loss of million compared to net income of million in the net loss recognized in was primarily driven by an increase in credit costs and the write off of the remaining goodwill assigned to our commercial real estate reporting segment as continued weakness in the california residential construction market persisted throughout the year

in  the provision for loan and lease losses was million and there was no goodwill impairment 
partially offsetting the negative effects of the increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and the goodwill impairment charge was the decrease in income tax expense as there was a disproportionate recognition of federal and state tax credits compared to our taxable income 
the company earns a tax benefit from tax credits and tax exempt income irrespective of the level of pre tax income

net interest income expressed on a taxable equivalent basis  totaled million in  decreasing by million  or  from million in  which increased by million  or  over net interest income of million recognized in the decrease in net interest income for was reflective of the declining interest rate environment in as the bp decrease in average yields earned on our interest earning assets outpaced the bp decrease in average rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
interest income our primary sources of interest income include interest on loans and leases  which represented   and of interest income in  and  respectively  as well as interest earned on investment securities  which represented  and of interest income in  and  respectively 
interest income expressed on a taxable equivalent basis of million in decreased by million  or  from the million earned in  which increased by million  or  from the million earned in as depicted in table  the decrease in interest income in is largely due to the decrease in average yields on our loan balances  which declined by bp from the prior year 
the decline in interest income due to rate changes is reflective of the declining interest rate environment that existed throughout most of the decrease in interest income in was also negatively impacted by the reversal of approximately million in interest related to certain nonaccrual loans 
as depicted in table  the increase in interest income in is due primarily to the increase in average loan and lease balances 
average interest earning assets of billion in increased by million  or  over due largely to an increase of million  or  in average loans and leases as loan demand remained relatively strong through most of the average yield on interest earning assets of in increased by bp over the average yield of  with loan and lease yields increasing by only bp as variable rate loans began to reprice downward in mid comparing results to those of  the increase in interest income can be attributed to the million  or  increase in average loans and leases and  to a lesser extent  the increase in average yields on interest earning assets which increased by bp to in loan and lease growth in was reflective of strong demand that persisted through most of interest expense interest expense  expressed on a taxable equivalent basis  of million in decreased by million  or  compared to million in  which increased by million  or  compared to million in declines in average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities reflect the decreasing interest rate environment experienced in and contributed to the overall reduction in interest expense during the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased by bp to for  compared to in decreases in average rates paid on time deposits  and over of basis points  long term debt of basis points  savings and money market deposits of basis points and short term borrowings of basis points were primary drivers to the overall decrease in interest expense 
partially offsetting the effects of the decrease in average rates was the increase in total interest bearing liabilities  which increased by million  or  over the prior year as we sought to capitalize on attractive short term borrowing rates that were available in in  average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  or  to billion  including increases of million in average interest bearing deposits and million in average long term debt  while average short term borrowings decrease by million 
the average rate on interest bearing liabilities increased by bp due primarily to a bp increase in rates paid on interest bearing deposits 
competitive pricing in the hawaii market  coupled with the migration in customer accounts from demand and savings and money market accounts to time deposits  resulted in higher funding costs in net interest margin our net interest margin was  and in  and  respectively 
the decline in our net interest margin in both and can be attributed to the differences in timing of rate movements in our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in  downward repricing of our variable rate loan portfolio outpaced deposit repricings 
in  increases in average yields on our interest earning assets fell short of increases in average rates on our interest bearing liabilities 
our net interest margin for was also negatively impacted by the aforementioned reversal of interest related to certain nonaccrual loans 
based on our expectation of slightly declining loan levels and interest rate movements in  we anticipate moderate declines in both asset yields and deposit rates 
accordingly  we anticipate that our net interest margin will remain at current levels or decrease slightly during the coming year 
our ability to generate continued growth in loans  which typically bring higher yields than other interest earning assets  our ability to fund that asset growth with relatively low cost core deposits and competitive pricing factors will directly impact our anticipated future net interest margins and net interest income

net gains on sales of residential loans increased by million  or  from the prior year as our central pacific homeloans subsidiary continued to experience growth in both loan originations and refinancing activity in investment securities gains losses increased by million over the prior year primarily due to a million loss recognized in on the repositioning of our investment portfolio as we sought to reduce net interest income volatility 
in  income from bank owned life insurance increased by million  or  due to an additional million purchase of life insurance policies and certain death benefits received during the period 
other service charges and fees increased by million  or  over prior year amounts primarily due to increases in investment service fees of and charge card fees of from income from our trust services has shown continued growth in the past few years as income from fiduciary activities increased by million  or  from the prior year

other operating expenses in also included a million non cash mortgage servicing rights impairment charge as delinquency rate assumptions increased and prepayment speed assumptions accelerated driven by the surge in refinance activity as the fed s attempted to drive down mortgage rates during the latter part of the increase in salaries and employee benefits in was primarily attributable to million of executive retirement expenses incurred during the year as well as an increase of million in incentive compensation 
in  we also recognized a loss of million resulting from a counterparty repurchase transaction with lbi

for  we expect fdic premiums  which are recorded in other operating expenses  to more than double the million in insurance expense incurred in the fdic has raised insurance premiums to cover substantial losses incurred by its bank insurance fund due to the rise in bank failures in and anticipated bank failures in future periods 
fdic insurance expenses are projected to remain high for several years 
excluding the effects of the goodwill impairment charge recognized in  other operating expenses in decreased from the prior year primarily due to the reduction of salaries and employee benefits of million  or  from the prior year 
the decrease in salaries and employee benefits is attributed to a reduction in certain bonus and incentive compensation accruals  as well as the recognition of million in executive retirement expenses in the decrease in salaries and employee benefits was partially offset by an increase in other expenses of million  or  as we increased our reserve for unfunded commitments by approximately million in to cover credit risks primarily associated with our california residential construction loan portfolio 
a key measure of operating efficiency tracked by management is the efficiency ratio

we recorded net reductions in taxes of approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively  attributable to high technology and energy tax credits 
the state s high technology tax credit program offers tax credits for investments in high technology companies at diminishing levels over a year period 
during the fourth quarter of  we also recognized federal and state tax credits related to solar leases with an after tax benefit of million

loan portfolio we focus our lending activities on commercial  commercial mortgage and construction loans to small and middle market companies  business professionals and real estate developers 
our strategy for generating new loans relies upon teams of commercial real estate and commercial banking officers organized by geographical and industry lines who are responsible for client prospecting and business development 
to manage credit risk ie  the inability of borrowers to repay their loan obligations  management analyzes the borrower s financial condition  repayment source  collateral and other factors that could impact credit quality  such as national and local economic conditions and industry conditions related to respective borrowers 
loans and leases totaled billion at december   decreasing by million  or  from the billion at year end  which increased by million  or  over the billion held at year end the decrease in our loan portfolio in was representative of our concerted effort to reduce our exposure to the slumping real estate market in california 
in  our construction loan portfolio contracted by million  or  from the prior year and included the sale of certain non performing assets with exposure to the california residential construction market 
in an effort to reduce our exposure to the troubled california residential construction sector  we completed a bulk sale of loans with exposure to this sector in july for total proceeds of million 
our consumer and commercial mortgage portfolios also contracted by million  or  and million  or  respectively  from prior year levels 
partially offsetting these decreases was the million  or  growth in residential mortgages as our subsidiary  central pacific homeloans  continued to gain market share in the residential mortgage market in hawaii 
while our loan portfolio has contracted over the past year  we note that our participation in the tarp s cpp provides us with additional resources for our lending activities to support our commercial and retail customers in hawaii

the borrower s business is typically regarded as the principal source of repayment  although our underwriting policy and practice generally requires additional sources of collateral  including real estate and other business assets  as well as personal guarantees where possible to mitigate risk 
risks of credit losses are greater in this loan category relative to secured loans  such as commercial and residential mortgages  where a greater percentage of the loan amount is usually covered by collateral 
nonetheless  any collateral or personal guarantees obtained on commercial loans can mitigate the increased risk and help to reduce credit losses 
our approach to commercial lending involves teams of lending and cash management personnel who focus on marketing loans  deposits and other bank services to new and existing commercial clients 
sustained long term growth in this loan category will be dependent upon local economic conditions  interest rate levels  competitive market conditions and other external factors 
real estate construction construction loans offered include both residential and commercial development projects 
each construction project is evaluated for economic viability and maximum loan to value ratios of on commercial projects and on residential projects are generally required 
a construction loan poses higher credit risks than typical secured loans 
in addition to the financial strength of the borrower  construction loans have the added element of completion risk  which is the risk that the project will not be completed on time and within budget  resulting in additional costs that could affect the economic viability of the project 
careful consideration of the ability and reputation of the developer and close monitoring of a project during the construction phase by construction lending specialists is required to mitigate the higher level of risk in construction lending 
the increase in our construction loan portfolio from through is representative of our historic focus on this segment and a real estate market that had been strong with increased development activity in all of our markets until recently 
in the second half of  some of our residential construction loans in california began exhibited heightened levels of risk with some borrowers abandoning their construction plans and defaulting on their loans due to a range of factors including declining real estate values 
as mentioned previously  in an effort to reduce our exposure to this sector  we sold a portion of our california residential construction loan portfolio 
the significant deterioration in this market persisted throughout construction loans tend to be larger in amount and shorter in term than conventional commercial or mortgage loans  thus a higher level of volatility in balances from year to year is expected 
we anticipate future decreases in our construction loan portfolio as many projects are expected to be completed 
real estate mortgage table sets forth information with respect to the composition of the real estate mortgage loan portfolio as of the dates indicated 
table mortgage loan portfolio composition december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands residential units or more units commercial  industrial and other total residential residential mortgage loans include both fixed and adjustable rate loans primarily secured by single family owner occupied residences 
maximum loan to value ratios of are typically required  although higher levels are permitted with accompanying mortgage insurance 
we emphasize residential mortgage loans for owner occupied primary residences and typically do not actively seek loans on high end residences  vacation homes and investment properties 
first mortgage loans secured by residential properties generally carry a moderate level of credit risk 
with an average loan size of approximately million  readily marketable collateral and a hawaii residential real estate market that has been relatively stable until recently  credit losses on residential mortgages have been minimal during the past several years 
however  future changes in interest rates and other market factors can impact the marketability of collateral and thus the level of credit risk inherent in the portfolio 
as with all loans  managing credit risk in the residential mortgage market entails strong underwriting standards and diligent monitoring and handling of problems as they arise 
residential mortgage loan balances as of december  totaled billion  increasing by million  or  over the billion at year end  which increased by million  or  over the million held at year end residential mortgage originations remained strong throughout most of and an expected rise in refinancing activity  driven by the fed s actions to lower mortgage rates  fueled additional residential mortgage activity during the latter part of december substantially all saleable fixed rate mortgages are sold in the secondary market 
residential mortgage loans held for sale at december  totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from the december  balance of million  which increased by million  or  over the december  balance of million 
in  we also securitized certain residential mortgage loans with an outstanding principal balance of million with a us government sponsored entity 
the projected cooling of the hawaii residential real estate market in is expected to have a moderating effect on origination activity  while increased refinance activity is expected as mortgage rates remain near historical lows 
commercial real estate mortgage loans secured by commercial properties continues to represent the single largest component of our loan portfolio 
our policy with respect to commercial mortgages is that loans be made for sound purposes  have a definite source and or plan of repayment established at inception  and be backed up by reliable secondary sources of repayment and satisfactory collateral with good marketability 
loans secured by commercial property carry a greater risk than loans secured by residential property due to operating income risk 
operating income risk is the risk that the borrower will be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from the operation of the property 
the commercial real estate market and interest rate conditions through economic cycles will impact risk levels 
to mitigate the risks inherent in commercial mortgage lending  we strive to use dedicated  experienced commercial mortgage lenders to underwrite  monitor and service commercial mortgage loans 
nevertheless  commercial mortgage lending generated by our california offices exposes us to certain additional risks including the risk of continued economic downturn in the california market 
the commercial real estate market has not experienced quite the level of slowdown as evidenced in the us residential real estate market  however  there can be no assurances that a significant slowdown will not occur in this sector 
we expect loan demand to decline in as a result of changes in market conditions 
consumer loans table sets forth the major components of our consumer loan portfolio as of the dates indicated 
table consumer loan portfolio composition december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands automobile credit cards and other revolving credit plans other total for consumer loans  credit risk is managed on a pooled basis 
considerations include an evaluation of the quality  character and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions and past loan loss experience 
consumer loans represent a moderate credit risk 
loans in this category are generally either unsecured or secured by personal assets such as automobiles 
we do not have any credit card loans 
the average loan size is generally small and risk is diversified among many borrowers 
our policy is to utilize credit scoring systems for most of our consumer loans  which offer the ability to modify credit exposure based on our risk tolerance and loss experience 
consumer loans totaled million at december   decreasing by million  or  from s year end balance of million  which increased by million  or  compared to the million held at year end automobile loans  primarily indirect dealer loans  comprised of consumer loans outstanding 
total automobile loans of million at year end decreased by million  or  from s year end balance of million  which increased by million  or  over the million at year end the decrease in automobile loans is reflective of the current decline in automobile purchases experienced in hawaii  which mirrors that experienced throughout the nation 
we have not focused significant resources on consumer lending in recent years as several large competitors have dominated the hawaii market 
with the exception of indirect dealer loans  consumer loans are generally offered as an accommodation to existing customers 
we expect consumer lending to remain a relatively small segment of our lending business 
interest reserves our policies require interest reserves for certain loan types including construction loans  including loans to build commercial buildings  residential developments both large tract projects and individual houses  and multi family projects  and land development loans  including loans to fund the acquisition of both raw land and entitled land being acquired for infrastructure and or capital improvements 
the outstanding principal balance of loans with interest reserves was million at december   compared to million in the prior year while remaining interest reserves was million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in principal loan balances with interest reserve and related remaining interest reserves from the prior year were primarily attributable to paydowns resulting from project completions 
interest reserves allow the company to advance funds to borrowers to make scheduled payments during the construction period 
these advances typically are capitalized and added to the borrower s outstanding loan balance  although we have the right to demand payment under certain circumstances 
our policy is to determine if interest reserve amounts are appropriately included in each project s construction budget and are adequate to cover the expected duration of the construction period 
the amount  terms  and conditions of the interest reserve are established when a loan is originated  although we have the option to demand payment if the credit profile of the borrower changes 
we evaluate the viability and appropriateness of the construction project based on the project s complexity and feasibility  the timeline  as well as the creditworthiness of the borrowers  sponsors and or guarantors  and the value of the collateral 
in the event that unfavorable circumstances alter the original project dynamics eg  cost overruns  project delays  etc  our policy is to evaluate whether or not it is appropriate to maintain interest capitalization or demand payment of interest in cash and will work with the borrower to explore various restructuring options  which may include obtaining additional equity and or requiring additional collateral 
we may also require borrowers to directly pay scheduled interest payments 
our process for determining that construction and land development projects are moving as planned are detailed in our lending policies and guidelines 
prior to approving a loan  the company and the borrower generally agree on a construction budget  a pro forma monthly disbursement schedule  and sales leaseback assumptions 
as each project progresses  the projections are measured against actual disbursements and sales lease results to determine if the project is on track and performing as planned 
the specific monitoring requirements for each loan vary depending on the size and complexity of the project and the experience and financial strength of the borrower  sponsor and or guarantor 
at a minimum  to ensure that loan proceeds are properly disbursed and to assess whether it is appropriate to capitalize interest or demand cash payment of interest  our monitoring process generally includes physical inspection of the project to ensure work has progressed to the stage for which payment is being requested  and verification that the work completed is in conformance with plans and specifications and items for which disbursement is requested are within budget 
in certain circumstances  we may decide to extend  renew  and or restructure the terms of a construction or development loan 
reasons for the restructure can range from cost overruns to project delays and the restructuring can result in additional funds being advanced or an extension of the maturity date of the loan 
prior to the loan being restructured  our policy is to perform a detailed analysis to ensure that the economics of the project remain feasible and that the risks to the company are within acceptable lending guidelines 
concentrations of credit risk as of december   approximately of loans outstanding were real estate related loans  including construction loans  residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans 
the real estate market tends to closely follow broader economic trends and during periods of economic strength  the real estate market and the real estate industry typically perform well 
during periods of economic weakness  this market often slows down 
in  the credit crisis in the financial markets and other economic conditions had a significant and immediate impact on the real estate industry 
accordingly  as we have experienced beginning in the second half of  the concentration of lending in the real estate industry led to adverse portfolio performance  namely delinquencies and loan charge offs 
our loan portfolio will continue to be adversely affected should the real estate market continue to decline 
most of our loans are made to companies and individuals with headquarters in or residing in the states of hawaii  california and washington 
consistent with our focus of being a hawaii based bank  of our loan portfolio was concentrated in the hawaii market  while was concentrated in california and the remaining in washington 
as a result of the deteriorated market conditions in the california real estate market  we anticipate that all new loan originations will come from the hawaii market in to manage risks associated with industry and geographic concentrations  our policy is to continuously monitor our portfolio to avoid any undue concentrations 
additionally  we employ loan officers with established client relationships  similar lending philosophies and demonstrated expertise in their respective markets

in january  we entered into a derivative transaction to hedge cashflows received from a portion of our then existing variable rate loan portfolio for a period of five years 
during this time  we will receive payments equal to a fixed interest rate of from the counterparty on a notional amount of million and  in return  we will pay to the counterparty a floating rate  namely our prime rate  on the same notional amount 
provision and allowance for loan and lease losses as described above in critical accounting policies and use of estimates  the provision is determined by management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio and our assessment of the ability of the allowance to cover inherent losses 
our methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance and the provision takes into account many factors  including the level and trend of nonperforming and potential problem loans  net charge off experience  current repayment by borrowers  fair value of collateral securing specific loans  changes in lending and underwriting standards and general economic factors  nationally and in the markets we serve 
the allowance consists of two components allocated and unallocated 
to calculate the allocated component  we combine specific reserves required for individual loans including impaired loans  reserves required for pooled graded loans and loan concentrations  and reserves required for homogeneous loans eg  consumer loans and residential mortgage loans 
we use a loan grading system whereby loans are segregated by risk 
certain graded commercial and commercial real estate loans are analyzed on an individual basis 
other graded loans are analyzed on an aggregate basis based on loss experience for the specific loan type  risks inherent in concentrations by geographic location  collateral or property type  and recent changes in loan grade and delinquencies 
the determination of an allocated allowance for homogeneous loans is done on an aggregate level based upon various factors including historical loss experience  delinquency trends and economic conditions 
the unallocated component of the allowance incorporates our judgment of the determination of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  economic uncertainties and imprecision in the estimation process

net loan charge offs for included charge offs for loans transferred to held for sale of million 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  loans held for sale and other real estate assets are not included in our assessment of the allowance 
given the uncertainty in the current economic environment  the increase in our allowance was deemed appropriate in light of the downward risk rating migration in parts of our loan portfolio and the reduced value of the collateral supporting our impaired commercial and residential construction loans 
to mitigate our exposure to the uncertain economic environment and unprecedented nature of the events in the credit and real estate markets  we have increased our efforts in monitoring and analyzing our allowance 
the increase in total nonaccrual and impaired loans  combined with reduced collateral values and increases in our loan loss factors  have contributed to the increased provision recognized during collateral values are determined based on appraisals received from qualified valuation professionals and are obtained periodically or when indicators that property values may be impaired are present 
risk volatility in our loan portfolio has been increasing  resulting in higher risk rating adjustment activity in recent quarters 
during the first half of  rapid risk rating migration occurred within our mainland residential tract development portfolio and began to spill over into portions of our mainland commercial construction portfolio and a few of our hawaii residential construction borrowers as the economic downturn continued and real estate values dropped 
recent events within the financial markets  retrenching consumer confidence  rising inflation and slow to negative job growth  have resulted in heightened risk within the various components of our loan portfolio 
table sets forth the allocation of the allowance by loan category as of the dates indicated 
our practice is to make specific allocations on impaired loans and general allocations to each loan category based on management s risk assessment and estimated loss rate 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is maintained to provide for additional credit risk which may exist but may not be adequately accounted for in the specific and unspecified allocations due to the amount of judgment involved in the determination of the allowance  the absence of perfect knowledge of all credit risks and the amount of uncertainty in predicting the strength of the economy and the sustainability of that strength

the allowance allocated to commercial loans at year end totaled million  or  of total commercial loans  compared to million  or  of total commercial loans as of year end the increase in the allocated allowance for commercial loans is reflective of the rise in criticized commercial loans during the year  which contributed to million of the current year increase 
the allowance allocated to construction loans totaled million  or  of construction loans at year end  compared to million  or  of construction loans outstanding at year end the increase in the amount of allowance allocated to construction loans is primarily a result of the continued deterioration of the california residential construction market  and to a lesser extent  preliminary signs of weakness in our california commercial construction and hawaii residential construction portfolios 
construction loans in general have a higher level of inherent risk as compared to other types of loans 
the allowance allocated to residential mortgage loans remained unchanged at million  or  of related loans at year end the relatively low level of allowance allocated to our residential mortgage loan portfolio reflects the strength in our residential mortgage portfolio as historical losses in this portfolio have been minimal 
commercial mortgage loans were allocated an allowance of million  or  of those loans at year end  increasing from million  or  of commercial mortgage loans at year end the rise in criticized loan balances during the year  were the result of an overall weakening in the real estate sector and contributed to million of the increase in the allocated allowance in the allocated allowance for consumer loans at year end decreased to million from million in the prior year  however  the assigned allowance as a percentage of the total consumer loan portfolio remained relatively consistent at 
we also allocated allowance for leases of million  or  of total leases compared to million  or  of total leases as of year end the unallocated portion of the allowance increased to million as of year end  compared to million in despite the fact that more known and perceived risks attributable to particular market segments and geographical risk considerations have been incorporated into the determination of the allocated allowance  we believe the increase in the unallocated portion of the allowance was appropriate due to the overall volatility of present and future economic conditions and the inherent uncertainty of the estimates and assumptions incorporated into our assessments of the likelihood and magnitude of potential losses

during  our total deposits of billion decreased by million  or  from total deposits of billion at december   which increased by million  or  over the year end balance of billion 
the decrease in deposits in was primarily attributable to the softening economy in hawaii  specifically  the slowing of hawaii s real estate market which contributed to a decrease in our escrow deposits

the average rate paid on all deposits in decreased to from in and in the drop in average rates paid in was attributable to the declining interest rate environment in which we  as well as other financial institutions throughout the country  operated in during the increase in average rates paid in was attributable to strong competition for core deposits from other hawaii financial institutions as well as from internet based and other financial services companies located outside of hawaii

asset liability management and interest rate risk our earnings and capital are sensitive to risk of interest rate fluctuations 
interest rate risk arises when rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities mature or reprice during different periods or in differing amounts 
in the normal course of business  we are subjected to interest rate risk through the activities of making loans and taking deposits  as well as from our investment securities portfolio and other interest bearing funding sources 
asset liability management attempts to coordinate our rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities to meet our financial objectives 
our asset liability management policy seeks to maximize the risk adjusted return to shareholders while maintaining consistently acceptable levels of liquidity  interest rate risk and capitalization 
our asset liability management committee  or alco  monitors interest rate risk through the use of interest rate sensitivity gap  net interest income and market value of portfolio equity simulation and rate shock analyses 
this process is designed to measure the impact of future changes in interest rates on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity 
adverse interest rate risk exposures are managed through the shortening or lengthening of the duration of assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk can be analyzed by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap and changes in the gap over time 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  the earnings of an institution with a positive gap theoretically may be positively affected due to its interest earning assets repricing to a greater extent than its interest bearing liabilities 
an adverse impact would be expected for an institution with a negative gap 
table sets forth information regarding our interest rate sensitivity gap at december  the assumptions used in determining interest rate sensitivity of various asset and liability products had a significant impact on the resulting table 
for purposes of this presentation  assets and liabilities are classified by the earliest repricing date or maturity 
all interest bearing demand and savings balances are included in the three months or less category  even though repricing of these accounts is not contractually required and may not actually occur during that period 
since all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same velocity or magnitude  and since volatility is subject to change  the interest rate sensitivity gap is only a general indicator of interest rate risk

the monthly simulation process is designed to measure the impact of future changes in interest rates on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity and to allow alco to model alternative balance sheet strategies

these estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the magnitude and timing of interest rate changes  prepayments on loans and investment securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment of asset and liability cashflows and others 
table presents information on financial instruments held that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for purposes of this presentation  expected maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities are contractual maturities 
interest bearing demand and savings deposits  which have indeterminate maturities  are included in the earliest maturity category 
the resulting table is based on numerous assumptions including prepayment rates on mortgage related assets and forecasted market interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the calculation of fair values 
maturities and fair values of interest sensitive assets and liabilities may vary from expectation if actual experience differs from the assumptions used 
liquidity our objective in managing our liquidity is to maintain a balance between sources and uses of funds in order to economically meet the cash requirements of customers for loans and deposit withdrawals and to participate in lending and investment opportunities as they arise 
we monitor our liquidity position in relation to trends of loan demand and deposit growth on a daily basis to assure maximum utilization  maintenance of an adequate level of readily marketable assets and access to short term funding sources 
the consolidated statements of cash flows identify the three major categories of sources and uses of cash as operating  investing and financing activities 
as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows  cash provided by operating activities has provided a steady source of funds during the past three years 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  million in and million in the primary source of cash provided by operating activities continues to be our net income  excluding non cash items 
investing activities have resulted in a use of cash in each of the last three years 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in investment securities and lending activities generally comprise the largest components of investing activities  although the level of investment securities activities are impacted by the relationship of loan and deposit growth during the period 
in  net loan originations accounted for million of cash used  compared to million in and million in net proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities totaled million in and million in compared to net purchases of investment securities of million in investing activities in includes proceeds from sales of loans originated for investment  securitized residential mortgage loans and other real estate owned of million  million and million  respectively 
investing activities in and also included purchases of bank owned life insurance policies totaling million and million  respectively 
cash used in financing activities totaled million in  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in and million in deposit activities  borrowings and capital transactions represent the major components of financing activities 
net deposit contraction in resulted in cash outflows of million  compared to net deposit growth in and  resulting in cash inflows of million and million  respectively 
cash flows from the issuance of long term debt  net of repayments thereon  totaled million of cash outflows in compared to million of cash inflows in and million of cash outflows in the net increase in short term borrowings in also resulted in cash inflows of million 
as with investment securities  the level of net borrowings is impacted by the levels of loan and deposit growth contraction during the period 
capital transactions  primarily dividends and the issuance or repurchase of common stock  required cash outflows of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for the holding company on a stand alone basis  the primary uses of funds in included dividend payments totaling million and share repurchases totaling million 
the primary source of funds in was dividends received from central pacific bank 
core deposits have historically provided us with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low cost of funds but are subject to competitive pressure in our market 
in addition to core deposit funding  we also have access to a variety of other short term and long term funding sources  which include proceeds from maturities of our investment securities  as well as secondary funding sources such as the fhlb seattle  secured repurchase agreements  federal funds borrowings  brokered certificates of deposit and the federal reserve discount window  available to meet our liquidity needs 
while we historically have had access to these other funding sources  the access to these sources may not be guaranteed due to the current volatile market conditions 
the bank is a member of and maintained a billion line of credit with the fhlb as of december  long term borrowings under this arrangement totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and there were no short term borrowings at the end of either period 
at december   approximately million remained available for future borrowings and the fhlb has the right to suspend future advances
