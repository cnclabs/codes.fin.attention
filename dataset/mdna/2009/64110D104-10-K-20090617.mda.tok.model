risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations 
please see page of this annual report on form k for additional discussion of these forward looking statements 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions  including the current economic downturn 
we are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed  and are currently contributing  to slowdowns in the computer  storage  and networking industries at large  as well as the information technology it market  resulting in reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on it related spending by our customers  increased price competition for our products from competitors  deferment of purchases and orders by customers due to budgetary constraints or changes in current or planned utilization of our systems  
table of contents risk of excess and obsolete inventories  excess facilities costs  higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue  increased risk of losses or impairment charges related to our investment portfolio  negative impacts from increased financial pressures on customers  distributors and resellers  negative impacts from increased financial pressures on key suppliers or contract manufacturers  and potential discontinuance of product lines or businesses and related asset impairments 
the turmoil in the global credit markets  the recent instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions 
the economic challenges we initially experienced in the united states have spread throughout the world 
if global economic and market conditions  or economic conditions in the united states or other key markets  remain uncertain  persist  or deteriorate further  we may experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  which could adversely impact our common stock price 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our operating results have in the past  and will continue to be  subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of numerous factors  some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following fluctuations in demand for our products and services  in part due to changes in general economic conditions and specific economic conditions in the computer  storage  and networking industries  a shift in federal government spending patterns  changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers spending plans and associated revenue  the level of price and product competition in our target product markets  the impact of the current adverse economic and credit environment on our customers  channel partners  and suppliers  including their ability to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures  the overall movement toward industry consolidations among both our competitors and our customers  our reliance on a limited number of suppliers due to industry consolidation  which could subject us to periodic supply and demand  price rigidity  and quality issues with our components  the timing of bookings or the cancellation of significant orders  product configuration and mix  the extent to which our customers renew their service and maintenance contracts with us  market acceptance of new products and product enhancements  announcements and introductions of  and transitions to  new products by us or our competitors  deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements introduced by us or our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce  and market new products and enhancements in a timely manner  technological changes in our target product markets  our levels of expenditure on research and development and sales and marketing programs  
table of contents our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations  excess or inadequate facilities  actual events  circumstances  outcomes and amounts differing from judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets including the amounts of valuation allowances  liabilities  and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements  disruptions resulting from new systems and processes as we continue to enhance and scale our system infrastructure  future accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting rules  such as the increased use of fair value measures and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs  seasonality  such as our historical seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year and seasonal increase in revenues in the second quarter of our fiscal year  with the latter due in part to the impact of the us federal government s september fiscal year end on the timing of its orders  and linearity  such as our historical intraquarter revenue pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter s total revenues occur in the last month of the quarter 
due to such factors  operating results for a future period are difficult to predict  and  therefore  prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
any of the foregoing factors  or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
it is possible that in one or more quarters our results may fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 
our revenue for a particular period is difficult to forecast  and a shortfall in revenue may harm our business and our operating results 
our revenues for a particular period are difficult to forecast  especially in light of the current global economic downturn and related market uncertainty 
product sales are also difficult to forecast because the storage and data management market is rapidly evolving  and our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer 
new or additional product introductions also increase the complexities of forecasting revenues 
additionally  we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter 
bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter 
if we do not achieve bookings in the latter part of a quarter consistent with our quarterly targets  our financial results will be adversely impacted 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast bookings and trends in our business 
sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision  the dollar amount of the sale and the products or services to be sold 
these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a bookings pipeline 
our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time  in part because the conversion rate of the pipeline into contracts varies from customer to customer  can be difficult to estimate  and requires management judgment 
small deviations from our forecasted conversion rate may result in inaccurate plans and budgets and could materially and adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations 
in particular  the continued adverse events in the economic environment and financial markets have made it even more difficult for us to forecast our future results and may result in a reduction in our quarterly conversion rate as our customers purchasing decisions are delayed  reduced in amount  or cancelled 
uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions has caused consumers  businesses and governments to defer purchases in response to tighter credit  decreased cash availability and declining customer confidence 
accordingly  future demand for our products could differ from our current expectations 

table of contents we have experienced periods of alternating growth and decline in revenues and operating expenses 
if we are not able to successfully manage these fluctuations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be significantly impacted 
the ongoing global financial crisis has led to a worldwide economic downturn that has negatively affected our business 
if the current economic downturn continues or worsens  demand for our products and services and our revenues may be further reduced 
a prolonged downturn can adversely affect our revenues  gross margin and results of operations 
during such economic downturns  it is critical to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions and to minimize the effect of such downturns on our operations  while also maintaining our capabilities and strategic investments for future growth 
our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenues  and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed 
we have a limited ability to quickly or significantly reduce our fixed costs  and if revenue levels are below our expectations  operating results will be adversely impacted 
during uneven periods of growth  we may incur costs before we realize some of the anticipated benefits  which could harm our operating results 
we have significant investments in engineering  sales  service support  marketing programs and other functions to support and grow our business 
we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits  and the return on these investments may be lower  or may develop more slowly  than we expect  which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
conversely  if we are unable to effectively manage our resources and capacity  during periods of increasing demand for our products  we could experience a material adverse effect on operations and financial results 
if the network storage market fails to grow  or grows slower than we expect  our revenues will be adversely affected 
also  even if it spending increases  our revenue may not grow at the same pace 
our gross margins have varied over time and may continue to vary  and such variation may make it more difficult to forecast our earnings 
our product gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including demand for storage and data management products  pricing actions  rebates  initiatives  discount levels  and price competition  direct versus indirect and oem sales  changes in customer  geographic  or product mix  including mix of configurations within each product group  product and add on software mix  the mix of services as a percentage of revenue  the mix and average selling prices of products  the mix of disk content  the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals  new product introductions and enhancements  excess inventory purchase commitments as a result of changes in demand forecasts and possible product and software defects as we transition our products  and the cost of components  manufacturing labor  quality  warranty  and freight 
changes in software entitlements and maintenance gross margins may result from various factors  such as the size of the installed base of products under support contracts  the timing of technical support service contract renewals  demand for and the timing of delivery of upgrades  
table of contents the timing of our technical support service initiatives  and the level of spending on our customer support infrastructure 
changes in service gross margins may result from various factors  such as the mix of customers  the size and timing of service contract renewals  the volume and use of outside partners to deliver support services on our behalf  and product quality and serviceability issues 
due to such factors  gross margins are subject to variations from period to period and are difficult to predict 
our cost reduction initiatives and restructuring plans may not result in anticipated savings or more efficient operations 
our recently announced restructuring may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operations and financial results 
on february   in response to the worsening global economic conditions and uncertainty about future it spending  we announced a restructuring of our worldwide operations in an effort to strategically align our cost structure with expected revenues  as well as to reallocate resources into areas of our business with more growth potential 
additionally  in december  we decided to cease development and availability of our snapmirror for open systems smos product  and as a result recorded restructuring and other charges attributable primarily to severance and employee related and facility closure costs  as well as the impairment of certain acquired intangible assets 
we may not be able to successfully complete and realize the expected benefits of these restructuring plans 
our restructuring plans may involve higher costs or a longer timetable  or they may fail to improve our gross margins  results of operations and cash flows as we anticipate 
our inability to realize these benefits may result in an ineffective business structure that could negatively impact our results of operations 
in addition to costs related to severance and other employee related costs  our restructuring plans may also subject us to litigation risks and expenses 
in addition  our restructuring plans may have other adverse consequences  such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce  the loss of employees with valuable knowledge or expertise  a negative impact on employee morale  or a gain in competitive advantage by our competitors over us 
the restructuring efforts could also be disruptive to our day to day operations and cause our remaining employees to be less productive  which in turn may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 
in the event that the economy recovers sooner than we expect and results in increased it spending  we may not have sufficient capacity to capitalize on the related increase in demand for our products and services 
we may undertake future cost reduction initiatives and restructuring plans that may adversely impact our operations  and we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our prior or any future restructurings 
changes in market conditions have led  and in the future could lead  to charges related to the discontinuance of certain of our products and asset impairments 
in response to changes in economic conditions and market demands  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider cost containment measures including restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise discontinuing certain products 
any decision to limit investment in  dispose of  or otherwise exit products may result in the recording of charges to earnings  such as inventory and technology related or other intangible asset write offs  workforce reduction costs  charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities  cancellation penalties or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products  which would harm our operating results 
our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets  including purchased intangible assets  could change as a result of such assessments and decisions 
additionally  we 
table of contents are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis  and between annual tests in certain circumstances when impairment indicators exist or if certain events or changes in circumstances have occurred 
future goodwill impairment tests may result in charges to earnings  which could materially harm our operating results 
our oem relationship with ibm may not continue to generate significant revenue 
in april  we entered into an oem agreement with ibm  which enables ibm to sell ibm branded solutions based on netappunified solutions  including nearstore and v series systems  as well as associated software offerings 
while this agreement is an element of our strategy to expand our reach into more customers and countries  we do not have an exclusive relationship with ibm  and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time  therefore  this relationship may not continue to contribute revenue in future years 
in addition  we have no control over the products that ibm selects to sell  or its release schedule and timing of those products  nor do we control its pricing 
in the event that sales through ibm increase  we may experience distribution channel conflicts between our direct sales force and ibm or among our channel partners 
if we fail to minimize channel conflicts  our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
we cannot assure you that this oem relationship will continue to generate significant revenue while the agreement is in effect  or that the relationship will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time 
if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop new relationships with major strategic partners  our revenue may be impacted negatively 
an element of our strategy to increase revenue is to strategically partner with major third party software and hardware vendors that integrate our products into their products and also co market our products with these vendors 
we have significant partner relationships with database  business application  backup management and server virtualization companies  including microsoft  oracle  sap  symantec and vmware 
a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage market 
there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners  and even if we can establish relationships with these or other partners  these partnerships may not generate significant revenue or may not continue to be in effect for any specific period of time 
if these relationships fail to materialize as expected  we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties 
we intend to continue to establish and maintain business relationships with technology companies to accelerate the development and marketing of our storage solutions 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships or maintaining our existing relationships  our future revenue and operating results could be impacted negatively 
in addition  the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales 
if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly  or if our distributors financial condition or operations weaken  our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 
we market and sell our storage solutions directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through channel partners such as value added resellers  systems integrators  distributors  oems and strategic business partners  and we derive a significant portion of our revenue from these channel partners 
during fiscal  revenues generated from sales through our channel partners accounted for of our revenues 
in order for us to maintain or increase our revenues  we must effectively manage our relationships with channel partners 
several factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model  which could materially harm our revenues and gross margins  including the following we compete with some of our channel partners through our direct sales force  which may lead these partners to use other suppliers who do not directly sell their own products  our channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear  
table of contents our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions  and revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our channel partners financial condition or operations weaken 
in addition  we depend on our channel partners to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate 
their failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
the us government has contributed to our revenue growth and has become an important customer for us 
future revenue from the us government is subject to shifts in government spending patterns 
a decrease in government demand for our products could materially affect our revenues 
in addition  our business could be adversely affected as a result of future examinations by the us government 
the us government has become an important customer for the storage market and for us  however  government demand is unpredictable  and there can be no assurance that we will maintain or grow our revenue from the us government 
government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in it spending 
if the government or individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital spending patterns  our revenues and operating results may be harmed 
in addition  selling our products to the us government also subjects us to certain regulatory requirements 
the failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to fines and other penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
for example  in april  we entered into a settlement agreement with the united states of america  acting through the united states department of justice doj and on behalf of the general services administration the gsa  under which we agreed to pay the united states million  plus interest of million  related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of its gsa contracts between august and february we are currently in discussions with the us government to demonstrate that we have implemented processes and procedures to ensure that we comply with federal contracting rules 
if we are unable to demonstrate to the us government that we have implemented such improved policies and procedures or if we are subject to an adverse outcome in any future examinations of our federal contracting practices  we could be suspended or debarred from contracting with the us government generally  or with any specific agency  which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and operating results 
a portion of our revenue is generated by large  recurring purchases from various customers  resellers and distributors 
a loss  cancellation or delay in purchases by these parties has and could continue to negatively affect our revenue 
during fiscal  two us distributors accounted for approximately and of our revenues  respectively 
the loss of continued orders from any of our more significant customers  strategic partners  distributors or resellers could cause our revenue and profitability to suffer 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the cost effectiveness  reliability  scalability  breadth and depth of our products 
we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers for an extended period of time  and thus we may not be able to continue to receive large  recurring orders from these customers  resellers or distributors 
for example  our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases and our customers  resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time 
recent turmoil in the credit markets may further negatively impact our operations by affecting the solvency of our customers  resellers and distributors  or the ability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products 
if the global economy and credit markets continue to deteriorate and our future sales decline  our financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 
because our expenses are based on our revenue forecasts  a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to  or unexpected returns from  customers and resellers  or the loss of any significant customer or reseller  
table of contents could harm our business 
although our largest customers may vary from period to period  we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend on large orders from significant customers 
in addition  a change in the mix of our customers could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins 
we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers  resellers  and distributors  as well as credit exposures in weakened markets  which could result in material losses 
most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis  with typical payment terms of days in the united states and  because of local customs or conditions  longer in some markets outside the united states 
we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements  and seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay 
beyond our open credit arrangements  we also have recourse or nonrecourse customer financing leasing arrangements with third party leasing companies through preexisting relationships with customers 
under the terms of recourse leases  which are treated as off balance sheet arrangements  we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third party leasing company in the event that any customers default 
we expect demand for customer financing to continue 
during periods of economic downturn in the storage industry and the global economy  our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases 
in addition  our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by the current global economic downturn  or if there is a continuation or worsening of the downturn 
although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risks  such programs may not be effective in reducing our credit risks 
in the past  there have been bankruptcies by our customers both who have open credit and who have lease financing arrangements with us  causing us to incur bad debt charges  and  in the case of financing arrangements  a loss of revenues 
there can be no assurance that additional losses will not occur in future periods 
any future losses could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
additionally  to the extent that the recent turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for customers to obtain open credit or lease financing  those customers ability to purchase our product could be adversely impacted  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
the market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future 
the market price for our common stock has experienced substantial volatility in the past  and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future 
these factors include but are not limited to fluctuations in our operating results  variations between our operating results and either the guidance we have furnished to the public or the published expectations of securities analysts  economic developments in the storage and data management market as a whole  fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  inquiries by the sec  nasdaq  law enforcement  or other regulatory bodies  international conflicts and acts of terrorism  announcements of new products  applications  or product enhancements by us or our competitors  changes in our relationships with our suppliers  customers  channel and strategic partners  and general market conditions  including the recent financial and credit crisis and global economic downturn 
in addition  the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of the equity securities of many technology companies 
certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates  the market climate for the technology sector  and levels of corporate spending on it  as well as variations in our expected operating performance  could continue to have an impact on the trading price of our stock 
as a result  the 
table of contents market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future  and any broad market decline may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change  if our new products do not achieve market acceptance  if we fail to manage the transition between our new and old products  or if we cannot provide the expected level of service and support for our new products  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products 
due to the complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products  such products are subject to significant technical risks 
in addition  our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  or if such products do not achieve market acceptance  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
new or additional product introductions increase the complexities of forecasting revenues  and if not managed effectively  may adversely affect our sales of existing products 
as new or enhanced products are introduced  we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories  and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers demands 
as we enter new or emerging markets  we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition 
we may not be able to provide products  service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities 
an increase in competition and industry consolidation could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
the storage markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology 
in the storage market  our primary and near line storage system products and our associated software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc  hitachi data systems  hp  ibm  and sun microsystems 
in addition  dell  inc is a competitor in the storage marketplace through its business arrangement with emc  which allows dell to resell emc storage hardware and software products  as well as through dell s acquisition of equallogic  through which dell offers low priced storage solutions 
in the secondary storage market  which includes the disk to disk backup  compliance and business continuity segments  our solutions compete primarily against products from emc and sun microsystems 
our vtl products also compete with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader data backup recovery space 
additionally  a number of small  newer companies have recently entered the storage systems and data management software markets  the near line and vtl storage markets and the high performance clustered storage markets  some of which may become significant competitors in the future 
there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years 
for example  in april  oracle corporation  one of our strategic partners  announced its plan to acquire sun microsystems 
we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations 
we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole source vendors for customers 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
competitive pressures we face could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

table of contents our future financial performance depends on growth in the storage and data management markets 
if these markets do not perform as we expect and upon which we calculate and forecast our revenues  our operating results will be materially and adversely impacted 
all of our products address the storage and data management markets 
accordingly  our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets 
the markets for storage and data management have been adversely impacted by the current global economic downturn and may not grow as anticipated or may continue to decline 
additionally  emerging standards in these markets may adversely affect the unix  windows and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend 
for example  we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services  healthcare  pharmaceutical and government market segments  industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access  reliability and permanence such as rule a of the securities exchange act of  as amended in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate 
if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard  customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products  and we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted 
supply chain issues  including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers  or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders  could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results  and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply  which could adversely affect our gross margins 
the fact that we do not own or operate our manufacturing facilities and supply chain exposes us to risks  including reduced control over quality assurance  production costs and product supply  which could have a material adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results 
financial problems of either contract manufacturers or component suppliers could limit supply  increase costs  or result in accelerated payment terms 
the loss of any contract manufacturer or key supplier could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products 
qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming 
if we are required to change contract manufacturers  we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships 
disruption or termination of manufacturing capacity or component supply could delay shipments of our products and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
such delays could also damage relationships with current and prospective customers and suppliers  and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed 
a return to growth in the economy is likely to put greater pressures on us  our contract manufacturers and our suppliers to accurately project demand and to establish optimal purchase commitment levels 
additionally  the reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies  inside or outside of our industry  or the inability by us to appropriately cancel  reschedule  or adjust our manufacturing or components requirements based upon business needs could result in either limitation of supply or increased costs from these suppliers 
if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products or if there is lack of demand for our products  we may have excess or inadequate inventory or incur cancellation charges or penalties  which would increase our costs and have an adverse impact on our gross margins 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for components such as disk drives  computer boards and microprocessors utilized in the assembly of our products 
in recent years  rapid industry consolidation has led to fewer component suppliers  which has and could subject us to future periodic supply constraints and price rigidity 
furthermore  as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers  we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market  or in amounts greater than 
table of contents our needs 
in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used  or are committed to buy components in amounts greater than our needs  our gross margins could decrease 
component quality is a risk and is particularly significant with respect to our suppliers of disk drives 
in order to meet product performance requirements  we must obtain disk drives of extremely high quality and capacity 
as suppliers upgrade their components  they regularly end of life older components 
as we become aware of an end of life situation  we attempt to make purchases or purchase commitments to cover all future requirements or find a suitable substitute component 
we may not be able to obtain a sufficient supply of components on a timely and cost effective basis 
our failure to do so may lead to an adverse impact on our business 
on the other hand  if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly or if there is reduced demand or no demand for our products  an oversupply of end of life components could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins 
we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and suppliers 
we may need to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and quality functions to meet anticipated demand 
the inability of our contract manufacturers or our component suppliers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products and materials suitable for our needs could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders 
our acquisitions may not provide the anticipated benefits and may disrupt our existing business 
as part of our strategy  we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products  expand the breadth of our markets  or enhance our technical capabilities 
on may   we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire data domain  inc data domain 
we subsequently amended the terms of the definitive agreement on june  the success of this and any future acquisition is impacted by a number of factors  and may be subject to the following risks the inability to successfully integrate the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  the loss of key employees  and substantial transaction costs and accounting charges 
exposure to litigation related to acquisitions 
for example  see the lawsuit related to data domain described in part i  item legal proceedings below 
this and any future acquisitions may also result in risks to our existing business  including dilution of our current stockholders percentage ownership to the extent we issue new equity  assumption of additional liabilities  incurrence of additional debt or a decline in available cash  adverse effects to our financial statements  such as the need to make large and immediate write offs or the incurrence of restructuring and other related expenses  liability for intellectual property infringement and other litigation claims  which we may or may not be aware of at the time of acquisition  and creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense or impairment charges 
in addition  failure to complete the data domain acquisition as planned could negatively impact our stock price 
the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may also result in impairment charges for goodwill or acquired intangibles 
for example  in fiscal we announced our decision to cease the development 
table of contents and availability of our smos product  which was originally acquired through our acquisition of topio  inc topio in fiscal  resulting in the impairment of acquired intangibles related to such acquisition 
additional or realized risks of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the occurrence of any of the above risks could seriously harm our business 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates  impairment of our investments could harm our financial results 
at april   we had billion in cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities and restricted cash and investments 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in us treasury securities  us government agency bonds  corporate bonds  corporate securities  auction rate securities  certificates of deposit  and money market funds  including the primary fund 
these investments are subject to general credit  liquidity  market and interest rate risks  which have been exacerbated by unusual events such as the financial and credit crisis  and bankruptcy filings in the united states which have affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
currently  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we may suffer losses if forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates 
currently  we do not use financial derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure 
the fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets 
these securities issuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade 
any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments 
changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the markets perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value 
if such investments suffer market price declines  as we experienced with some of our investments during fiscal  we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary 
as a result of the bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers  which occurred during fiscal  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million on our corporate bonds related to investments in lehman brothers securities and approximately million on our investments in the primary fund that held lehman brothers investments 
as of april   we have an investment in the primary fund  an aaa rated money market fund at the time of purchase  with a par value of million and an estimated fair value of million  which suspended redemptions in september and is in the process of liquidating its portfolio of investments 
we received total distributions of million during fiscal from the primary fund 
on december   it announced a plan for liquidation and distribution of assets that includes the establishment of a special reserve to be set aside out of its assets for pending or threatened claims  as well as anticipated costs and expenses  including related legal and accounting fees 
on february   the primary fund announced a plan to set aside billion of the fund s remaining assets as the special reserve which may be increased or decreased as further information becomes available 
the primary fund has received an sec order providing that the sec will supervise the distribution of assets from the primary fund 
our pro rata share of the billion special reserve is approximately million 
the primary fund plans to continue to make periodic distributions  up to the amount of the special reserve  on a pro rata basis 
we could realize additional losses in our holdings of the primary fund and may not receive all or a portion of our remaining balance in the primary fund as a result of market conditions and ongoing litigation against the fund 

table of contents if the conditions in the credit and capital markets continue to worsen  our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value  requiring further impairments  which could adversely impact our financial position and operating results 
funds associated with certain of our auction rate securities may not be accessible for more than months and our auction rate securities may experience further other than temporary declines in value  which would adversely affect our earnings 
auction rate securities ars held by us are securities with long term nominal maturities  which  in accordance with investment policy guidelines  had credit ratings of aaa and aaa at time of purchase 
interest rates for ars are reset through a dutch auction each month  which prior to february had provided a liquid market for these securities 
substantially all of our ars are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education  and we believe the credit quality of these securities is high based on this guarantee 
however liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for certain of our ars investments  with a par value of million at april  for each failed auction  the interest rate resets to a maximum rate defined for each security  and the ars continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms  although the principal associated with the ars will not be accessible until there is a successful auction or such time as other markets for ars investments develop 
as of april   we determined there was a total decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately million  of which we recorded temporary impairment charges of million  offset by unrealized gains of million  and million was recognized as an other than temporary impairment charge 
in addition  we have classified all of our auction rate securities as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheets of april  as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next months is uncertain 
although we currently have the ability and intent to hold these ars investments until recovery in market value or until maturity  if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in market liquidity does not occur  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future quarters 
our leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of our sale of billion of convertible senior notes in june the notes  we have a greater amount of long term debt than we have maintained in the past 
we also have a credit facility and various synthetic lease arrangements 
in addition  subject to the restrictions in our existing and any future financings agreements  we may incur additional debt 
our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including adversely affecting our ability to satisfy our obligations  increasing the portion of our cash flows from operations may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations  working capital  capital expenditures  expansion  acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes  impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  and making us more vulnerable to downturns in our business  our industry or the economy in general 
our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  regulatory and other factors 
we will not be able to control many of these factors  such as economic conditions and governmental regulations 
furthermore  our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt 
as a result  we may be required to repatriate funds from our foreign subsidiaries  which could result in a significant tax liability to us 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or if we are unable to repatriate sufficient or any funds from our foreign subsidiaries  in order to meet our expenses and debt service obligations  we may need to utilize our existing line of credit to obtain the necessary funds  or we may be required to raise additional funds 
if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason  we may not be able to obtain such funding or  if funding is 
table of contents available  obtain it on acceptable terms 
if we fail to make a payment on our debt  we could be in default on such debt  and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness 
we are subject to restrictive and financial covenants in our credit facility and synthetic lease arrangements 
the restrictive covenants may restrict our ability to operate our business 
our access to undrawn amounts under our credit facility and the ongoing extension of credit under our synthetic lease arrangements are subject to continued compliance with financial covenants  which could be more challenging in a difficult operating environment 
if we do not comply with these restrictive and financial covenants or otherwise default under the facility or arrangements  we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts under this credit facility or repurchase the properties and facility which are subject to the synthetic lease arrangements 
if we lose access to these credit facility and synthetic lease arrangements  we may not be able to obtain alternative financing on acceptable terms  which could limit our operating flexibility 
the agreements governing our credit facility and synthetic lease arrangements contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business  including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness  incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level  grant liens  sell all or substantially all our assets enter into certain mergers  change our business  enter into swap agreements  enter into transactions with our affiliates  and enter into certain restrictive agreements 
as a result of these restrictive covenants  our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing  if needed  may be significantly restricted 
we may also be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us  such as strategic acquisitions or joint ventures 
we are also required to comply with financial covenants under our credit facility and synthetic lease arrangements  and our ability to comply with these financial covenants is dependent on our future performance  which will be subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including prevailing economic conditions 
our failure to comply with the restrictive and financial covenants could result in a default under our credit facility and our synthetic lease arrangements  which would give the counterparties thereto the ability to exercise certain rights  including the right to accelerate the amounts owed thereunder and to terminate the arrangement  and could also result in a cross default with respect to our other indebtedness 
in addition  our failure to comply with these covenants and the acceleration of amounts owed under our credit facility and synthetic lease arrangements could result in a default under the notes  which could permit the holders to accelerate the notes 
if all of our debt is accelerated  we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt 
future issuances of common stock and hedging activities by holders of the notes may depress the trading price of our common stock and the notes 
any new issuance of equity securities  including the issuance of shares upon conversion of the notes  could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders  including holders who receive shares upon conversion of their notes  and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and the notes 
we may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons  including to finance our operations and business strategy including in connection with acquisitions  strategic collaborations or other transactions  to increase our capital  to adjust our 
table of contents ratio of debt to equity  to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options  or for other reasons 
in addition  the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock by holders of the notes 
the hedging or arbitrage could  in turn  affect the trading price of the notes  or any common stock that holders receive upon conversion of the notes 
conversion of our notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders 
the conversion of some or all of our outstanding notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the notes 
upon conversion of a note  we will satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash for the principal amount of the note and shares of common stock  if any  to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount 
there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the notes as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash 
the number of shares delivered upon conversion  if any  will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share 
any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could be used to satisfy short positions  or anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 
the note hedges and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the sale of the notes may affect the trading price of our common stock 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties the counterparties  which are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes 
at the same time  we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties pursuant to which we may issue shares of our common stock above a certain strike price 
in connection with these hedging transactions  the counterparties may have entered into various over the counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or purchased shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions at or following the pricing of the notes 
such activities may have had the effect of increasing the price of our common stock 
the counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or entering into other derivative transactions 
additionally  these transactions may expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance 
we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards and the diversification of counterparties 
the effect  if any  of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the notes will depend  in part  on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time  but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
in addition  if our stock price exceeds the strike price for the warrants  there could be additional dilution to our shareholders  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
lehman brothers otc derivatives  inc lehman otc is the counterparty to of our note hedges 
the bankruptcy filing by lehman otc on october  constituted an event of default under the hedge transaction that could  at our option  lead to termination under the hedge transaction to the extent we provide notice to lehman otc 
we have not terminated the note hedge transaction with lehman otc  and will continue to carefully monitor the developments impacting lehman otc 
this event of default is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  we could incur significant costs if we elect to replace this hedge transaction originally held with lehman otc 
if we do not elect to replace this hedge transaction  then we would be subject to potential dilution upon conversion of the notes if on the date of conversion the per share market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of 
the terms of the notes  the rights of the holders of the notes and other counterparties to note hedges and warrants were not affected by the bankruptcy filings of lehman otc 

table of contents our synthetic leases are off balance sheet arrangements that could negatively affect our financial condition and results 
we have invested substantial resources in new facilities and physical infrastructure  which will increase our fixed costs 
our operating results could be harmed if our business does not grow proportionately to our increase in fixed costs 
we have various synthetic lease arrangements with bnp paribas leasing corporation as lessor bbpplc for our headquarters office buildings and land in sunnyvale  california 
on april   we terminated two of the synthetic lease arrangements in an effort to manage our capital structure in light of the current economic environment 
the lease payments commitments associated with the remaining arrangements as of the termination date totaled million through fiscal these synthetic leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for leases as amended  and are not considered variable interest entities under fin no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities revised 
therefore  we do not include the properties or the associated debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
however  if circumstances were to change regarding our or bnpplc s ownership of the properties  or in bnpplc s overall portfolio  we could be required to consolidate the entity  the leased facilities and the associated debt 
our future minimum lease payments under these synthetic leases limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business by restricting the funds available for use in addressing such changes 
if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately to our increase in fixed costs  our operating results will be harmed 
if we elect not to purchase the properties at the end of the lease term  we have guaranteed a minimum residual value to bnpplc 
therefore  if the fair value of the properties declines below that guaranteed minimum residual value  our residual value guarantee would require us to pay the difference to bnpplc  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  financial condition and operating results 
reductions in headcount growth have resulted in excess capacity and vacant facilities 
in addition  we may experience changes in our operations in the future that could result in additional excess capacity and vacant facilities 
we will continue to be responsible for all carrying costs of these facilities operating leases until such time as we can sublease these facilities or terminate the applicable leases based on the contractual terms of the operating lease agreements  and these costs may have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we conduct a significant portion of our business outside the united states 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside of the us during fiscal and  our international revenues accounted for and of our total revenues  respectively 
in addition  we have several research and development centers overseas  and a substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside of the us accordingly  our business and our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting our international operations  some of which are beyond our control  including regulatory  political  or economic conditions in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements  government spending patterns  and acts of terrorism and international conflicts 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve  and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 
our international sales are denominated in us dollars and in foreign currencies 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets 
conversely  lowering our price in local currency may result in lower us based revenue 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of local operating expenses 
additionally  we have exposures to emerging market currencies  which can have extreme currency volatility 
we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every quarter 
the time value component of our cash flow hedges is recorded in earnings while all other gains and losses are marked to market through other comprehensive income until forecasted transactions occur  at which time such realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings 

table of contents these hedges attempt to reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange movements 
factors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets as well as widening interest rate differentials and the volatility of the foreign exchange market 
there can be no assurance that such hedging strategies will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include  among others  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations 
such factors could materially and adversely affect our future international sales and consequently our operating results 
our international operations are subject to other risks  including general import export restrictions and the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us law 
moreover  in many foreign countries  particularly in those with developing economies  it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by regulations applicable to us  such as the foreign corrupt practices act 
although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws  our employees  contractors and agents  as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations  may take actions in violation of our policies 
any such violation  even if prohibited by our policies  could subject us to fines and other penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have credit exposure to our hedging counterparties 
in order to minimize volatility in earnings associated with fluctuations in the value of foreign currency relative to the us dollar  we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currencies 
as a result of entering into these hedging contracts with major financial institutions  we may be subject to counterparty nonperformance risk 
should there be a counterparty default  we could be exposed to the net losses on the original hedge contracts or be unable to recover anticipated net gains from the transactions 
a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents balances is held overseas 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash domestically in order to fund our us operations and strategic opportunities and service our debt  we may incur a significant tax liability in order to repatriate the overseas cash balances  or we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
a portion of our earnings which is generated from our international operations is held and invested by certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
these amounts are not freely available for dividend repatriation to the united states without triggering significant adverse tax consequences  which could adversely affect our financial results 
as a result  unless the cash generated by our domestic operations is sufficient to fund our domestic operations  our broader corporate initiatives such as stock repurchases  acquisitions  and other strategic opportunities  and to service our outstanding indebtedness  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings  or we may need to expand our existing credit facility to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash 
such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders ownership 
furthermore  lenders  particularly in light of the current challenges in the credit markets  may not agree to extend us new  additional or continuing credit 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be forced to repatriate our foreign cash and incur a significant tax expense or we may not be able to take advantage of strategic opportunities  develop new products  respond to competitive pressures or repay our outstanding indebtedness 
in any such case  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents changes in our effective tax rate or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control  including earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are taxed at lower rates as compared to the us statutory tax rate  material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates as a result of a shift in the mix of pretax profits and losses by tax jurisdiction  our ability to use tax credits  or effective tax rates by tax jurisdiction that differ from our estimates  changing tax laws or related interpretations  accounting standards  regulations  and interpretations in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate  as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings  an increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  including certain stock based compensation expense  write offs of acquired in process research and development  and impairment of goodwill  the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods  changes related to our ability to ultimately realize future benefits attributed to our deferred tax assets  including those related to other than temporary impairments  tax assessments resulting from income tax audits or any related tax interest or penalties could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place  and a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings 
we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our non us customers 
these benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in the united states and in the countries in which our international operations are located 
future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 
we have not provided for united states federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes that may result on future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
the obama administration recently announced several proposals to reform united states tax rules  including proposals that may result in a reduction or elimination of the deferral of united states income tax on our future unrepatriated earnings 
absent a restructuring of some legal entities and their functionality  some of the future unrepatriated earnings would be taxed at the united states federal income tax rate 
additionally  the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit on may  held in xilinx inc v 
commissioner that stock based compensation must be included in the research and development cost base of companies that have entered into a cost sharing arrangement and must  therefore  be allocated among the participants based on anticipated benefits 
the court s reversal of the prior us tax court decision will impact our estimate of tax benefits that were required to be recognized under financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the xilinx case on our provision for income taxes for the first quarter of fiscal  but expect any final adjustment will be limited to a reduction of our unrecognized tax attributes 
our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the netherlands  which expires in if we are unable to negotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the current ruling  our effective tax rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected 
our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations  which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole 
our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations and how the operations are managed and structured 
the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 

table of contents we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the united states and several foreign tax jurisdictions 
the rights to some of our intellectual property ip are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries  and payments are made between us and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this ip in a qualified cost sharing arrangement 
in recent years  several other us companies have had their foreign ip arrangements challenged as part of irs examinations  which has resulted in material proposed assessments and or pending litigation with respect to those companies 
during fiscal  we received notices of proposed adjustments from the irs in connection with federal income tax audits conducted with respect to our fiscal and tax years 
if the ultimate determination of income taxes assessed under the current irs audit or under audits being conducted in any of the other tax jurisdictions in which we operate results in an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for  our operating results  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we may face increased risks and uncertainties related to our current or future investments in nonmarketable securities of private companies  and these investments may not achieve our objectives 
on occasion  we make strategic investments in nonmarketable securities of development stage entities 
as of april   the carrying value of our investments in nonmarketable securities totaled million 
investments in nonmarketable securities are inherently risky  and some of these companies are likely to fail 
their success or lack thereof is dependent on product development  market acceptance  operational efficiency and other key business success factors 
in addition  depending on these companies future prospects  they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed  or they may receive lower valuations  with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings  and our investments in them would likely become impaired 
we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
for example  during fiscal we determined that our investments in nonmarketable securities of two companies had been impaired  and we recorded impairment charges of million 
if we are unable to establish fair value for any undelivered element of a sales arrangement  all or a portion of the revenue relating to the arrangement could be deferred to future periods 
in the course of our sales efforts  we often enter into multiple element arrangements that include our systems and one or more of the following undelivered software related elements software entitlements and maintenance  premium hardware maintenance  and storage review services 
if we are required to change the pricing of our software related elements through discounting  or otherwise introduce variability in the pricing of such elements  we may be unable to maintain vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements of the arrangement  and would therefore be required to delay the recognition of all or a portion of the related arrangement 
a delay in the recognition of revenue may cause fluctuations in our financial results and may adversely affect our operating margins 
our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of a natural disaster  terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 
we depend on the ability of our personnel  raw materials  equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world 
any political  military  world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions 
furthermore  any strike  economic failure or other material disruption caused by fire  floods  hurricanes  power loss  power shortages  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business 
if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology  or directly impact our marketing  manufacturing  financial and logistics functions  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  our headquarters are located in northern california  an area susceptible to earthquakes 
if any significant disaster were to occur  our ability to operate our business could be impaired 
we depend on attracting and retaining qualified technical and sales personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain such personnel  our operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 
our continued success depends  in part  on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified technical and sales personnel 
because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products  we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education  background and industry experience 
competition for qualified 
table of contents engineers  particularly in silicon valley  can be intense 
the loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or salespeople could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
undetected software errors  hardware errors  or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues 
product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue  gross margins and operating results 
our products may contain undetected software errors  hardware errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
if we fail to remedy a product defect  we may experience a failure of a product line  temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market  damage to our reputation  inventory costs or product reengineering expenses  any of which could have a material impact on our revenue  gross margins and operating results 
in addition  we may be subject to losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects in our products  which could subject us to claims for damages  including consequential damages 
based on our historical experience  we believe that the risk of exposure to product liability claims is low 
however  should we experience increased exposure to product liability claims  our business could be adversely impacted 
we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business  including our ongoing litigation with sun microsystems 
litigation can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  contractual provisions  and patents to protect our proprietary rights 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret  copyright and patent laws  which afford only limited protection 
some of our us trademarks are registered internationally as well 
we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers  strategic partners and customers 
we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued 
the pending applications may not be approved  and our existing and future patents may be challenged 
if such challenges are brought  the patents may be invalidated 
we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  or where any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties 
further  the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business 
in addition  a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive position 
litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology 
any such litigation may be time consuming and costly 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products  or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 
we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims 
we may  from time to time  receive claims that we are infringing third parties intellectual property rights 
third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products  patents  trademarks or other proprietary rights 
we expect that companies in the network storage market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and 
table of contents competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  require us to redesign our products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we are continually seeking ways to make our cost structure more efficient  including moving activities from higher to lower cost owned locations  as well as outsourcing certain business process functions 
problems with the execution of these changes could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we continuously seek to make our cost structure more efficient 
we are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability  and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging our global capabilities  as well as external talent and skills worldwide 
for example  certain engineering activities and projects that were formally performed in the us have been moved to lower cost international locations 
the challenges involved with these initiatives include executing business functions in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards  controls and procedures 
in addition  we will rely on partners or third party service providers for the provision of certain business process functions in it and accounting  and as a result  we may incur increased business continuity risks 
for example  we may no longer be able to exercise control over some aspects of the future development  support or maintenance of outsourced operations and processes  including the internal controls associated with those outsourced business operations and processes  which could adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to effectively utilize or integrate and interoperate with external resources or if our partners or third party service providers experience business difficulties or are unable to provide business process services as anticipated  we may need to seek alternative service providers or resume providing these business processes internally  which could be costly and time consuming and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our business could be materially adversely affected by changes in regulations or standards regarding energy efficiency of our products 
we continually seek ways to increase the energy efficiency of our products 
recent analyses have estimated the amount of global carbon emissions that are due to information technology products 
as a result  governmental and non governmental organizations have turned their attention to development of regulations and standards to drive technological improvements and reduce such amount of carbon emissions 
there is a risk that the rush to development of these standards will not fully address the complexity of the technology developed by the it industry or will favor certain technological approaches 
depending on the regulations or standards that are ultimately adopted  compliance could adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance  public disclosure  accounting and tax requirements that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 
because our common stock is publicly traded  we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal  state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the sec  and nasdaq  have implemented requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress  most notably the sarbanes oxley act of our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue resulting in  increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
we completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended april  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of although our assessment  testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of april   our internal controls over financial reporting were effective  we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods 
if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods  our business and reputation could be harmed 
we may incur additional expenses and commitment of 
table of contents management s time in connection with further evaluations  either of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 
because new and modified laws  regulations  and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 
changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements  such as the increased use of fair value measures and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs  could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business
