overview we are a medical device company focused on the design  development and commercialization of continuous glucose monitoring systems for ambulatory use by people with diabetes and for use by healthcare providers in the hospital for the treatment of both diabetic and non diabetic patients 
on march   we received approval from the fda for our first product  the sts  designed for up to three days of continuous use 
on may   we received approval from the fda for our second generation continuous glucose monitoring system  the seven  designed for up to seven days of continuous use  and we began commercializing this product in the third quarter of as part of our commercialization of the seven  we discontinued sales of our sts three day durable system in the second quarter of and discontinued the sale of our three day sensors during the second quarter of on february   we received approval from the fda for our third generation continuous glucose monitoring system  which we expect to brand the seven plus  and we expect to begin commercializing this product in the first quarter of our approvals allow for the use of our continuous glucose monitoring systems by adults with diabetes to detect trends and track glucose patterns  to aid in the detection of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and to facilitate acute and long term therapy adjustments 
our approved products must be prescribed by a physician and include a disposable sensor  a transmitter and a small handheld receiver 
our approved products are indicated for use as adjunctive devices to complement  not replace  information obtained from standard home blood glucose monitoring devices and must be calibrated periodically using a standard home blood glucose monitor 
the sensor is inserted by the patient and is intended to be used continuously for up to seven days after which it is removed by the patient and may be replaced by a new sensor 
our transmitter and receiver are reusable 
on november   we received ce mark conformit europ ene approval for the seven  enabling commercialization of the seven system in the european union and the countries in asia and latin america that recognize the ce mark 
we expect to commercialize the seven on a limited basis in the european union in from inception to  we devoted substantially all of our resources to start up activities  raising capital and research and development  including product design  testing  manufacturing and clinical trials 
since  we have devoted considerable resources to the commercialization of our ambulatory continuous glucose monitoring systems  including the seven  as well as the continued research and clinical development of our technology platform 
we have yet to seek approval from the fda for our in hospital continuous glucose monitoring system 
according to the world health organization  in there were more than million people who suffered from diabetes worldwide 
in  there were an estimated million people in the united states with diabetes  of which million have been diagnosed  an increase of million and million  respectively  from 
table of contents the centers for disease control and prevention cdc estimates that approximately million of these patients were treated with insulin 
the increased prevalence of diabetes is believed to be the result of an aging population  unhealthy diets and increasingly sedentary lifestyles 
according to the cdc  diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death by disease in the united states during  and complications related to diabetes include heart disease  limb amputations  loss of kidney function and blindness 
according to the ada  the direct medical costs and indirect expenditures attributable to diabetes in the united states were an estimated billion in  an increase of billion since of the billion in overall expenses  the ada estimates that approximately billion were direct medical costs 
according to industry sources  the worldwide market for personal glucose monitoring systems and related disposables  which include test strips and lancets  was approximately billion in  and was expected to grow to billion during we have built a direct sales organization to call on endocrinologists  physicians and diabetes educators who can educate and influence patient adoption of continuous glucose monitoring 
we believe that focusing efforts on these participants is important given the instrumental role they each play in the decision making process for diabetes therapy 
we currently sell the seven only in the united states and in portions of europe  but plan to expand our sales elsewhere in the future 
in september  we established a wholly owned subsidiary in sweden and hired a vice president of international business development to begin our expansion outside the united states 
to complement our direct sales efforts  we also employ clinical specialists who educate and provide clinical support in the field  and have entered into a limited number of distribution arrangements that allow distributors to sell our products 
we believe our direct  highly specialized and focused sales organization is sufficient for us to support our sales efforts and have no immediate plans to increase the size of the sales organization 
we are leveraging our technology platform to enhance the capabilities of our current products and to develop additional continuous glucose monitoring products 
in january  we entered into two separate development agreements  one with animas  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  and one with insulet  to integrate our technology into the insulin pump product offerings of the respective partner  enabling the partner s insulin pump to receive glucose readings from our transmitter and display this information on the pump s screen 
we are continuing clinical development of a fourth generation ambulatory product which we expect will further improve sensor reliability  stability and accuracy over the useful life of the sensor  and will be suited for large scale manufacturing 
we also intend to seek approval for a pediatric indication patients under years of age and a pregnancy indication diabetes patients who become pregnant and patients who develop gestational diabetes for our product platform in the future 
in addition  we are developing a product platform specifically for the in hospital glucose monitoring market  with an initial focus on the development of an intravenous sensor specifically for the critical care market 
to that end  on november   we entered into a definitive collaboration agreement with edwards to develop products for continuously monitoring glucose levels in hospitalized patients 
our development timelines are highly dependent on our clinical trials  and may be delayed due to scheduling issues with patients and investigators  institutional review boards  sensor performance and manufacturing supply constraints  among other factors 
in addition  support of these clinical trials requires significant resources from employees involved in the production of our products  including research and development  manufacturing  quality assurance  and clinical and regulatory personnel 
even if our development and clinical trial efforts are successful  the fda may not approve our products  and if approved  we may not achieve acceptance in the marketplace by physicians and patients 
as a medical device company  reimbursement from medicare and private third party healthcare payors is an important element of our success 
on november   the centers for medicare and medicaid  or cms  released its alpha numeric hcpcs file  which included three separate codes applicable to each of the three components of our continuous glucose monitoring systems  and hcpcs codes for continuous glucose monitoring became effective on january  hcpcs codes are billing codes used by medicare and private third party payors  but do not represent a reimbursement coverage decision by cms and  to date  our approved 
table of contents products are not reimbursed by virtue of a national coverage decision by medicare 
as of january  a number of private third party payors have issued coverage policies for the category of continuous glucose monitoring devices 
in addition  we have negotiated contracted rates with several of the largest private insurance providers in the united states for the purchase of our products by their members 
many of these coverage policies are restrictive in nature and require the patient to comply with documentation and other requirements to demonstrate medical necessity under the policy 
in addition  patients who are insured by payors that do not offer coverage for our devices will have to bear the financial cost of the products 
we currently employ in house reimbursement expertise to assist patients in obtaining reimbursement from private third party payors 
we also maintain a field based reimbursement team charged with calling on third party private payors to obtain coverage decisions and contracts 
we have had formal meetings and have increased our efforts to create coverage policies with third party payors during and expect to continue to do so in however  unless government and other third party payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products  patients may not use them 
we currently manufacture our devices at our headquarters in san diego  california 
in this facility we have more than  square feet of laboratory space and approximately  square feet of controlled environment rooms 
during  we also maintained a portion of our manufacturing operations at our second facility in san diego  california  which was located at our former headquarters 
in the fourth quarter of  we exited the second facility and currently only conduct operations at our headquarters facility 
in november  our facilities were subject to a post approval pma and qsr audit by fda 
at the close of the inspection  fda issued a form identifying several inspectional observations  the majority of which were corrected and verified while the fda investigator was on site and  although we have no formal requirements or obligations to provide anything further to the fda regarding these observations  in january  we voluntarily provided formal written evidence to fda of actions taken to address one remaining minor observation 
based on the results of this inspection  we believe we are in substantial compliance with the regulatory requirements for a commercial medical device manufacturer 
we manufacture our seven with components supplied by outside vendors and with parts manufactured internally 
key components that we manufacture internally include the wire based sensor for our seven 
the remaining components and assemblies are purchased from outside vendors 
we then assemble  test  package and ship the finished product  which includes a reusable transmitter  a receiver and a disposable sensor 
we are expanding our manufacturing capacity in our facilities in san diego  california 
our capacity expansion could be constrained by the lack of material availability  equipment design  production and validation  regulatory approval of any required additional facilities  personnel staffing and other factors 
product revenues are generated from the sale of durable continuous glucose monitoring systems receivers and transmitters and disposable sensors through a direct sales force in the united states as well as through distribution arrangements in the united states and in portions of europe 
the sensor is inserted by the patient and intended to be used continuously for up to seven days  after which it may be replaced with a new disposable sensor 
our transmitter and receiver are reusable 
in the event we establish an installed base of patients using our products  we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenues through recurring sales of our disposable sensors 
we recognize revenue on our products upon shipment and our sales terms provide for customer payment at the time of order  or payment due within negotiated contractual terms with insurance payors  or with the issuance of a purchase order or letter of credit for certain distributors and institutions 
from inception through december   we had generated million of product and development grant non product revenue  and we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in may from inception through december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our losses to continue as we continue our commercialization and research and development activities 
we have financed our operations primarily through offerings of equity securities and convertible debt 
in april  we completed our initial public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
in march  we entered into a loan agreement  which was subsequently amended in january as of december   we had an outstanding balance of million under the loan agreement 
in may  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of 
table of contents million 
in march  we issued an aggregate principal amount of million of convertible senior notes due in in february  we completed a public follow on stock offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
financial operations revenue from inception through december   we generated million in product revenue from the sale of our continuous glucose monitoring systems 
we expect that revenues we generate from the sales of our products will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a joint development agreement with animas corporation and we recognize development grant revenue received pursuant to that agreement ratably over the term of the agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a collaboration agreement with edwards and we recognize development grant revenue received pursuant to that agreement ratably over the term of the agreement 
from inception through december   we recognized million in development grant revenue 
cost of sales product cost of sales includes direct labor and materials costs related to each product sold or produced  including assembly  test labor and scrap  as well as factory overhead supporting our manufacturing operations 
factory overhead includes facilities  material procurement and control  manufacturing engineering  quality control  supervision and management 
these costs are primarily salary  fringe benefits  stock based compensation  facility expense  supplies and purchased services 
the majority of our costs are currently fixed due to our relatively low production volumes compared to our potential capacity 
all of our manufacturing costs are included in product cost of sales 
development cost of sales consists primarily of salaries  fringe  facilities  and supplies directly attributable to our development contracts 
research and development our research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering and research expenses related to our continuous glucose monitoring technology  clinical trials  regulatory expenses  materials and products for clinical trials 
until december  our manufacturing costs were included in research and development expense 
research and development expenses are primarily related to employee compensation  including salary  fringe benefits  stock based compensation  and temporary employee expenses 
we also incur significant expenses to operate our clinical trials including clinical site reimbursement  clinical trial product and associated travel expenses 
our research and development expenses also include fees for design services  contractors and development materials 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salary  fringe benefits and stock based compensation for our executive  financial  sales  marketing and administrative functions 
other significant expenses include trade show expenses  sales samples  insurance  professional fees for our outside legal counsel and independent auditors  litigation expenses and expenses for board meetings 
results of operations fiscal year ending december  compared to december  revenue  cost of sales and gross margin product revenues increased million to million for the twelve months ending december  compared to million for the twelve months ending december  based primarily on increased sales volume and higher average per unit selling prices 
product cost of sales increased  to million for 
table of contents the twelve months ending december  compared to million for the twelve months ending december  the increased product cost of sales associated with additional product sales was offset primarily by increased manufacturing absorption for the twelve months ending december  as compared to the same period in the product gross margin loss of million for the twelve months ending december  decreased million compared to million for the same period in  primarily due to increased revenue and better direct labor utilization 
development grant revenues totaled million for the twelve months ending december  and development cost of sales totaled million 
there were no development grant revenues or development cost of sales generated during the increase in both revenues and costs associated with development was primarily due to our entry into a joint development agreement with animas corporation during the first quarter of and our entry into a collaboration agreement with edwards lifesciences llc in the fourth quarter of research and development 
research and development expense increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the twelve months ending december  changes in research and development expense include million in higher development costs and million in higher clinical and regulatory and quality assurance costs 
major elements of increased research and development costs include million in additional consulting fees  million in increased facilities costs  and  in additional supplies 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the twelve months ending december  the increase was primarily due to higher selling  legal and marketing costs 
major elements of increased selling  general  and administrative expenses include million in higher share based compensation   in increased facilities costs  and  in higher salaries 
interest income 
interest income decreased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the twelve months ending december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower average interest bearing cash and marketable securities balances and lower yields earned on those balances during the twelve months ending december  as compared to the same period of interest expense 
interest expense increased  to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the twelve months ending december  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to our million in convertible senior notes outstanding for the entire twelve months ending december  compared to a shorter period of time during the twelve months ending december  following the issuance in march of fiscal year ending december  compared to december  revenue  cost of sales and gross margin 
revenues increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million during the same period in following the launch of our first product in march of and our second generation product in june of cost of sales increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the twelve months ending december  the increase in cost of sales in was primarily attributed to supporting increased product sales and included million in additional fixed overhead spending 
the gross margin loss of million for the twelve months ended december  decreased  compared to the same period in  primarily due to increased revenue 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expense decreased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period in development expenses decreased million and clinical and regulatory costs decreased by  major elements of declining research and development costs include  in lower tooling and fixture costs   in lower facilities costs  and  in lower share based compensation costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period in the increase in expense was primarily due to million in higher sales costs incurred for the entirety of fiscal  compared to lower levels incurred during fiscal when we began building our sales force 
the million increase in selling related costs was partially offset by million in lower marketing costs 
major changes in selling  general and administrative expense included million in additional payroll related costs  offset by million in lower legal expense and  in lower trade show costs 
during   in separation payments to our former ceo and cfo were included within personnel expenses along with an additional  for their extended vesting and post employment exercise period that was included within share based compensation costs 
interest income 
interest income increased  to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period in the increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average interest bearing cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances attributed to the million aggregate principal convertible senior notes we issued in march of interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to  for the same period in the increase in interest expense was primarily due to million in additional interest expense attributed to the million aggregate principal convertible senior notes we issued in march of liquidity and capital resources we are in the early commercialization stage and have incurred losses since our inception in may as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and had working capital of million 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled million  excluding million in restricted cash 
we have funded our operations primarily from the sale of equity and debt securities and our bank line  raising aggregate net proceeds of million from equity sales and million from debt sales through december  as of december  we had a total of million outstanding under our amended bank equipment loan that we are required to repay through july on february   the company completed a public follow on stock offering selling an aggregate of  shares of its common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million net cash used for the same period in the increase in cash used in operations was primarily due to million in additional net loss  offset by million in changes in operating assets and liabilities and million in additional non cash charges primarily comprised of share based compensation 
of the million in changes in operating assets and liabilities  million was due to additional deferred revenue and million was due to additional restricted cash requirements 
net cash provided by investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million used for the same period of the increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to million decrease in cash used to purchase available for sale marketable securities offset by million decreased in proceeds from the maturities of short term marketable securities for the twelve months ending december  as compared to the same 
table of contents period in for the twelve months ending december   we invested million in equipment to support manufacturing improvements compared to million during the same period in net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period of the decrease was primarily due to the million in net convertible debt proceeds generated for the twelve months ending december  compared to none in the same period of operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we incur expenses to commercialize our approved products  develop additional continuous glucose monitoring products  and expand our marketing  manufacturing and corporate infrastructure 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term marketable securities balances  the cash received from our stock offering  and projected cash contributions from existing partnership arrangements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements with respect to the scale up of our commercialization activities  research and development activities  including clinical trials  the expansion of our marketing  manufacturing and corporate infrastructure  and to meet our other anticipated cash needs through if our available cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we develop additional products  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock  these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional cash contributions from future partnership arrangements 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay or eliminate some or all of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our business 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of continuous glucose monitoring technologies  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the revenue generated by sales of our approved products and other future products  the expenses we incur in manufacturing  developing  selling and marketing our products  the quality levels of our products and services  the third party reimbursement of our products for our customers  our ability to efficiently scale our manufacturing operations to meet demand for our current and any future products  the costs and timing of additional regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  including  but not limited to  defending the patent infringement lawsuit filed against us by abbott  the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other development activities  the success of our research and development efforts  
table of contents the emergence of competing or complementary technological developments  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  and the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
contractual obligations in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in a private offering 
the notes are convertible into shares of common stock based on an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
interest on the notes is due semiannually on march and september of each year at a rate of per year 
the notes will be redeemable by us beginning march  at a price equal to of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes for cash equal to of the principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of certain designated events  including a change of control 
in addition  we will have the right to automatically convert the notes if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price or per share  for at least trading days during any day period 
if such an automatic conversion occurs before march   we are required to pay additional interest in cash or  at our option  in shares of our common stock 
the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes for cash on march   march  and march  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
as of december   we had an outstanding balance of million due on our bank equipment loan 
we are required to repay the outstanding balance in monthly installments through september on january   we amended our bank equipment loan to enable us to draw an additional million 
beginning april  this additional amount requires monthly amortized payments through the maturity date of july in april  we entered into an office lease agreement for approximately  square feet of additional facilities located in san diego  california 
the initial term of this lease is eight years and we have a five year option to renew the lease upon the expiration of the initial term 
in connection with the lease  we entered into a  letter of credit to secure future payments under the lease and paid a security deposit in the amount of  in april we also currently maintain a second lease for approximately  square feet which expires in for our former headquarters facility 
we exited our former headquarters facility in the fourth quarter of and have yet to sublease the property 
in january  we entered into a sublease agreement to sublet an existing facility near our corporate headquarters to a third party 
under the terms of the agreement  we sublet approximately  square feet of facilities space at terms and conditions  including real estate taxes and operating costs  which mirror the original lease agreement 
we retain obligations per the original lease which expires in may these facility leases have annual rental escalation clauses and are expensed on a straight line basis 
in november  we entered into a one year lease for approximately  square feet of storage 
in november  we renewed the lease of the storage facility for an additional year 
in september  our subsidiary in sweden entered into a three year lease for a small shared office space  which has a quarterly adjustment clause for rent to increase or decrease in proportion to changes in consumer prices 
excluding real estate taxes and operating costs  we are required to make future monthly payments for the period from december through april totaling million 
we are party to various purchase arrangements related to components used in production and research and development activities 
as of december   we had purchase commitments with certain vendors totaling approximately million due within one year 
there are no purchase commitments due beyond one year 

table of contents the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years notes payable operating leases purchase commitments total off balance sheet arrangements we have not engaged in any off balance sheet activities 
related party transactions our chairman is a director of oracle corporation 
we incurred costs totaling   and  relating to an oracle erp system for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the chairman was not involved in the selection of the company s erp system 
we believe that the aforementioned arrangement was at no less favorable rates to us than those that could have been obtained from unrelated third parties based on review of price quotations with third parties 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results 
revenue recognition we sell durable systems and disposable units through a direct sales force in the united states as well as through distribution arrangements in the united states and in portions of europe 
components are individually priced and can be purchased separately or together 
the seven durable system includes a transmitter  a receiver  a power cord  data management software and a usb cable 
disposable sensors for use with the seven are sold separately in packages of four 
the initial seven durable system price is not dependent upon the purchase of any amount of disposable seven sensors 
we discontinued sales of our sts three day durable system in the second quarter of and we discontinued the sale of our three day sensors during the second quarter of revenue on product sales is recognized upon shipment  which is when title and the risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and there are no other post shipment obligations 
with respect to customers who directly pay for the products  the products are generally paid for at the time of shipment using a customer s credit 
table of contents card and do not include customer acceptance provisions 
we recognize revenue from contracted insurance payors based on the contracted rate 
for non contracted insurance payors  we obtain a prior authorization from the payor and recognize revenue based on the estimated collectible amount and historical experience 
in all situations  we receive a prescription or statement of medical necessity and  for insurance reimbursement customers  an assignment of benefits prior to shipment 
after approval of our second generation continuous glucose monitoring system  the seven  on may   we started taking orders for an upgrade kit to upgrade existing customers for before the upgrade kit became available for shipment  for systems sold that included an upgrade right  a portion of the sales price was allocated to the undelivered upgrade kit and deferred based on the fair value of the upgrade kit 
this deferred revenue was recognized when the upgrade kit was delivered to the customer 
as of december   we no longer had a deferred product revenue balance for this program 
in august  we adopted a day money back guarantee program whereby customers who purchase the seven durable system and a package of four disposable sensors may return the seven durable system for any reason within thirty days of purchase and receive a full refund of their purchase price 
at december   we maintained a reserve balance of  relating to this program 
we accrue for estimated returns and or refunds by reducing revenues and establishing a liability account at the time of shipment based on historical experience 
during  we entered into distribution agreements with rgh enterprises  inc  or edgepark  and other distributors that allow the distributors to sell our durable systems and disposable units 
revenue on product sales to distributors is recognized at the time of shipment  which is when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the distributor and there are no other post shipment obligations 
revenue is recognized based on contracted prices and invoices are either paid by check following the issuance of a purchase order or letter of credit  or they are paid by wire at the time of placing the order 
terms of distributor orders are fob shipping point fca shipping point for international orders 
distributors do not have rights of return per their distribution agreement outside of our standard warranty 
we accrue for estimated returns  refunds and rebates by reducing revenues and establishing a liability account at the time of shipment based on historical experience 
our distributors typically have a limited time frame to notify us of any missing  damaged  defective or non conforming products 
for any such products  we shall either  at our option  replace the portion of defective or non conforming product at no additional cost to the distributor or cancel the order and refund any portion of the price paid to us at that time for the sale in question 
we have no intention of refunding or unwinding a prior sale and view any potential non conformity solely as a warranty issue 
during  we shipped product directly to edgepark s customers and recognized million in revenue  which represents of the company s revenues for the twelve months ending december  with respect to another domestic distributor  we shipped product to the distributor and recognized  in revenue from this arrangement for the twelve months ending december  this distributor stocks inventory of the product and fulfills orders from their inventory 
we monitor shipments and on hand inventory levels to this distributor  and at december   this distributor had a limited amount of our product in their inventory 
in december  we shipped a small amount of product to our international distributor in europe 
during  we have entered into collaborative license and development arrangements with strategic partners for the development and commercialization of products utilizing our technologies 
the terms of these agreements typically include multiple deliverables by us for example  license rights  provision of research and development services  and manufacture of clinical materials in exchange for consideration to us of some combination of non refundable license fees  funding of research and development activities  payments based upon achievement of development milestones and royalties in the form of a designated percentage of product sales or profits

table of contents arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
with the exception of royalties  these types of consideration are classified as development grant revenue in our consolidated statements of operations when revenue recognition is appropriate 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements  are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf we recognize up front license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have stand alone value or ii have stand alone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
for arrangements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting  total payments under the arrangement are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
the cumulative amount of revenue earned is limited to the cumulative amount of payments received as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential 
revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance 
deferred revenue amounts are classified as current liabilities to the extent that revenue is expected to be recognized within one year 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a development agreement with animas corporation which provided us with a development grant 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a collaboration agreement with edwards which provided us with a development grant  and we recognized million in revenue  which represents of our total revenues for the twelve months ending december  as of december   we had million in deferred revenue relating to our development agreements

 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  for periods beginning in fiscal in march  the securities and exchange commission issued sab relating to sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year our consolidated statement of operations as of and for the years ended december   and reflect the impact of 
table of contents sfas r 
share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding options that is expected to be recognized as a component of our operating expenses through compensation costs will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
prior to january   we had adopted the disclosure only provision of sfas accordingly  we had not previously recognized compensation expense  except for share based compensation expense accounted for in accordance with apb sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods as share based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
for the years ended december   and  the statement of operations included compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas and compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we changed our method of attributing the value of share based compensation to expense from the accelerated multiple option approach to the straight line single option method 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted on or prior to december  will continue to be recognized using the accelerated multiple option approach while compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  is recognized using the straight line single option method 
as share based compensation expense recognized in the statement of operations in fiscal is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in our pro forma information required under sfas for the periods prior to fiscal  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
as permitted by sfas r  we utilize the black scholes option pricing model as our method of valuation for share based awards granted 
the black scholes model was previously utilized for our pro forma information required under sfas our determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of the our employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas r using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we presented deferred compensation as a separate component of stockholders equity 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  on january  we reclassified the balance in deferred compensation to additional paid in capital on our balance sheet 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  for estimated excess  obsolete and potential scrapped inventories 
we estimate excess and obsolete inventories by identifying the amount of on hand and on order materials and 
table of contents comparing those to expected future sales for the next twelve months  taking into account clinical trial and development usage along with new product introductions on a part by part basis 
we utilize a standard cost system to track inventories on a part by part basis that approximates first in  first out 
if necessary  adjustments are made to the standard materials  standard labor and standard overhead costs to approximate actual labor and actual overhead costs 
the labor and overhead elements of our standard costs are based on full utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
clinical trial accounting we record accruals for estimated clinical study expenses  comprising payments for work performed by contract research organizations  physicians and participating hospitals 
these expenses can be a significant component of research and development expenses 
we accrue expenses for clinical studies performed by contract research organizations based on estimates of work performed under the contracts 
expenses for setting up clinical trial sites and study initiation are accrued immediately 
clinical expenses related to patient enrollment and ongoing monitoring are accrued as the trials progress 
warranty accrual we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time of shipment 
we estimate warranty accruals by analyzing the timing  cost and amount of returned product 
we evaluate assumptions and historical warranty experience on at least a quarterly basis to determine the continued appropriateness of such assumptions 
bonus accrual for the bonus plan  the compensation committee authorized an amount of up to of salary and wages for non sales employees to be awarded from the pool based on the weighted average achievement measured against certain objectives 
as targets were not met  no bonuses were paid under the bonus plan 
subsequently  the compensation committee approved discretionary bonuses totaling  and  in accrued bonuses were reversed during the fourth quarter of foreign currency the consolidated financial statements of the company s non us subsidiary  whose functional currency is the swedish krona  is translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
assets and liabilities are translated at period end exchange rates  and revenue and expense transactions are translated at average exchange rates for the period 
cumulative translation adjustments are recognized as part of comprehensive income and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet 
gains and losses on transactions denominated in other than the functional currency are reflected in operations 
restructuring charges in april  we entered into a lease for our current headquarters facility due to additional space requirements 
in the fourth quarter of  we exited our former headquarters facility after moving all operations to our new headquarters facility 
we have not yet entered into a sublease agreement for the former headquarters facility 
restructuring charges taken consist primarily of costs associated with permanently vacating our former headquarters facility 
we recorded  in additional rent related expense in the fourth quarter of relating to this restructuring  which is included in operating expenses and cost of sales in our consolidated statement of operations 
we account for facility exit costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which requires that a liability for such costs be recognized and measured initially at fair value on the cease use date based on remaining lease rentals  adjusted for the effects of any prepaid or deferred items recognized  reduced by the estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained even if it is not the intent to sublease 
as of december   accrued liabilities relating to this restructuring totaled  which includes  of deferred rent previously recorded for this property 

table of contents we are required to estimate future sublease income and future net operating expenses of the facilities  among other expenses 
the most significant of these estimates have related to the timing and extent of future sublease income in which to reduce lease obligations  and the probability for which the sublease income can be expected 
we have based estimates of sublease income  in part  on the opinions of independent real estate experts  current market conditions and rental rates  an assessment of the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made  and the location of the respective facility  among other factors 
further adjustments to the facility exit liability accrual will be required in future periods if actual exit costs or sublease income differ from amounts currently expected 
we will review the status of restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes to restructuring obligations in current operations based on management s most current estimates 
exit costs we record under these provisions are neither associated with  nor do they benefit  continuing activities 
income taxes in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of fin we adopted fin as of january  due to the valuation allowance  the adoption of fin did not impact our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as a result of the adoption  we recorded a net decrease to deferred tax assets of approximately million and a corresponding reduction to valuation allowance 
the following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits in thousands balance at january  increases related to current year tax positions balance at december  balance at january  increases related to current year tax positions balance at december  due to the valuation allowance  none of the unrecognized tax benefits as of december   would reduce our annual effective tax rate 
we do not expect unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next months 
we file income tax returns in the united states and in various state jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations 
due to net operating losses incurred  our tax returns from inception to date are subject to examination by taxing authorities 
our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 
as of december   we had no interest or penalties accrued for uncertain tax positions 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
in february  the fasb deferred the effective date of sfas by one year for certain non financial assets 
table of contents and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas  except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities for which the effective date has been delayed by one year 
the fair value hierarchy described by the standard is based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value and include the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the book values of cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values due to the short term nature of these instruments 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this standard permits us to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and established presentation and disclosure requirements 
in adopting this standard  we did not elect to measure any new assets or liabilities at their respective fair values 
in december  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf 
eitf requires collaborators to present the results of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
further  eitf clarified that the determination of whether transactions within a collaborative arrangement are part of a vendor customer or analogous relationship subject to eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
eitf will be effective for us beginning on january  the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement apb 
the fsp requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash or other assets on conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument 
the debt would be recognized at the present value of its cash flows discounted using the company s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
the equity component would be recognized as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair value of the liability 
the fsp also requires an accretion of the resultant debt discount over the expected life of the debt 
the transition guidance requires retrospective application to all periods presented  and does not grandfather existing instruments 
the effective date of the fsp is for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe the convertible debt issued in march falls under the fsp and we will be required to retroactively apply the guidance 
although we have not completed our analysis of the impact of this guidance  we believe the application would cause a reduction to the carrying value of the debt on our balance sheet and a corresponding increase in non cash interest expense to be recognized over the initial five year redemption period which could be significant 

table of contents in june  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 determining whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf 
eitf provides that we should use a two step approach to evaluate whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to our own stock  including evaluating the instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early application is not permitted 
we are assessing the potential impact of eitf on the financial condition and results of operations  but have not yet completed our analysis
