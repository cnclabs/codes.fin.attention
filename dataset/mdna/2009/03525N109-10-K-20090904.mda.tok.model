item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
factors that could cause such differences include those described in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading distributor of animal health products in the united states and canada 
we sell more than  products sourced from over  manufacturers to over  customers  as well as provide consultative services to our customers in the highly fragmented animal health products industry 
products we distribute include pharmaceuticals  vaccines  parasiticides  diagnostics  capital equipment  sanitizers  devices  supplies  and dairy lagoon treatment systems 
our principal customers are veterinarians  production animal operators and animal health product retailers 
we believe our customers purchase from us due to our longstanding relationships with them  knowledge of their businesses  service and ability to assist them in their operations 
we have a person sales force  including field sales representatives 
we process daily shipments from our central replenishment and distribution facility located in memphis  tennessee and distribution locations strategically located in the united states  canada and taiwan 
our corporate headquarters is located in the dallas fort worth metropolitan area 
key factors and trends that have affected and we believe will continue to affect our operating results include overall growth in the dairy industry 
according to the usda over the last several years the demand for dairy products has increased 
as a result  the demand for production animal health products in the dairy market has increased 
we have capitalized on this demand with increased sales of our dairy related production animal health products 
we anticipate that this trend of growth in the dairy market will continue in the future and that we will be able to fulfill the corresponding demand for related production animal health products  resulting in increased sales 
notwithstanding the overall historical trend  recently  the significant supply of dairy products  combined with soft demand due to the general economic downturn has decreased the profitability of our dairy customers 
our dairy customer s declining profitability has caused them to limit their spending on dairy related production animal health products  resulting in decreased sales 
consolidation by our customers in the dairy industry 
the dairy market is undergoing significant consolidation resulting in a shift towards larger operations 
according to the usda  dairies with or more cattle currently account for of the milk producing cow population in the united states  as compared to in over the last several years we have leveraged our relationships with larger dairies and our national footprint to gain market share in the dairy related production animal health products market 
we anticipate that this trend of dairy consolidation will continue and we will seek to continue to gain market share 
increased focus on companion animal customers 
according to sundale research  over the last several years the market for companion animal health products has increased to approximately billion 
we believe this growth has been and will continue to be driven by the following trends widespread ownership of companion animals  increased importance of companion animals in households  growing awareness of companion animal health and wellness  technology migration from the human life science product sector into the practice of veterinary medicine  increased marketing programs sponsored by large pharmaceutical and companion animal nutrition companies  and prolonged companion animal life spans creating demand for geriatric companion animal care products 
over the past three years  we have begun to penetrate the urban and suburban veterinarian markets 
we believe that by leveraging our centralized procurement and inventory management model we are well positioned to develop a leading cost to serve position in the companion animal health products market and to continue to capture market share  resulting in increased sales and profitability 
while we believe we are a leader in the companion animal health product market  the market is highly fragmented with numerous national  regional and local distributors  and a few of our competitors with bigger market share have greater financial and other resources than we do 
changes in consumer preferences 
the demand for production animal health products is heavily dependent upon consumer demand for beef  dairy  poultry and swine 
the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends  demands and preferences 
for example  changes in consumer diets may negatively affect consumer demand for beef  dairy  poultry or swine  and therefore reduce the demand for our production animal health products 
during the previous downturns in these markets  we experienced declines in sales 
we generate revenue from our customers in three ways 
over of our revenue is generated through buy sell transactions 
the remainder comes from consignment and agency transactions 
in the buy sell transactions  we take title to inventory from our manufacturers 
we sell products to customers and invoice them 
buy sell transactions are advantageous to us over other sales methods because we take title to the inventory and are able to promote these products on behalf of manufacturers and effectively manage the pricing and distribution of these products 
for our consignment sales  we do not take title to the products  but we do stock and ship products to  and invoice customers 
for our agency sales  we transmit orders from our customers to our manufacturers 
the manufacturer ships the product directly to our customers and compensates us with a commission payment for handling the order from our customer and providing customer service 
manufacturers may occasionally switch between the buy sell and agency methods for particular products 
currently and for the past three fiscal years  only one product with material sales has required treatment as a consignment sale 
contracts with manufacturers are generally negotiated annually on a calendar year basis 
sales growth goals are negotiated and used to determine rebate achievement 
manufacturer rebates are classified in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a reduction of direct cost of products sold 
manufacturer rebates that are based on quarterly  trimester or annual goals have sales performance tracked continually versus the goal  and rebate income is adjusted accordingly when minimum hurdles are achieved 
results of operations the following table summarizes historical results of operations for the period from july  to june   on an actual basis and as a percentage of net sales 
our gross profit may not be comparable to those of other entities  since some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold and others  like us  report non direct costs in selling  general  and administrative expenses  and salaries  wages  commissions  and related benefits 
further  the cost of our operations may not decline as rapidly as our decline in net sales  negatively impacting our profitability 
summary consolidated results of operations table year ended june  dollars in thousands net sales direct cost of products sold gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses includes salary  wages  commission  and related benefits acquisition costs depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment  operating income loss other income expense interest expense other income income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss net sales direct cost of products sold gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses includes salary  wages  commission  and related benefits acquisition costs depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment operating income loss other income expense interest expense other income income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to lower spending by production animal customers whose profits have been constrained by fluctuating commodity prices and the general economic slowdown  and was partially offset by million of incremental sales from the acquisition of kane veterinary supplies  ltd 
kane in the second quarter of fiscal the number of field sales representatives decreased to as of june   from as of june   primarily as a result of consolidation of underperforming sales territories 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  gross profit as a percentage of sales was for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june  the decrease in gross profit resulted from the decline in sales combined with lower gross profit margins driven by declines in manufacturer rebates 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in variable selling and distribution expenses driven by lower sales volume combined with cost reduction efforts  partially offset by the million bad debt provision resulting from a dispute with a manufacturer regarding a rebate receivable and million of accelerated stock option expenses resulting from the may voluntary forfeiture of million options by senior management 
the million bad debt provision  million of accelerated stock option expenses  and the fixed nature of certain expenses such as salaries  rent  and computer related costs drove an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from for the year ended june   to for the year ended june  without the million bad debt provision and the million of accelerated stock option expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales would have totaled for the year ended june  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the increase results primarily from increased amortization of intangible assets driven by purchase price allocations for the acquisition of kane 
goodwill impairment 
the company s stock price and market capitalization declined significantly in the past year  and the company experienced no growth in the current year and anticipates slower growth rates in the future 
these factors are significant to the annual impairment test  and as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million as of june   to reduce the carrying value of goodwill 
other expenses 
other expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the decrease in other expenses was due to a decrease in interest expense of million to million in the year ended june   as compared to million in the year ended june  this decrease was due to lower average interest rates and less debt outstanding than in the prior year 
income tax expenses 
income tax expense decreased million to a tax benefit of million for the year ended june   from a million tax expense for the year ended june  excluding permanent differences resulting from goodwill impairment  stock based compensation and other non deductable items  the adjusted effective tax rate was and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to million  or  of sales from seven acquisitions completed during the second  third and fourth quarters of and the second quarter of  the addition of new customers  continued expansion into new territories  and increased sales to existing customers 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the increase in gross profit resulted from sales growth  but was partially offset by a reduction in vendor rebates 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was due to a reduction in vendor rebates 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the increase was the result of an increase in variable selling and distribution expenses driven by sales volume combined with million of increased sarbanes oxley section implementation costs  million of increased public company related expenses  million of increased stock option expenses  million of severance obligations accrued primarily for the company s former senior vice president and chief operating officer  and million of increased health care costs  all partially offset by the inclusion in the prior year of million of non recurring legal expenses related to the settlement of a dispute with a vendor 
the fixed nature of other corporate expenses helped to offset these increases  resulting in only a slight increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from for the year ended june   to for the year ended june  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the increase results primarily from increased amortization of intangible assets driven by the acquisition of kane in the second quarter of fiscal and adjustments to the purchase price allocations of the acquisitions completed during the second  third  and fourth quarters of other expenses 
other expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the decrease in other expenses was due to a decrease in interest expense of million to million in the year ended june   as compared to million in the year ended june  this decrease was due to million of debt issue cost write offs and early extinguishment penalties incurred in the year ended june  as compared to million of debt issue cost write offs in the year ended june   combined with lower interest rates and decreased debt outstanding following the company s initial public offering 
income tax expenses 
income tax expense increased million to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the effective tax rate was and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in the canadian tax rate in the year ended june   combined with an unfavorable blended state tax rate in the year ended june  seasonality of operating results historically  our quarterly sales and operating results have varied significantly  and will likely continue to do so in the future 
seasonality has been caused by product usage  climate changes  promotions  rebates and announced price increases 
historically  sales have been higher during the spring and fall months due to increased sales of production animal health products 
the transportation of production animals during the spring and fall months drives seasonal product usage 
the transportation of production animals occurs during various times in the animal s life cycle 
the cycle begins with the cow calf stage where the calf is born and raised to six to eight months of age 
at that point the calf moves to pasture for three to five months 
the last movement occurs when the animal is placed in the feedyard 
movement and climate changes cause stress upon the animal  which increases the risk of disease 
thus  prior to each of these moves  the animal is typically treated for disease prevention 
these buying patterns can also be affected by manufacturers and distributors marketing programs launched during the summer months  particularly in june  which can cause customers to purchase production animal health products in advance of actual usage 
this kind of early purchasing may reduce the sales in the months these purchases typically would have been made 
in the companion animal health products market  sales of flea  tick and heartworm products drive sales during the spring and summer months 
see risk factors our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to factors outside of management s control 
additionally  while we accrue rebates as they are earned  our rebates have historically been highest during the quarter ended december  since some of our manufacturers rebate programs are designed to include targets to be achieved on calendar year sales 
we anticipate that this trend with respect to manufacturers rebate programs will continue  but just as in the fourth calendar quarter of  we do not believe that it will have as strong an impact upon the quarter ended december   as it has in prior years due to manufacturers shifting growth goals from annual to quarterly or trimester goals and the elimination of an annual rebate program by a key vendor 
for the reasons and factors discussed above  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year  and our sales for any particular future period may decrease 
in the future  operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of our stock would likely decrease 
consolidated statements of operations for the quarter unaudited september  december  march  june  september  december  march  june  in thousands net sales direct cost of products sold gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses acquisition costs depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment operating income loss other income expense other income interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss includes salaries  wages  commissions  and related benefits 
the decline in sales during the fourth quarter of was primarily attributable to lower spending by production animal customers whose profits have been constrained by fluctuating commodity prices and the general economic slowdown 
the decrease in gross profit during the fourth quarter of resulted from the decline in sales combined with lower gross profit margins driven by declines in manufacturer rebates 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during the fourth quarter of was the result of the million bad debt provision and million of accelerated expense driven by the voluntary forfeiture of options by senior management  both partially offset by a decrease in variable selling and distribution expenses driven by lower sales volume combined with cost reduction efforts 
the company s stock price and market capitalization declined significantly in the past year  and the company experienced no growth in the current year and anticipates slower growth rates in the future 
these factors are significant to the annual impairment test  and as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million as of june   to reduce the carrying value of goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
funds are expended to provide working capital that enables the company to maintain adequate inventory levels to promptly fulfill customer needs and expand operations 
the company expects its capital resources to be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months  and it expects cash flows from operations to be sufficient to reduce outstanding borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
operating activities 
for the year ended june   net cash provided by operating activities was million  and was primarily attributable to a decrease in working capital of million and million of net non cash costs  partially offset by million of net losses and a change in deferred income taxes of million 
the change in working capital included a decrease in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in inventories of million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable resulted from a decline in sales from the prior year 
the decrease in inventories resulted from the decline in sales that caused a reduction in purchasing and drove the corresponding decrease in accounts payable 
the non cash costs included million of goodwill impairment  million of depreciation and amortization  million of debt issue cost amortization  million of bad debt expense  and million of stock based compensation 
the bad debt expense included a million provision resulting from a dispute with a manufacturer regarding a rebate receivable

the non cash costs included million of depreciation and amortization  million of debt issue cost amortization  million of bad debt expense  and million of stock based compensation 
the debt issue cost amortization includes the write off of of debt issue costs resulting from the august refinancing of the term loan debt 
the change in working capital included a decrease in accounts payable of million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of million 
the decrease in accounts payable resulted primarily from a shift in purchasing to vendors with shorter payment terms 
the decrease in accrued liabilities resulted primarily from payments of income tax accruals  liabilities related to acquisitions  and accrued non recurring legal expenses related to the july settlement of a dispute with a vendor 
for the year ended june   net cash provided by operating activities was million  and was primarily attributable to million in net income and million of non cash costs  offset by a change in deferred income taxes of million and an increase in working capital of million 
the non cash costs included million of depreciation and amortization and million of debt issue cost amortization 
the debt issue cost amortization includes the write off of million of debt issue costs resulting from the pay off of the second lien notes 
the change in working capital included an increase in inventories of million and changes in income tax receivables payables of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of million 
the increase in inventories resulted from a rise in inventory purchases that drove the corresponding increase in accounts payable 
the change in income tax receivables payables resulted from estimated tax payments partially offset by income tax accruals 
investing activities 
for the year ended june   net cash used for investing activities was million  and was primarily attributable to million of purchases of property  plant and equipment  and million of purchase price adjustments primarily related to the acquisition of kane in the second quarter of fiscal  partially offset by million of collections on notes receivable and million of proceeds from the sale of property  plant  and equipment 
for the year ended june   net cash used for investing activities was million  and was primarily attributable to million  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of kane  million of purchases of property  plant and equipment  and million of purchase price adjustments related to acquisitions completed in the prior year  all partially offset by of proceeds from the sale of property  plant  and equipment

a change in overdraft balances totaling million accounted for the remainder of the increase in net cash provided by financing activities 
capital resources

as of june   the interest rates for the revolver ranged from to  and the interest rate for the first lien term loan was 
additionally  the company is required to pay a commitment fee on the daily unused amount of the revolver at a per annum rate of 
the credit agreements contain certain covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make certain payments  sell assets  enter into certain transactions with affiliates and create liens 
moreover  certain of these agreements require us to maintain specified financial ratios 
the most restrictive covenant relates to the creation or assumption of additional indebtedness 
the company was in compliance with all financial covenants at june  the company utilizes cash flow hedge accounting and uses derivative financial instruments to effectively convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
on april   the company entered into a million notional value swap transaction with a financial institution effective april  the company receives a floating rate based on libor and pays a fixed rate of 
the swap agreement terminates on june  as of june   the fair value of this swap was a net liability of million

the swap agreement terminates on may  as of june   the fair value of this swap was a net liability of million 
swap agreement fair values are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of current portion of long term debt 
the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements were estimated based on current settlement prices and quoted market prices of comparable contracts 
the company calculated no ineffectiveness on the interest rate swap agreements at june  and an unrealized loss of million  net of taxes of million  is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the market values of the interest rate swap agreements recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss may be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations if certain terms in the revolver or new term note change  if the revolver or new term note are extinguished  or if the interest rate swap agreements are terminated prior to maturity 
the net receipts or payments from the interest rate swap agreements are recorded in interest expense 
during the years ended june  and  changes in the fair values of interest rate swap agreements totaled million and million  respectively  and the company reclassified million and million  respectively  from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to interest expense 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating lease commitments in the contractual obligations table below 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of june  mature as follows payments due by period in thousands total year or less more than year years more than year years more than years revolver operating lease commitments long term debt and interest rate swap obligations including current portion interest on long term debt and line of credit total contractual obligations future interest payments are calculated based on the assumption that all debt is outstanding until maturity 
for debt instruments with variable interest rates  interest has been calculated for all future periods using the rates in effect as of june  the company is subject to purchase obligations under certain of its purchase contracts  but management does not believe that they are material 
inflation most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on freight and fuel costs  employee wages and costs of products 
historically  we have been proactive in addressing inflation in attempts to limit its effects through the enactment of cost control initiatives 
critical accounting policies the sec has issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  our management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following are descriptions of our critical accounting policies that are impacted by such judgments  assumptions and estimates revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title passes according to shipping terms 
provision for sales returns is recorded at the time of sale for estimated products returned by customers 
provision for sales discounts is recorded at the time of sale 
revenues are presented net of sales taxes collected from retail customers and remitted to government taxing authorities 
manufacturer rebates 
inventory rebates are recognized when estimable and probable and include inventory purchase rebates and sales related rebates 
inventory purchase rebates received are capitalized into inventory while sales related rebates are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 
we expect that our future estimates will continue to be reasonable as our rebates are based upon specific vendor program goals and are recorded each month based principally upon achievement of sales performance measures 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts to allow for any amounts which may be unrecoverable 
this allowance is adjusted as necessary to reserve for specific rebates that are deemed to be uncollectible 
goodwill and other intangibles 
intangibles assets include nonamortizing goodwill and trademarks and trade names and amortizing customer relationships and noncompete agreements  which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of twelve and eight years  respectively 
the company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may exceed its fair value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in the company s expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in the company s stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  and slower growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets and could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
at june   the company performed its annual impairment test and determined that no impairment had occurred 
at december   the company s stock price and market capitalization had declined significantly from june   and the company had experienced no growth during that six month period 
as a result  the company concluded that indicators had emerged that required impairment testing to be performed at december  accordingly  the company performed an interim test of impairment 
the fair value of the company was estimated utilizing the income approach to derive an enterprise value of the company 
this income approach was validated by comparing the fair value to fair value estimates using a market approach 
the market approach included the determination that the company s stock price at december   did not reflect a control premium that was considered in deriving the enterprise value 
based upon the results of this testing  the company concluded that no impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets existed at december  at june   the company performed its annual impairment test 
the company s stock price and market capitalization remained low  and the company experienced no growth in the current year and anticipated slower growth rates in the future 
the fair value of the company was estimated utilizing the income approach to derive an enterprise value of the company 
this income approach was validated by comparing the fair value to fair value estimates using a market approach 
the market approach included the determination that the company s stock price at june   did not reflect a control premium that was considered in deriving the enterprise value 
based upon the results of this testing  the company concluded that no impairment of customer relationships  noncompete agreements  or trademarks and trade names existed at june   however  the carrying value of goodwill exceeded its fair value  and the company recorded a million impairment charge as of june  the company will continue to evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment based upon any changes to the company s operations or its operating business environment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exposure to interest rates the company is exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
as part of our financial risk management program  we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for speculative purposes and therefore holds no derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to variable interest rates on borrowings under the company s credit agreements 
during april  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements at an interest rate of on million of its debt in order to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to these borrowings 
this interest rate swap effectively converted million of debt from floating to fixed interest rates 
at june   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a net liability of million 
at june   million of the company s debt remained subject to market risk for changes in interest rates 
if the weighted average interest rate on the company s remaining variable rate indebtedness rose basis points a change from the calculated weighted average interest rate as of june   assuming no change in the company s outstanding balance under its revolver and million first lien term loan  the company s annualized income before taxes and cash flows from operating activities would decline by approximately million 
if the weighted average interest rate on the company s remaining variable rate indebtedness decreased basis points a change from the calculated weighted average interest rate as of june   assuming no change in the company s outstanding balance under its revolver and million first lien term loan  the company s annualized income before taxes and cash flows from operating activities would increase by approximately million 
exposure to exchange rates our subsidiaries are located in canada and taiwan 
due to the relative low volume of payments made by us through these subsidiaries  we do not believe that we have significant exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign currency exchange risks 
we continue to review this issue and may consider hedging certain foreign exchange risks through the use of currency futures or options in future years
