item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations debt 
the fair value of some of this debt is greater than the book value 
as such  if market rates of interest increase by  or approximately basis points  the fair value of our fixed rate debt would increase by approximately million 
if market rates of interest decrease by  or basis points  the fair value of our fixed rate debt would increase by million 

table of contents interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments and future cash flows 
these analyses do not consider the effect of a reduced level of overall economic activity 
if overall economic activity is significantly reduced  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure 
however  because we cannot determine the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 
currency exchange risk as we have international operations with our two london hotels  currency exchange risk between the us dollar and the british pound arises as a normal part of our business 
we reduce this risk by transacting this business in british pounds 
a change in prevailing rates would have  however  an impact on the value of our equity in morgans europe 
the us dollar british pound currency exchange is currently the only currency exchange rate to which we are directly exposed 
generally  we do not enter into forward or option contracts to manage our exposure applicable to net operating cash flows 
we do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future 
historically  we have not repatriated earnings from our london hotels because of our historical net losses in our united kingdom operations and our joint venture agreement 
during  we repatriated approximately million in cash dividends from the recapitalization of our london joint venture 
the recapitalization required the consent of the lender and allows for future dividends from profits subject to lender consent
