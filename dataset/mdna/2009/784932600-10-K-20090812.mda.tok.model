introduction the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide readers with an understanding of saba 
the following are included in our md a overview  critical accounting policies  results of operations  and liquidity and capital resources 
overview general we help organizations manage their most important asset their people 
we provide the premier software platform for enterprise learning  collaboration  performance  and talent management  as well as license updates and product support  ondemand  implementation  training  and consulting services 
our people management solutions drive organizational excellence by bringing a disciplined approach to aligning  developing  and managing people across the entire organization 
by using saba to manage their extended workforce  our customers achieve demonstrably higher levels of performance through increased productivity  sales and service effectiveness reduced personnel development and training costs improved organizational agility and execution our solutions help our customers through the implementation of a management system for aligning goals  developing and motivating people and measuring results 
by implementing our solutions  organizations are better equipped to align their workforce around the organization s business objectives  effectively manage growing regulatory requirements  increase sales and channel readiness  accelerate the productivity of new people joining the extended enterprise of employees  customers  partners  and suppliers  increase both the speed of customer acquisition and long term customer loyalty  shorten time to market of new products  and improve visibility into organizational performance 
background we commenced operations in april and  through march  focused substantially all of our efforts on research activities  developing our products and building our business infrastructure 
we delivered our first saba enterprise learning products and began to generate revenues from software license fees  implementation and consulting services fees and support fees in april 
table of contents on may   we completed the acquisition of thinq learning solutions  inc thinq  a provider of enterprise learning management solutions which allowed us to expand our customer base and provided greater scale to increase our investment in research and development to accelerate innovation and increase stockholder value 
on january   we completed the acquisition of centra software  inc centra  a provider of online learning and training software and services 
we believe our acquisition of centra strengthened our competitive position in the human capital management market and provided us with a broader and deeper product offering 
in addition  as a result of the acquisition our customer base substantially increased 
the centra acquisition included total purchase consideration of million 
we have included the results of operations of centra in our consolidated financial statements beginning february  our corporate headquarters are located in redwood shores  california 
we have an international presence in australia  brazil  canada  france  germany  india  japan  mexico  new zealand  singapore and the united kingdom through which we conduct various operating activities related to our business 
in each of the non us jurisdictions in which we have subsidiaries  other than india  we have employees or consultants engaged in sales and services activities 
in the case of our india subsidiary  our employees primarily engage in software development and quality assurance testing activities 
sources of revenue we generate revenues from the sale of software licenses  ondemand services  annual license updates and product support and professional services 
software licenses we license our software solutions in multiple element arrangements that include a combination of our software  license updates and product support and or professional services 
a significant amount of our license sales are for perpetual licenses 
to date  a substantial majority of our software license revenue has been derived from the saba learning product suite 
for the foreseeable future  we expect the saba enterprise suite and saba centra product suite to generate substantially all of our software license revenues 
our license revenue is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions  as well as customers budgetary cycles and the competitive position of our software products 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is long  typically six to months 
the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenue 
ondemand ondemand revenue includes revenue derived from term based managed application services 
these services are provided pursuant to customer agreements with terms typically ranging from one to three years 
the associated ondemand revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
our ondemand revenue depends on both our sales of additional ondemand services and renewals of existing ondemand service agreements 
we believe that ondemand revenue will grow for the foreseeable future as we anticipate that a substantial majority of our customers will renew their contracts on expiration and that we will continue to add new ondemand customers 
licenses updates and product support license updates and product support includes the right to receive future unspecified updates for the applicable software product and technical support 
we typically sell license updates and product support for an initial period of one year concurrently with the sale of the related software license 
after the initial period  license updates and product support are renewable on an annual basis at the option of the customer 
our license updates 
table of contents and product support revenue depends upon both our sales of additional software licenses and annual renewals of existing license updates and product support agreements 
we believe that license updates and product support revenue will grow steadily for the foreseeable future as we anticipate that a substantial majority of our customers will renew their annual contracts and the sale of new software licenses will increase the number of customers that purchase license updates and product support 
professional services our professional services business consists of consulting  education and strategic services 
consulting and education services are typically provided to customers that license software directly from us 
these consulting and education services are generally provided over a period of three to nine months after licensing the software 
generally  consulting services related to software implementations are not considered essential to the functionality of the software 
our consulting and education services revenue varies directly with the levels of license revenue and new ondemand service bookings generated from our direct sales organization in the preceding three to nine month period 
in addition  our consulting and education services revenue varies following our commercial release of significant software updates as our customers generally engage our services to assist with the implementation of their software update 
we provide consulting services on a time and materials basis and on a fixed fee basis 
strategic services are less dependent than consulting and education services on the sale of our licenses 
strategic services present additional opportunities that arise at different times throughout a customer life cycle 
in arrangements that include professional services and ondemand offerings  but not a license of our software  we recognize revenue for professional services as the services are performed if these professional services qualify as a separate element of the arrangement 
if the professional services do not qualify as a separate element of the arrangement  the related revenue is combined with the ondemand revenue and recognized ratably over the ondemand service period 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue primarily consists of compensation  employee benefits and out of pocket travel related expenses for our employees  including our ondemand and license update and product support personnel  and the fees of third party subcontractors  who provide professional services to our clients 
additionally  costs of revenue also includes external hosting fees and depreciation and amortization charges on the necessary ondemand infrastructure  third party license royalty costs  and overhead allocated based on headcount and reimbursed expenses 
the amortization of acquired developed technology  comprised of the ratable amortization of technological assets acquired in the acquisition of centra software  inc in  is also included in the cost of revenue 
many factors affect our cost of revenue  including changes in the mix of products and services  pricing trends and changes in the amount of reimbursed expenses 
because cost as a percentage of revenues is higher for services than for software licenses  an increase in services  including ondemand services  as a percentage of our total revenue would reduce gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
additionally  when our professional services revenue is combined with our ondemand subscription revenue  we defer the direct costs related to the professional services and recognize them ratably over the applicable ondemand service period 
we categorize deferred revenue and deferred costs on our consolidated balance sheet as current if we expect to recognize such revenue or cost within the following months 
as of may   the deferred balance of the professional services revenue related to such ondemand offerings and the related deferred costs was million and million  respectively 
when the revenue from professional services is recognized ratably over the ondemand subscription service period  we allocate the revenue to professional services revenue and to ondemand revenue based on the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for similar professional services that qualify as a separate element of the arrangement 
our judgment as to whether the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and our results of operations 

table of contents operating expenses we classify all operating expenses  except amortization of purchased intangible assets and in process research and development  to the research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expense categories based on the nature of the expenses 
each of these three categories includes commonly recurring expenses such as salaries including stock based compensation  employee benefits  travel and entertainment costs  and allocated communication  rent and depreciation costs 
we allocate communication  rent and depreciation costs to each of the functional areas that derive a benefit from such costs based upon their respective headcounts 
the sales and marketing category of operating expenses also includes sales commissions and expenses related to public relations and advertising  trade shows and marketing collateral materials 
the general and administrative category of operating expenses also includes allowances for doubtful accounts and administrative and professional services fees 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and restructuring costs 
we have reviewed the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs with the audit committee 
revenue recognition 
we recognize license revenues addressed below in accordance with the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  as amended  we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
sop  as amended  requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
we have analyzed each element in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vendor specific objective evidence vsoe to allocate revenues to certain ondemand offerings  license updates and product support and professional services 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately  price charged upon renewal or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
license revenues from licenses with a term of three years or more are generally recognized on delivery if the other conditions of sop are satisfied 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return and we do not 
table of contents recognize revenue from resellers until an end user has been identified and the other conditions of sop are satisfied 
license revenues from licenses with a term of less than three years are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
license updates and product support revenue is also recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically months 
in arrangements where term licenses are bundled with license updates and product support and such revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  we allocate the revenue to license revenue and to license updates and product support revenue based on the vsoe of fair value for license updates and product support revenue on perpetual license of similar products 
revenue related to professional services is generally recognized as the services are performed 
although we provide professional services on a time and materials basis  a portion of these services is provided on a fixed fee basis 
for services performed on a fixed fee basis  revenues are generally recognized on the proportional performance of the project  with performance measured based on hours of work performed 
for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and services revenues are recognized over the service delivery period using the percentage of completion method or  if we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to complete the services  we use the completed contract method of accounting in accordance with sop and relevant guidance of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
a contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred and the item has been accepted by the customer 
revenue from our ondemand offerings is recognized as a service arrangement whereby the revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement or on an as used basis if defined in the contract 
certain of our ondemand offerings are integrated offerings pursuant to which the customers ability to access our software is not separable from the services necessary to operate the software and customers are not allowed to take possession of our software  in which case revenue is recognized under the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
our ondemand offerings also include arrangements with customers that have separately licensed and taken possession of our software 
when these ondemand offerings are part of a multiple element arrangement involving licenses  we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  when the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
application of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware criteria is met 
in arrangements that include professional services and ondemand offerings  but not a license of our software  we recognize revenue for professional services as the services are performed if these professional services qualify as a separate element of the arrangement 
if the professional services do not qualify as a separate element of the arrangement  the professional services revenue is combined with the ondemand subscription revenue and recognized ratably over the ondemand subscription service period 
additionally  we defer the direct costs related to the professional services and recognize them ratably over the applicable ondemand service period 
we categorize deferred revenue and deferred costs on our consolidated balance sheet as current if we expect to recognize such revenue or cost within the following twelve months 
when the revenue from professional services is recognized ratably over the subscription service period  we allocate the revenue to professional services revenue and to ondemand revenue based on the vsoe of fair value for similar professional services that qualify as a separate element of the arrangement 
our judgment as to whether the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts and totaled million as of may  the allowance for doubtful accounts  which totaled million as of may   is based on our assessment of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on the aging of the accounts receivable  the financial condition of our customers and their payment history  our historical write off experience and other assumptions 
past due balances based on purchase order terms and other specific accounts as necessary are reviewed monthly 
account 
table of contents balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we account for goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our goodwill balance at may  was million  including million and million recorded as a result of our acquisitions of centra and thinq  respectively 
we account for purchased intangible assets under sfas no 
 accounting for the impaired of disposal of long lived assets 
amortization of purchased intangible assets  including acquired developed technology  was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal as of may   our purchased intangible assets balance was million  net of accumulated amortization 
the total expected future amortization related to purchased intangible assets will be approximately million  million and million in fiscal years through  respectively 
sfas no 
prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase screens for impairment  while the second phase  if necessary  measures the impairment 
we consider saba to be a single reporting unit 
accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company 
we perform the required impairment analysis of goodwill annually or on a more frequent basis if indicators or impairment arise or circumstances otherwise dictate 
a significant and extended reduction in our enterprise fair value to below the recorded amount of our stockholders equity could indicate a change in our business climate and under sfas  we could be required to write down the carrying value of our goodwill and record an expense for an impairment loss 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review our long lived asset groups  including property and equipment and other intangibles  for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
fair value measurements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
sfas no 
establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities  level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly and indirectly  such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  or level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 

table of contents financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  excluding accrued interest components consisted of the following types of instruments as of may  level input is defined above fair value measurements using input type level in thousands assets money market funds included in cash equivalents total financial assets our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our money market funds were derived from quoted market prices 
restructuring costs 
the total accrued restructuring balance as of may  was  which across all functions consisted primarily of severance and fringe benefits associated with the elimination of positions during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal any changes to the estimates will be reflected in future results of operations  and it could materially affect our accrual 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our results of operations in the period this was determined and may be recorded as a credit to restructuring costs 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional charge would have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations in the period this was determined 
share based compensation 
on june   we adopted sfas r  share based payment  under the modified prospective method 
sfas r generally requires share based payments to employees to be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values 
prior to june   we accounted for our share based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting as defined by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and applied the disclosure provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended 
under apb  we generally did not recognize any compensation expense for stock options granted to employees or outside directors as the exercise price of our options was equivalent to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
for pro forma disclosures of share based compensation prior to june   the estimated fair values for options granted and options assumed were amortized using the accelerated expense attribution method 
in addition  we reduced pro forma share based compensation expense for actual forfeitures in the periods they occurred 
in march  the sec issued sab  which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas r 
we applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
upon our adoption of sfas r  we were required to estimate the awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce share based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience  forfeitures in the future may differ 
under sfas r  the forfeiture rate must be revised if actual forfeitures differ from our original estimates 
also in connection with our adoption of sfas r  we elected to recognize awards granted after our adoption date under the straight line amortization method 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using the black scholes merton bsm pricing model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options 
for restricted stock units or rsus  which provide for shares to be issued upon the lapse of vesting conditions  stock compensation is calculated based on the fair 
table of contents market value of the stock on the award date 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon united states treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock based upon our historical stock price volatility over the length of the expected term of the stock option 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
beginning in our fiscal year  sfas r required the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax effected compensation that would have been recognized as if we had always accounted for our stock based award activity under sfas r to be reported as a cash flow from financing activities  rather than as a cash flow from operating activities  as was prescribed under accounting rules applicable to our fiscal year and prior 
as we do not expect to realize any of these benefits  due to operating losses  no such amounts have been recorded through may  to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs and refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded during our fiscal reporting periods 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment  and segregating foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation  and determining required intercompany revenue sharing  cost reimbursement and other transfer pricing arrangements among related entities 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carry forwards and stock based compensation deductions 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we consider future growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
we maintain a full valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
a portion of the valuation allowance pertains to deferred tax assets established in connection with prior acquisitions  and to the extent that this portion of the valuation allowance is reversed in fiscal  goodwill will likely be adjusted 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment that could become subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 

table of contents on june   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit assuming that all issues are audited and resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes are considered 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  expiration of statutes of limitation on potential assessments or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made 
our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties 
business combinations 
as part of our accounting for business combinations  some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the quarter any impairment is recorded 
amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure  however  deferred taxes have been recorded for non deductible amortization expenses as a part of the purchase price allocation process 
we have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions  including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates  in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities 
income tax contingencies existing as of the acquisition dates of the acquired companies are evaluated quarterly and any adjustments are recorded as adjustments to goodwill 
under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  business combinations  any future adjustments will be recorded as tax expense or benefit beginning with the company s three month period ending august  results of operations years ended may   and revenues years ended may  percent of total revenues may  percent of total revenues may  percent of total revenues in thousands revenues license license updates and product support ondemand professional services total revenues total revenues decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal and increased during fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  and  no customer represented more than of total revenues 
as a percentage of total revenues  revenues from customers outside the united states represented approximately for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the only country outside the united states that consisted of more than of total revenue was the united kingdom  which represented for fiscal and for both fiscal and fiscal 
table of contents license revenue 
license revenue decreased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal license revenue decreased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal these decreases were caused by a shift from sales of licenses to ondemand services and  in addition with respect to fiscal  a decrease in new licenses and renewed licenses as a result of the recessionary economic environment 
license updates and product support revenue 
license updates and product support revenue decreased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was attributable in part to a stronger dollar during over  in addition to product support revenue recognized during fiscal which included a favorable impact of approximately million due to renewals for major customers that were renewed after the contracts expired 
we recognize the portion of revenue associated with the period that has lapsed upon renewal 
license updates and product support revenue increased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the ratable recognition of the full contract value of license updates and product support renewals from former centra customers and to the sale of new and renewal license updates and product support contracts to our growing customer base 
ondemand revenue 
ondemand revenue increased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase in ondemand revenue was primarily attributable to a high rate of ondemand renewals  increased demand for saba enterprise ondemand offerings including a shift from license revenue 
ondemand revenue increased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in ondemand revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in customer demand for these offerings from both existing and new customers as well as the ratable recognition of the full contract value of ondemand renewals from former centra customers 
professional services revenue 
professional services revenue decreased  or less than  during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was slight  despite the negative impact of the recessionary environment  since it was offset by higher demand for our consulting services for upgrades and expansions from our existing customer base 
professional services revenue increased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased demand for our consulting services for our expanded customer base 
international revenues as a percentage of total revenues and the mix of license and services revenues as a percentage of total revenues have varied significantly primarily due to variability in new license sales

cost of license revenue increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in third party royalty costs 
license revenue gross margins decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to the decrease of product volume relative to fixed expenses 
cost of license revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal license revenue gross margins increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in third party royalty costs and higher costs of license revenue during fiscal due to the million write off of a prepaid royalty related to technology that we will not use in future offerings 
cost of license updates and product support revenue 
cost of license updates and product support revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to salaries and related expenses of million through reduced headcount as result of attrition and restructuring and a decrease in travel related expenses of million 
license updates and product support gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross margins was primarily due to cost reductions when compared to the prior period 
cost of license updates and product support revenue increased 
table of contents million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to salaries and related expenses attributable to additional headcount needed to support the infrastructure of the growing installed customer base 
license updates and product support gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the ratable recognition of the full contract value of license updates and product support renewals from former centra customers 
cost of ondemand revenue 
cost of ondemand revenue increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to increases in third party co location and connectivity fees of million  salaries and related expenses of million and infrastructure fees of million including depreciation and amortization of computer hardware and software  associated with supporting our growing ondemand business

table of contents our results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if revenues fall below our expectations  we may not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to the shortfall and operating losses will increase 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience long sales cycles 
therefore  the timing of future customer contracts could be difficult to predict  making it difficult to estimate revenues between quarters 
factors that could affect our quarterly operating results are described under the caption item a risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources years ended may  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents we have funded our operations through operating activities and our most significant source of operating cash flows stems from customer purchases of our license  license updates and product support  ondemand and professional services

on july   we entered into a new credit facility with a bank 
the terms of the credit facility are described further below under the heading contractual obligations and commitments 
we may use some of our cash balance or draw amounts under the credit facility to fund acquisitions of technology  products or businesses 
cash provided by used in operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal the increase in fiscal is primarily a result of adjusting our net loss of million for non cash expenses related to stock based compensation of million  depreciation and amortization of million  as well as an increase in deferred revenue of million  adjustment of goodwill of million  and decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million  and accounts receivable of million 
these increases and decreases to our cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million and a decrease in accrued expenses of million

total accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso  based on a rolling four quarter calculation  was days at may  compared to days at may  and days at may  changes in accounts receivable have a significant impact on our cash flow 
items that can affect our accounts receivable dso include timing of license revenue and the proportion of that license revenue relative to our other types of revenue  timing of billing of our professional services revenue  contractual payment terms  client payment patterns including approval or processing delays and cash management and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
as a result of these different factors  our dso decreased from fiscal to fiscal  after increasing from fiscal to fiscal

contractual obligations and commitments on january   we entered into a credit facility with a bank that provided for a term loan  in a principal amount of million and a receivables borrowing base revolving credit line in an aggregate principal amount of up to million 
all amounts borrowed under the term loan and the credit line were repaid in full on or prior to january   in accordance with the terms of the credit facility 
in addition  we amended this credit facility in november to add an equipment facility up to a principal amount of million 
we obtained advances on november  and february  with respect to the equipment facility  and those advances mature on november  and february   respectively 
we are not entitled under the terms of the facility to obtain any additional advances 
as of may   the outstanding amount of our obligations under the equipment facility was million  and we were in compliance with our liquidity and ebitda covenants under the equipment facility 
the interest rate applicable to loans under the equipment facility is the bank s prime rate plus 
as of may   there were no material changes in capital leases  operating lease obligations  purchase obligations or any other long term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as compared to such obligations and liabilities as of may  on july   we entered into a new credit facility with a bank 
the new facility provides for a new revolving line of credit with a maturity date of july  an aggregate principal amount of up to million may be outstanding at any time under the revolving line 
with respect to borrowings in excess of million  the revolving line is a receivables borrowing base credit facility 
the revolving line also includes a sublimit of up to million for letters of credit  cash management and foreign exchange services 
the interest rate applicable to the revolving line is  at our option  equal to either i the sum of the prime rate as defined in the facility plus  or ii the sum of the libor rate as defined in the facility plus

such 
table of contents restrictions and limitations are subject to usual and customary exceptions contained in credit agreements of this nature 
in addition  the facilities require that we satisfy a a minimum quarterly ebitda covenant and b a minimum monthly adjusted quick ratio covenant which also includes a requirement that we maintain certain levels of cash and cash equivalents in accounts with the bank or in accounts at other financial institutions with which the bank has an account control agreement 
if the new facility had been in place on may   we would have been in compliance with these covenants as of such date 
the facilities also contain usual and customary events of default subject to certain threshold amounts and grace periods 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  we may be required to repay the obligations under the credit facility prior to their stated maturity date and the bank may be able to foreclose on any collateral provided by us 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources  combined with cash flows generated from revenues will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital  capital expense and business expansion requirements  for at least the next months 
however  we may be required  or could choose  to raise additional funds at any time 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our future revenues  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing and general and administrative activities  the success of our existing and new product and service offerings and competing technological and market developments 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our borrowings and investments 
as described above  we previously entered into a credit facility with a bank that provided for a term loan in a principal amount of million and a receivables borrowing base revolving credit line in an aggregate principal amount of up to million  but all amounts borrowed under the term loan and the credit line were repaid in full on or prior to january   in accordance with the terms of the credit facility 
in addition  we amended this credit facility in november to add an equipment facility up to a principal amount of million 
we obtained advances on november  and february  with respect to the equipment facility and those advances mature on november  and february   respectively 
we are not entitled under the terms of the facility to obtain any additional advances 
as of may   the outstanding amount of our obligations under the equipment facility was million 
the interest rate applicable to loans under the equipment facility is the bank s prime rate plus 
on july   we entered into a new credit facility with a bank 
the new facility provides for a new revolving line of credit with a maturity date of july  an aggregate principal amount of up to million may be outstanding at any time under the revolving line 
the interest rate applicable to the revolving line is  at our option  equal to either i the sum of the prime rate as defined in the facility plus  or ii the sum of the libor rate as defined in the facility plus 
the new credit facility also incorporates under its terms the outstanding million owed under the prior equipment facility  but the repayment terms of the prior equipment facility otherwise remain unchanged 
at may   we had available cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
of this amount  approximately million was invested in money market accounts bearing variable interest rates of between and 
the remainder of our cash and cash equivalents is held in non interest bearing accounts at several banks 
variable interest rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
foreign currency risk we provide our products and services to customers in the united states  europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
sales are primarily made in us dollars  and to a lesser extent  british pounds and euros  however  as we continue to expand our operations  more of our contracts may be denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars  japanese yen or other foreign currencies 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we do not use derivative instruments to manage risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises in part from parent company s inter company accounts which are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are translated into us dollars  they have an impact on our operating results depending upon the movement in foreign currency rates 
during the fiscal year ended may   our total realized and unrealized losses due to movements in foreign currencies  primarily british pound  european union euro  japanese yen and australian dollar  were  as exchange rates vary  these foreign exchange results may vary and adversely or favorably impact operating results 
an unfavorable change of in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements
