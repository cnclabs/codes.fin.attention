purchase price allocation in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  the purchase price of acquired properties is allocated to tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities based on their respective fair values 
the allocation to tangible assets building and land is based upon determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
additionally  the purchase price of the applicable property is allocated to the above or below market value of in place leases and the value of in place leases and related tenant relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of the acquired in place leases is determined based upon the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term  and ii the company s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above market leases are included in identified intangible assets and below market lease values are included in liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are amortized to rental revenue over the weighted average remaining term of the acquired leases with each property 
the total amount of identified intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in place lease costs and the value of tenant relationships based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the company s overall relationship with that respective tenant 
characteristics considered in allocating these values include the nature and extent of the credit quality and expectations of lease renewals  among other factors 
these allocations are subject to change within one year of the date of purchase based on information related to one or more events identified at the date of purchase that confirm the value of an asset or liability of an acquired property 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets are periodically evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in the event that periodic assessments reflect that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest that are expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset  the company would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the fair value of the property 
the company estimates the fair value using available market information or other industry valuation techniques such as present value calculations 
this valuation review resulted in the recognition of an impairment charge of approximately million against the carrying value of the properties and real estate investments during the year ended december  no impairment losses were recognized for the years ended december  and the company recognizes goodwill and other non amortizing intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

under sfas no 
 goodwill is recorded at its carrying value and is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
the company recognizes goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
and tests the carrying value for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential 
table of contents impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
to estimate the fair value of its reporting units  the company used a discounted cash flow model and market comparable data 
significant judgment is required by management in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model 
these assumptions include cash flow projections utilizing revenue growth rates  profit margin percentages  discount rates  market economic conditions  etc 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered to not be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated a potential impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one  over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identified intangibles 
during the fourth quarter of  the company identified the uncertainty surrounding the global economy and the volatility of the company s market capitalization as goodwill impairment indicators 
the company s goodwill impairment analysis resulted in the recognition of an impairment charge of approximately million during the year ended december  the company also analyzed it s trade name for impairment pursuant to sfas no 
and determined that the trade name was not impaired as of december  accordingly  no impairment charge was recorded related to the trade name during the year ended december  in addition to testing goodwill and it s trade name for impairment  the company tested the intangible contract rights for impairment during the fourth quarter of the intangible contract rights represent the legal right to future disposition fees of a portfolio of real estate properties under contract 
as a result of the current economic environment  a portion of these disposition fees may not be recoverable 
based on the company s analysis for the current and projected property values  condition of the properties and status of mortgage loans payable  the company determined that there are certain properties for which receipt of disposition fees was improbable 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to the impaired intangible contract rights as of december  insurance and claim reserves the company has maintained partially self insured and deductible programs for  general liability  workers compensation and certain employee health care costs 
in addition  the company assumed liabilities at the date of the merger representing reserves related to a self insured errors and omissions program of the acquired company 
reserves for all such programs are included in accrued claims and settlements and compensation and employee benefits payable  as appropriate 
reserves are based on the aggregate of the liability for reported claims and an actuarially based estimate of incurred but not reported claims 
as of the date of the merger  the company entered into a premium based insurance policy for all error and omission coverage on claims arising after the date of the merger 
claims arising prior to the date of the merger continue to be applied against the previously mentioned liability reserves assumed relative to the acquired company 
the company is also subject to various proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to commission disputes and environmental  labor and other matters  and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters 
a determination of the amount of reserves  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
new developments in each matter  or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters  may warrant an increase or decrease in the amount of these reserves

the company recognizes goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
and tests the carrying value for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
to estimate the fair value of its reporting units  the company used a discounted cash flow model and market comparable data 
significant judgment is required by management in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model 
these assumptions include cash flow projections utilizing revenue growth rates  profit margin percentages  discount rates  market economic conditions  etc 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered to not be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment

the credit facility restricts our ability to operate outside of the approved budget without the permission of the requisite majority of lenders  and the failure to operate within the approved budget by more than the greater of  or on a cumulative basis for more than three consecutive weeks would  absent the requisite approval  result in an event of default of the credit facility and make the entire balance due and payable
