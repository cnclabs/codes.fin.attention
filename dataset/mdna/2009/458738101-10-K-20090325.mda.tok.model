item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
general overview and trends we are a genetics focused personalized health company that develops preventive consumer products and genetic tests for sale to the emerging personalized health market 
our vision is to build a leading personalized health and wellness company using the science of applied genetics to empower people to understand the genetic components of their health  to provide physicians guidance on patient care and to provide drug developers the tools necessary to create new  innovative therapeutic products 
we currently have two primary business segments that include personalized health segment this segment conducts  researches  develops  market and sells genetic test panels primarily in inflammatory and metabolic areas to provide better insight into health  wellness and disease 
consumer products segment comprising the alan james group ajg business  is focused on developing  selling and marketing nutritional supplements and products into retail consumer channels 
these two segments contribute toward our overall mission of developing tests and products that can help individuals improve and maintain their health through preventive measures 
we plan to pursue this by developing genetic risk assessment tests for use in multiple indications  countries and various demographics in our personalized health segment  processing genetic risk assessment tests in our clinical laboratory improvement act of clia certified lab or in those of sublicensees in our personalized health segment  and developing and acquiring nutritional products to be distributed in multiple consumer channels in our consumer products segment 
in  sales of our personalized health products began under marketing and other business arrangements with alticor 
for  alticor represents a significant customer representing virtually all of our personalized health segment revenues and over of consolidated revenues 
our consumer products segment sells branded nutritional products  including ginsana  ginkoba  and venastat through the nation s largest food  drug and mass retailers 
the addition of ajg added substantial revenues to our business and in the year ended december   ajg represented over of our consolidated revenues 
customer concentration in our consumer products segment is high and our largest customer accounted for approximately of revenues in that segment 
in  the addition of ajg also added to the selling general and administrative costs necessary to run a consumer products business and it added substantial amortization of intangible assets acquired in the purchase 
in the year ended december   amortization of intangible assets was approximately million compared to less than  in the year prior to the acquisition 
for the year ended december   amortization of intangible assets was approximately million 
we expect such amortization expense will continue in and beyond 
we have traditionally spent approximately million annually on research and development 
we currently anticipate that range of spending to continue into our current development programs focus on obesity  heart disease  osteoporosis  osteoarthritis  skin aging  sports nutrition and weight management genetic risk assessment tests  as well as new proprietary supplements for distribution 
table of contents through our consumer products segment 
we expect that these programs will also lead to the personalized selection of nutritional and therapeutic products and provide consumers and healthcare professionals with better preventive product alternatives 
we are in the process of developing our own brand of genetic test products for launch with partners and by ourselves 
as a result  corporate selling  general  marketing and administrative expenses associated with the launch for this new brand of genetic test products is likely to increase in we currently have borrowings available under our credit line of million  which permits borrowing any time prior to march  we expect to be able to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months with revenue from product sales and borrowings from our credit facility 
current economic conditions may negatively affect our sales which may impact the funding of projects in development 
we will monitor our spending accordingly 
in march  we entered into a research agreement with alticor to develop genetic tests and software to assess personalized risk and develop and use screening technologies to validate the effectiveness of the nutrigenomic consumables alticor is developing 
in march and in march  we entered into new agreements with alticor to continue the research 
in june  we entered into another research agreement with alticor to conduct research into the development of a test to identify individuals with specific genetic variations that affect how people gain and maintain weight 
this project was completed during in june  we entered into another agreement with alticor to perform association studies on composite genotypes to skin inflammatory response 
as of december   the research agreements described above have been completed 
see financial statement footnote for a discussion of our strategic alliance with alticor 
on february   we entered into a new research agreement with access business group international llc abg  a subsidiary of alticor inc the research agreement encompasses four primary areas osteoporosis  cardiovascular disease  nutrigenomics  and dermagenomics 
we will be conducting various clinical studies  which shall be fully funded by alticor 
some of these studies aim to correlate snp gene variations to the risk of osteoporosis or cardiovascular disease in asian populations 
other studies conducted in north american populations will seek to identify genetic factors that influence athletic performance nutrigenomics and skin health  such as wrinkles  elasticity  aging dermagenomics  for the purpose of developing products to enhance healthy aging 
under the terms of the agreement  abg paid us million during for the research 
in addition  we recognized approximately  of deferred receipts which were unused from prior research agreements with alticor 
in our personalized health segment  the competition is defined  but the markets and customer base are not well established 
adoption of such technologies by consumers requires substantial market development and customer education 
we have placed a significant focus of this effort in our relationship with our primary customer  alticor  a significant direct marketing company 
alticor has begun to develop the direct to consumer market  however  the overall market is unproven and our challenge in and beyond will be to work to develop this market 
we cannot predict any fluctuations we may experience in our test revenues or whether revenues derived from alticor related to the heart health and general nutrition genetic tests will be sustained in future periods 
in order to help facilitate the sales of tests by our number one customer  we have engaged a senior executive  who is based in michigan on site at alticor 
in our consumer product segment  the nutritional products and supplement industry is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in demand for products and new product introductions 
the success of new product offerings depends upon a number of factors  including accurately anticipating customer needs  innovating and developing new products  successfully commercializing new products in a timely manner  pricing our products competitively  manufacturing and delivering our products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner  and differentiating our product offerings from those of our competitors 

table of contents in  the aggregate sales of our brand name nutritional products  including ginkoba  ginsana  and venastat demonstrated a slight increase from the prior year which we believe is due to an increase in advertising spend 
we face competition with private label offerings as well as other branded product introductions 
further  our opportunities for new distribution on the existing product lines are limited 
we believe our growth is also partly due to consumers focusing their buying patterns on retailers that are more affordable  which is where our products are sold 
increased growth  we believe will be more dependent on our ability to adapt to changing consumer trends with the introduction of new products  making customers more aware of our products or improvements to existing products 
the financial downturn of the economy most likely has slowed our growth in our consumer product segment 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and borrowings available under our credit facilities of million which permits borrowing at any time prior to march  on march   our credit line was extended to permit borrowing at any time prior to march  cash used in operations was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  cash used in operations is primarily impacted by operating results and changes in working capital  particularly the timing of the collection of receivables  inventory levels and the timing of payments to suppliers 
a significant use of cash in the year ended december  was a payment of million  relating to the settlement of purchase obligations with the alan james group  
million of which had been accrued prior to we also recognized as revenue 
million of previously deferred cash receipts 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to 
million for the year ended december  the most significant use of cash in investing activities was the settlement of claims related to the acquisition of the assets and business of the alan james group as described above 
as a result of the settlement  we paid additional consideration of 
million 
capital additions were 
million for the year ended december  compared to thousand for the year ended december  the increase in capital additions consists of furniture  computers and office equipment associated with increased employee headcount in in addition  we completed substantial improvements to our computer servers 
increases in other assets consist primarily of capitalized patent costs which were 
million for the year ended december  as compared to 
million for the year ended december  we continue to incur increased expenses in building our patent portfolio 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to 
million for the year ended december  on june  we received proceeds from the issuance of a note payable in the amount of million under an existing credit facility where no such proceeds were received during the year ended december  in addition  during the year ended december   we received  from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases through the employee stock purchase plan 
during the year ended december  we received 
million from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases through the employee stock purchase plan and  from our rights offering completed in january  in december  we were notified of our failure to comply with the nyse alternext us llc the exchange continued listing standards under section of the company guide 
specifically  the exchange noted our failure to comply with section a iii of the company guide because our stockholders equity was less than  and we had losses from continuing operations and net losses in our five most recent fiscal years 
the notice was based on a review by the exchange of publically available information  including the company s quarterly report on from q for the 
table of contents quarter ended september  as of december  the company s stockholders equity was million 
on january  we submitted a plan to the exchange to meet the continued listing requirements 
the exchange has days in which to decide whether the plan is acceptable 
the plan consists of several elements  but is primarily focused on increasing the sales of our products and services and raising additional equity capital 
if our plan is not accepted  we do not make progress toward compliance consistent with the plan  or we are not in compliance at the end of the plan period  then our common stock may be subject to delisting proceedings by the exchange 
in january  we purchased equipment which will allow for a higher volume genetic analysis in our commercial laboratory resulting in a significantly lower per test cost 
we expect the equipment will to be validated and installed in the second quarter of the total cost of the equipment is approximately 
million  with an additional 
million for software development 
we currently do not have any commitments for any additional material capital purchases 
operating cash is currently generated by sales of consumer products  genetic tests  royalties  and reimbursements for funded research 
the amount of cash we generate is not sufficient to fund our operations 
in addition to funds generated by our income  we have available a million credit line with alticor  our major investor 
cash received by us from customers and paid to vendors is relatively stable from period to period due to the nature of our consumer products business 
clinical studies and other research and development activities may require cash outflows that depend on the timing of activities 
we believe that our cash on hand and line of credit availability from alticor will fund our operations and meet our overall strategic plan for at least the next twelve months 
we may need to raise additional capital  if market conditions permit  to continue investment in new product development  improving our distribution channels  maintain our listing on the nyse alternext us  and other aspects of our overall strategic plan 
we have no debt covenants as part of our borrowing facility with alticor 
we currently have a balance owed on our line of credit of million  which is reflected as debt on our balance sheet 
we anticipate using additional funds available on our credit facility in the foreseeable future 
the current status of the financial markets may affect our ability to raise additional capital 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is included in the table below payments due by period s contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total 
table of contents results of operations s twelve months ended december  personalized health genetics testing contract research and development royalty and other segment total consumer products total revenue cost of revenue gross margin gross margin percent twelve months ended december  and december  total revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of 
million  or  is primarily attributable to an increase in consumer product revenue  an increase in royalty revenue and an increase in contract research revenue  offset by a decrease in genetic test revenue 
we continue to experience modest growth in our consumer product business  with net revenues of million in  compared to million in during royalty revenue increased approximately 
million  primarily attributable to a payment received from a foreign distributor for previous royalties due 
genetic test sales decreased approximately 
million  primarily due to a decline in higher customer demand which occurred during the product s initial launch in on september   we entered into an amended license agreement with access business group granting us a non exclusive right to sell product on our own 
we are in the process of re launching our products through the alticor channel  as well as through our own sales channels 
increase in revenue from our consumer products of approximately 
million includes income of 
million from a lower rate of incentive redemption experience reflected in accrued trade promotions 
our experience participating in these promotional activities over time resulted in a lower rate of incentive redemption experience than had been accrued 
in the future we anticipate the lower rate to continue and our accrual will be based on this experience 
genetic testing revenue is a result of tests sold and processed which is driven by consumer demand 
contract research revenue is recognized when alticor sponsored research expenses are incurred 
we have two significant customers 
in our personalized health segment  our significant customer  alticor  which is our principal shareholder  represented approximately of revenues 
in our consumer products segment  our other significant customer represented approximately of revenues 
together  these two significant customers accounted for approximately of our total revenues during cost of revenue for the year ended december  was million or of revenue compared to million or for the year ended december  in our personalized health segment  cost of revenue for the year ended december  was 
million or of its revenue compared to million or for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue in our personalized health segment is primarily attributable to a decrease in costs of providing genetic testing services partially offset by an increase in the cost of providing contract research services 

table of contents the increase in the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in our personalized health segment is primarily attributable to the fixed costs associated with our genetic testing laboratory which remain fixed with changes in revenue 
in our consumer products segment  cost of revenue for the year ended december  was million or compared to million  or  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to increased consumer product sales 
gross margin for the year ended december   was million  or  compared to million  or  for the year ended december  in our personalized health segment gross margin for the year ended december   was million  or  compared to million  or  for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin of 
million is primarily attributable to decreased genetic test sales 
the decrease in the gross margin percentage as a percentage of revenue in our personalized health segment is attributable to the fixed costs associated with our genetic testing laboratory which remain constant with changes in revenue 
in our consumer products segment gross margin was million  or  for the year ended december   compared to million  or  for the year ended december  the increase of 
million is primarily attributable to increased sales of our consumer products 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of 
million or is primarily attributable to an increase in expenses relating to our sponsored research agreement with yonsei university  combined with increased costs related to our patent portfolio  partially offset by a reduction in research consulting expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of 
million  or  is primarily attributable to increased promotional and advertising expenses in both our personalized health segment and consumer products segment  plus additional compensation expenses due to our increased headcount 
these expense increases were partially offset by a reduction in settlement expenses relating to the acquisition of the alan james group  of which 
million was accrued in and no such expenses were accrued in amortization of intangible assets was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of 
million  or  is primarily attributable to amortization expense associated with a reduction in the basis of intangible assets we acquired from the alan james group resulting from our march settlement agreement with the former owners of that business 
total other income was  for the year ended december  as compared to other expenses of  for the year ended december  the decrease of  is primarily attributable to amortization of note discount that we recognized in the year ended december  where no such discount was recognized in the year ended december  net interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to net interest income of  for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income of  is primarily attributable to a lower cash balance earning interest in in august  alticor purchased from the company million of common stock 
the sale of common stock to alticor  offset by the subsequent purchase of the alan james group  provided the company with a larger average cash balance in than in operating cash utilization  partially offset by million in loan proceeds in from an advance under our line of credit with alticor  resulted in lower cash balances in financial market conditions have significantly reduced the interest rate we earn on our funds

table of contents comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase of million was due largely to inclusion of our consumer products segment for the full year whereas in that segment was only included since its acquisition on august  our personalized health segment resulted in an increase of 
million in over we have two significant customers 
in our personalized health segment  our significant customer  alticor  which is the company s majority shareholder  represented approximately of the revenues of that segment and in our consumer product segment  our significant customer represented approximately of the revenues of that segment 
together  these two customers accounted for approximately of revenues 
gross profit was approximately million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  gross profit from our personalized health segment was approximately million  or of its revenue compared to approximately million and in the year ended december  gross profit from our consumer product segment was approximately million  or of its revenue compared to approximately

million or 
funded research and development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately 
million or 
between march and march  we entered into various research agreements with alticor as described above in general overview and trends 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million for year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or 
approximately million of this increase results from the inclusion of our consumer product segment for the full year and only since its acquisition in august in the prior year 
amortization of intangible assets was approximately million for year ended december  compared to approximately 
million during the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to amortization expense associated with acquisition related intangible assets for the full year in and only since acquisition in august  in the year ended december  other net expense decreased by approximately 
million from to approximately 
million in principally as a result of increased interest income 
revenue  gross profit  operating and other expenses contributed to a net loss of approximately million  or per share  for the year ended december  compared to a loss of approximately million  or per share for critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates upon 
table of contents which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are the following strategic alliance with alticor we account for our strategic alliance with alticor in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for convertible instruments granted or issued to a nonemployee for goods or services or a combination of goods or services and cash eitf no 

under eitf no 
 the proceeds received from alticor in connection with the march  transaction must first be allocated to the fair value of the convertible instruments issued 
as of march   the fair value of the convertible instruments issued was million  therefore proceeds received from alticor in connection with the march  transaction  up to million  have been recorded as equity 
revenue recognition revenue from genetic testing services is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  service has been rendered  the sales price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
service is deemed to be rendered when the results have been reported to the individual who ordered the test 
revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  the sales price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have no consignment sales 
product revenue is reduced for allowances and adjustments  including returns  discontinued items  discounts  trade promotions and slotting fees 
revenue from contract research and development is recognized over the term of the contract as we perform our obligations under the contract 
allowance for sales returns our recognition of revenue from sales to retailers is impacted by giving them rights to return damaged and outdated products as well as the fact that as a practical business matter  our sales force  along with our customers  is constantly working to ensure profitability of our products within retailers by rotating slow moving items out of stores and replacing those products with what we and the retailer expect will be more profitable  faster selling items 
for product sales  we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate future returns  therefore we recognize revenue at the time of sale 
for product sales which we cannot estimate future returns  particularly new products  we defer revenue recognition until the return privilege has substantially expired or the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
an adverse change in any of these factors may result in the need for additional sales returns 
we analyze sales returns in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
we are able to make reasonable and reliable estimates based on history 
we also monitor the buying patterns of the end users of our products based on sales data received 
we review our estimated product returns based on expected data communicated by our customers 
we also monitor the levels of inventory at our largest customers to avoid excessive customer stocking of merchandise 
we believe we have sufficient interaction and knowledge of our customers and of the industry trends and conditions to adjust the accrual for returns when necessary 
we believe that this analysis creates appropriate estimates of expected future returns 
there is no guarantee that future returns will not increase to  or exceed  the levels experienced in the past 
furthermore  the possibility exists that should we lose a major account  we may agree to accept a substantial amount of returns 

table of contents trade promotions we use objective procedures for estimating our allowance for trade promotions 
the allowance for trade promotions offered to customers is based on contracted terms or other arrangements agreed in advance  as well as historical experience 
the company may adjust its estimate based on these factors to more accurately reflect trade promotion costs 
the company adjusted the estimate in the fourth quarter of by approximately  with an offsetting increase to revenue 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we monitor our inventory and analyze it on a regular basis 
cycle counts are taken periodically to verify inventory levels 
in addition  we analyze the movement of items within our inventory in an effort to determine the likelihood that inventory will be sold or used before expiration dates are reached 
we provide an allowance against that portion of inventory that we believe is unlikely to be sold or used before expiration dates are reached 
an adverse change in any of these factors may result in the need for additional inventory allowance 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective basis 
sfas no 
r addresses all forms of share based payment sbp awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas no 
r requires us to expense sbp awards with compensation cost for sbp transactions measured at fair value 
sfas no 
r applies to new equity awards and to equity awards modified  repurchased or canceled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the effective date shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the effective date 
the compensation cost for that portion of awards shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated from the pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
additionally  common stock purchased pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan will be expensed based upon the fair market value in excess of purchase price 
intangible assets purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets purchased and liabilities assumed 
we have accounted for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
values were assigned to intangible assets based on third party independent valuations  as well as management s forecasts and projections that include assumptions related to future revenue and cash flows generated from the acquired assets 
income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates  including those outside the united states  which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of the enacted tax law  the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
we record a 
table of contents valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize these assets 
the valuation allowance is based on management s estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or management adjusts these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust its valuation allowance  which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
in january  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
at december   we reviewed all material tax positions for all years open to statute and for all tax jurisdictions open to statute to determine whether it was more likely than not that the positions taken would be sustained based upon the technical merits of those positions 
the implementation of fin had no impact on our financial statements 
contingencies estimated losses from contingencies are accrued by management based upon the likelihood of a loss and the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
estimating potential losses  or even a range of losses  is difficult and involves a great deal of judgment 
management relies primarily on assessments made by its external legal counsel to make our determination as to whether a loss contingency arising from litigation should be recorded or disclosed 
should the resolution of a contingency result in a loss that we did not accrue because management did not believe a loss was probable or capable of being reasonably estimated  then this loss would result in a charge to income in the period the contingency was resolved 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 
was issued to provide consistency and comparability in determining fair value measurements and to provide for expanded disclosures about fair measurements 
the definition of fair value maintains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value but focuses on the exit price of the asset or liability 
the exit price is the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability adjusted for certain inherent risks and restrictions 
expanded disclosures are also required about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the effective date is for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the company has not elected to account for any of its assets or liabilities using the fair value option under sfas no 
and accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in july  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf clarifies the accounting for non refundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for research and development activities 
eitf states that such payments should be capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or the services rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted eitf on january  the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on our financial position or the results of our operations 
in december  the fasb completed the second phase of its business combination project and issued the following two accounting standards i 
statement no 
r  business combinations  and ii 
statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
these statements dramatically change the way companies account for business combinations and noncontrolling interests 
compared with their predecessors  statements r and will require more assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date  liabilities related to contingent consideration to be remeasured at fair value in each subsequent reporting period  an acquirer in preacquisition periods to expense all acquisition related costs  and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries initially to be measured at fair value and classified as a separate component of equity 
statements r and should both be applied prospectively for fiscal years beginning on or after december  however  statement requires entities to apply the presentation and disclosure requirements retrospectively to comparative financial statements if presented 
both standards prohibit early adoption 
we are currently assessing the impact these new standards will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb ratified a consensus opinion reached by the eitf on eitf issue  accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf 
the guidance in eitf defines collaborative arrangements and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements for transactions within a collaborative arrangement both with third parties and between participants in the arrangement 
the consensus in eitf is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  the consensus requires retrospective application to all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date  unless retrospective application is impracticable 
the impracticability evaluation and exception should be performed on an arrangement by arrangement basis 
we are evaluating the impact eitf will have on our financial statements 
we currently do not believe that the adoption of eitf will have a significant effect on our financial statements 
in december  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab  share based payment sab which amends sab  share based payment  to permit public companies  under certain circumstances  to use the simplified method in sab for employee option grants after december  use of the simplified method after december is permitted only for 
table of contents companies whose historical data about their employees exercise behavior does not provide a reasonable basis for estimating the expected term of the options 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp 
fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the objective of this fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of fsp may have on our consolidated financial statements 
we currently use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for employee option grants  as adequate historical experience is not available to provide a reasonable estimate 
sab is effective for employee options granted after december  we adopted sab on january  and will continue to apply the simplified method until enough historical experience is readily available to provide a reasonable estimate of the expected term for employee option grants 
in november  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for defensive intangible assets  or eitf eitf seeks to clarify how to account for defensive intangible assets  or those intangible assets acquired in a business combination that an entity does not intend to actively use but does intend to prevent others from using  subsequent to initial measurement 
eitf is effective for all intangible assets acquired during the first fiscal year beginning on or after december  early adoption is not permitted 
the impact of the adoption of eitf will be dependent upon the type and structure of any transactions that the company may make in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as of december  the only financial instruments we carried were cash and cash equivalents denominated in us dollars 
we believe the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is immaterial 
while we recognize that the interest rates these instruments bear are currently at historically low levels  we believe it is most prudent to maintain these relatively low risk positions during this time of unprecedented volatility and uncertainty across the global financial markets 
some of our sales and some of our costs occur outside the united states and are transacted in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
at this time we do not believe this risk is material and we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk 
however  if foreign sales increase and the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation increases  we may in the future consider utilizing derivative instruments to mitigate these risks
