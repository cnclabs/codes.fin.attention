revenues we generate a substantial portion of our revenues on a per transaction basis  most of which is derived from contracts that extend up to months from execution 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenues from transactions processed compared to for year ended december  similar to previous years  most of the remainder of our revenues in were generated by professional services 
costs and expenses our costs and expenses consist of cost of services  research and development  selling  general and administrative and depreciation and amortization 
cost of services includes all direct materials  direct labor  cost of facilities and those indirect costs related to revenues such as indirect labor  materials and supplies 
our primary cost of services is related to our information technology and systems department  including network costs  data center maintenance  database management and 
table of contents data processing costs  as well as personnel costs associated with service implementation  customer deployment and customer care 
also included in cost of services are costs associated with our exception handling centers and the maintenance of those centers 
currently  we utilize a combination of employees and third party providers to process transactions through these centers 
research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred 
research and development expense consists primarily of costs related to personnel  including salaries and other personnel related expenses  consulting fees and the cost of facilities  computer and support services used in service technology development 
we also expense costs relating to developing modifications and minor enhancements of our existing technology and services 
selling expense consists of personnel costs including salaries  sales commissions  sales operations and other personnel related expense  travel and related expense  trade shows  costs of communications equipment and support services  facilities costs  consulting fees and costs of marketing programs  such as internet and print

current trends affecting our results of operations our on demand business model enables delivery of our proprietary solutions over the web as a service and has been driven by market trends such as various forms of order provisioning  local number portability  the implementation of new technologies  subscriber growth  competitive churn  network changes and consolidations in the industry 
in particular  the emergence of order provisioning of e commerce transactions for wireless  voip  lnp  and other communication services surrounding the convergence of bundled services has increased the need for our services and we believe will continue to be a source of growth for us 
in the second quarter of  we were informed by at t that they would be changing their process of activating the iphone product from a process that utilized our convergencenow platform to an activation process that occurs at retail stores 
this change in process requires customers to activate the iphone at at t or apple stores to discourage the practice of unlocking the device for use on other networks 
this activation process is a service that is currently not supported by synchronoss for at t 
as a result of this development  our revenues for the year ended december  were lower  compared to the year ended december  nevertheless  we exited with an iphone revenue contribution rate in excess of million annually 
to support the growth driven by the industry trends mentioned above  we continue to look for opportunities to improve our operating efficiencies  such as the utilization of offshore technical and non technical resources for our exception handling center management 
we believe that these opportunities will continue to provide future benefits and position us to support revenue growth 
in addition  we anticipate further automation of the transactions generated by our more mature customers and additional transaction types 
these development efforts are expected to reduce exception handling costs 
loss of revenue related to the activation of iphones on at t s network  which has a higher gross margin due to the high rate of automation  caused revenues and gross margins to decline in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a fiscal period 
the securities and exchange commission sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires significant judgment and 
table of contents estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report on form k 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  correct and reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
see risk factors for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue we provide services principally on a transactional basis or  at times  on a fixed fee basis and recognize the revenues as the services are performed or delivered as discussed below transactional service arrangements transaction revenues consist of revenues derived from the processing of transactions through our service platforms and represented approximately   and of our revenues for the years ended december   and transaction service arrangements include services such as equipment orders  new account set up  number port requests  credit checks and inventory management 
transaction revenues are principally based on a set price per transaction and are recognized based on the number of transactions processed during each reporting period 
revenues are recorded based on the total number of transactions processed at the applicable price established in the relevant contract 
the total amount of revenues recognized is based primarily on the volume of transactions 
as automation rates increase  transaction costs for our customer decreases 
many of our contracts guarantee minimum volume transactions from the customer 
in these instances  if the customer s total transaction volume for the period is less than the contractual amount  we record revenues at the minimum guaranteed amount 
at times  transaction revenues may also include billings to customers based on the number of individuals dedicated to processing transactions 
set up fees for transactional service arrangements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract since these amounts would not have been paid by the customer without the related transactional service arrangement 
revenues are presented net of discounts  which are volume level driven  or credits  which are performance driven  and are determined in the period in which the volume thresholds are met or the services are provided 
professional service arrangements professional service revenues represented approximately   and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
professional services  when sold with transactional service arrangements  are accounted for separately when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the professional services 
when accounted for separately  professional service revenues are recognized on a monthly basis  as services are performed and all other elements of revenue recognition have been satisfied 
in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from transaction service revenues  we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the professional services from other vendors  whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists of the undelivered elements  the nature of the professional services  the timing of when the professional contract was signed in comparison to the transaction service start date and the contractual independence of the transactional service from the professional services 
if a professional service arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting  we would recognize the professional service revenues ratably over the remaining term of the transaction contract 
there were no such arrangements for the years ended december   and subscription service arrangements subscription service arrangements represented approximately of our revenues for the years ended december  and and for the year ended december   and relate principally to our activationnow platform service which the customer accesses through a graphical user 
table of contents interface 
we record revenues on a straight line basis over the life of the contract for our subscription service contracts 
deferred revenue deferred revenues represent billings to customers for services in advance of the performance of services  with revenues recognized as the services are rendered  and also includes the fair value of deferred revenues recorded as a result of the wisor acquisition 
service level standards pursuant to certain contracts  we are subject to service level standards and to corresponding penalties for failure to meet those standards 
all performance related penalties are reflected as a corresponding reduction of our revenues 
these penalties  if applicable  are recorded in the month incurred and were not significant for the years ended december   and allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated bad debts resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the amount of the allowance account is based on historical experience and our analysis of the accounts receivable balance outstanding 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit losses that we have in the past or that our reserves will be adequate 
if the financial condition of one of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in its inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional expense in the period that this determination was made 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
under this method  deferred income tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin to create a single model to address accounting for uncertain tax positions 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes  by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted fin as of january   as required and determined that the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
as of december   and we had total unrecognized tax benefits of and which includes and for interest related to uncertain positions  respectively 
components of the reserve are classified as either current or long term in the consolidated balance sheet based on when we expect each of the items to be settled 
accordingly  we recorded a long term liability of on our balance sheet at december  that would reduce the effective tax rate if recognized 
we recorded interest and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain income tax positions as a component of interest expense 
we did not accrue for interest or penalties as of december  or any period prior to tax returns for all years and thereafter are subject to future examination by tax authorities 
in  the net increase in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits was and the net increase for interest expense was we expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during fiscal year  however  we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
while we believe we have identified all reasonably identified exposures and that the reserve we have established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances  it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved 
it is also possible that 
table of contents changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of our tax reserve 
stock based compensation as of december   we maintain two stock based compensation plans 
prior to january   we were applying the disclosure only provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted subsequent to january  and is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
under sfas r  an equity instrument is not considered to be issued until the instrument vests 
as a result  compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period with an offsetting credit to additional paid in capital 
compensation expense also includes the amortization on a straight line basis over the remaining vesting period of the intrinsic values of the stock options granted prior to calculated in accordance with accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
we classify benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow with a corresponding operating cash outflow 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
expected volatility was calculated based on a blended weighted average of historical information of similar public entities for which historical information was available 
we will continue to use this approach using other similar public entity volatility information until our historical volatility is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
the average expected life was determined using the sec shortcut approach as described in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 which is the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common or preferred equity and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior  as well as a historical analysis of actual option forfeitures 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model are as follows year ended year ended december  december  expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate expected life of options in years expected dividend yield the weighted average fair value as of the date of grant of the options granted was  and per share for the year ended december   and  respectively 
the total stock based compensation cost related to non vested equity awards not yet recognized as an expense as of december  was approximately million

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity has been cash provided by operations and cash provided from our initial public offering ipo which was completed on june  the net proceeds from our ipo and the exercise of the over allotment option by our ipo underwriters were approximately million  which enabled us to strengthen our balance sheet 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance was million at december   a decrease of million as compared to the end of this decrease was due primarily to the repurchase of million of our common stock and the acquisition of wisor for net cash of approximately million partially offset by million of cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  we anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be to fund the expansion of our business through both organic growth as well as possible acquisition activities and to expand our customer base internationally 
uses of cash will also include facility expansion  capital expenditures and working capital 
on may   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
the duration of the repurchase program was up to twelve months 
under the program  we were entitled to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market  through block trades or otherwise at prices deemed appropriate by us 
the timing and amount of repurchase transactions under the program were dependant on market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations 
under the program  we repurchased a total of million shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the purchases were funded from available working capital 
in may  we entered into an agreement to lease space for our pennsylvania offices and data center in a newly constructed facility 
the lease has a term of years and months with an option to extend the term of the lease for two consecutive five year periods 
in august  we amended the lease whereby we agreed to reimburse the landlord for certain leasehold improvements we had requested 
these improvements were under construction at december  since the tenant improvements  under the lease amendment  are considered structural in nature and we are responsible for the cost of these improvements  for accounting purposes under emerging issues task force issue no 
the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction eitf  we are considered to be the owner of the construction project 
in accordance with eitf  we recorded assets on our balance sheet for all of the costs paid by our lessor to construct the pennsylvania facility through december   along with corresponding financing liabilities for amounts equal to these lessor paid construction costs through december  this asset and corresponding liability do not affect the total cash payments we are obligated to make under the lease agreements 
discussion of cash flows year ended december   compared to the year ended december  cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is primarily due to a decrease to accounts receivable of million due to lower revenues in and partially offset by a decrease to accrued expenses  a decrease to accounts payable and a decrease to net income of million from cash flows from investing 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  compared to net cash used of million in the increase of million was primarily due to the million net cash outflow for the acquisition of wisor and a net change in investments of marketable securities of million partially offset by decreased purchases of fixed assets of million 
expenditures related to fixed assets in were higher than due to increased spending to support customer initiatives that required a higher volume of transactions 
cash flows from financing 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in in may  we initiated a stock repurchase program and repurchased million shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the remaining difference was due to decreased net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million through the exercise of stock options  decreased tax benefits received from the exercise of stock options of million and decreased repayments of an equipment loan of approximately million 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  the cash generated from our initial public offering and cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months 

table of contents year ended december   compared to the year ended december  cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is primarily due to income derived from increased volume from transactions and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses balances partially offset by an increase to accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets as well as an increase to tax benefit from stock option exercises 
income and accounts receivable grew primarily due to increased volume from transactions and timing of collections of customer accounts 
the accounts payable and accrued expenses accounts grew partially due to increased expenses necessary to support higher revenues as well as capital expenditures necessary to continue to grow our business 
cash flows from investing 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash used of million for the year ended december  the increase of million was due to the increased purchase of fixed assets of million and net maturities of marketable securities 
cash flows from financing 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash provided of million for the year ended december  the difference of million was primarily due to net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock sold in our initial public offering completed in with no corresponding equity sale in effect of inflation although inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and equipment  we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our results of operations during  and contractual obligations our commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space  automobiles  computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations other long term liabilities total amount represents unrecognized tax positions recorded in our balance sheet 
although the timing of the settlement is uncertain  we believe this amount will be settled within years 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued statement  fair value measurements statement 
statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and establishes a hierarchy that categorizes and prioritizes the sources to be used to estimate fair value 
statement also expands financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements 
on february   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas effective date of statement no 
which delays the effective date of statement for one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we have elected a partial deferral of statement under the provisions of fsp fas related to the measurement of fair value used when evaluating goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment and valuing asset retirement obligations and liabilities for exit or disposal activities 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  
table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
this statement amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
before this statement was issued  limited guidance existed for reporting noncontrolling interests 
as a result  considerable diversity in practice existed 
so called minority interests were reported in the consolidated statement of financial position as liabilities or in the mezzanine section between liabilities and equity 
this statement improves comparability by eliminating that diversity 
this statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  that is  january   for entities with calendar year ends 
earlier adoption is prohibited 
the effective date of this statement is the same as that of the related statement revised 
as there are no non controlling interest holders in any of our subsidiaries  this will not have an impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab amends and replaces question of section d 
of topic  share based payment 
sab expresses the views of the staff regarding the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with fasb statement no 
r  share based payment 
the use of the simplified method was scheduled to expire on december  sab extends the use of the simplified method for plain vanilla awards in certain situations 
we currently use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for share option grants as we do not have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate due to the limited period our equity shares have been publicly traded 
we will continue to use the simplified method until we have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate of expected term in accordance with sab in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  or sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
sfas no 
r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
sfas no 
r also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption of this standard is prohibited 
as sfas no 
r is adopted solely on a prospective basis  there will be no impact on our consolidated financial statements related to the company s acquisition of wisor 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we deposit our excess cash in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds and  we may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations on our marketable securities  however  such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of these investments 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short and long term investments in a variety of securities  which could include commercial paper  money market funds and corporate debt securities 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  and december  were invested in liquid money market accounts 
all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
we do not expect the current rate of inflation to have a material impact on our business 
the recent severe tightening of the credit markets  disruptions in the financial markets and challenging economic conditions have adversely affected the united states and world economies 
investors in many industry sectors have experienced substantial decreases in asset valuations and uncertain market liquidity 
furthermore  credit rating authorities have  in many cases  been slow to respond to the rapid changes in the underlying value of certain securities and pervasive market illiquidity  regarding these securities 
as a result  this credit crisis may have a potential impact on the determination of the fair value of financial instruments or possibly require impairments in the future should the value of certain investments suffer a decline in value which is determined to be other than temporary 
we currently do not believe any change in the market value of our money market funds or other investments to be material or warrant a change in valuation
