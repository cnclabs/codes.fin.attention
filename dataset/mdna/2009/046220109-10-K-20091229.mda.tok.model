table of contents part i item business 
overview asta funding  inc  together with its wholly owned significant operating subsidiaries palisades collection llc  palisades acquisition xvi  llc palisades xvi  vativ recovery solutions llc vativ and other subsidiaries  not all wholly owned  and not considered material the company is engaged in the business of purchasing  and managing for its own account  distressed consumer receivables  including charged off receivables  semi performing receivables and performing receivables 
primary charged off receivables are accounts that have been written off by the originators and may have been previously serviced by collection agencies 
semi performing receivables are accounts where the debtor is currently making partial or irregular monthly payments  but the accounts may have been written off by the originators 
performing receivables are accounts where the debtor is making regular monthly payments that may or may not have been delinquent in the past 
distressed consumer receivables are the unpaid debts of individuals to banks  finance companies and other credit and service providers 
a large portion of the company s distressed consumer receivables are mastercard r  visa r and other credit card accounts which were charged off by the issuers or providers for non payment 
the company acquires these portfolios at substantial discounts from their face values 
the discounts are based on the characteristics issuer  account size  debtor location and age of debt of the underlying accounts of each portfolio 
we acquire these consumer receivable portfolios at a significant discount to the total amounts actually owed by the debtors 
we acquire these portfolios after a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the underlying receivables and calculate the purchase price so that our estimated cash flow offers us an adequate return on our investment after servicing expenses 
after purchasing a portfolio  we actively monitor its performance and review and adjust our collection and servicing strategies accordingly 
we purchase receivables from credit grantors and others through privately negotiated direct sales  brokered transactions and auctions in which sellers of receivables seek bids from several pre qualified debt purchasers 
these receivables consist primarily of mastercard r  visa r  private label and credit card accounts  among other types of receivables 
we pursue new acquisitions of consumer receivable portfolios from originators of consumer debt  on an ongoing basis through our relationships with industry participants  financial institutions  collection agencies  investors and our financing sources  brokers who specialize in the sale of consumer receivable portfolios  and other sources 
we fund portfolios through a combination of internally generated cash flow and bank debt 
our objective is to maximize our return on investment in acquired consumer receivable portfolios 
as a result  before acquiring a portfolio  we analyze the portfolio to determine how to best maximize collections in a cost efficient manner and decide whether to use our internal servicing and collection department  third party collection agencies  attorneys  or a combination of all three options 
when we outsource the servicing of receivables  our management typically determines the appropriate third party collection agencies and attorneys based on the type of receivables purchased 
once a group of receivables is sent to third party collection agencies and attorneys  our management actively monitors and reviews the third party collection agencies and attorneys performance on an ongoing basis 
based on portfolio performance considerations  our management either will move certain receivables from one third party collection agency or attorney to another or to our internal servicing department if it anticipates that this will result in an increase in collections  or it will sell portions of the portfolio accounts 
additionally  we have an internal collection unit  which currently employs approximately collection related staff  including senior management 
these employees assist us in benchmarking our third party collection agencies and attorneys  and give us greater flexibility for servicing a percentage of our consumer receivable portfolios in house 

table of contents for the years ended september   and  our finance income was approximately million  million and million  respectively  and our net loss income was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during these same years our net cash collections were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we were formed in as an affiliate of asta group  incorporated the family entity  an entity owned by arthur stern  our chairman emeritus  gary stern  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and other members of the stern family  to purchase  at a small discount to face value  retail installment sales contracts secured by motor vehicles 
we became a public company in november in  we decided to capitalize on our management s more than years of experience and expertise in acquiring and managing consumer receivable portfolios for the family entity 
as a result  we ceased purchasing automobile contracts and  with the assistance and financial support of the family entity and a partner  purchased our first significant consumer receivable portfolio 
since then  the family entity ceased acquiring consumer receivable portfolios and  accordingly  does not compete with us 
industry overview the purchasing  servicing and collection of charged off  semi performing and performing consumer receivables is an industry that is driven by increasing levels of consumer debt  increasing defaults of the underlying receivables  and increasing utilization of third party providers to collect such receivables 
strategy although we are in a challenging economic environment  our primary objective remains to utilize our management s experience and expertise by identifying  evaluating  pricing and acquiring consumer receivable portfolios and maximizing collections of such receivables in a cost efficient manner 
our strategy includes managing the collection and servicing of our consumer receivable portfolios  including outsourcing a majority of those activities to maintain low fixed overhead  although reduced pricing has slowed our capabilities  we seek to sell accounts on an opportunistic basis  generally when our efforts have been exhausted through traditional collecting methods  when pricing is at our indifference point  or when we can capitalize on pricing during times when we feel the pricing environment is high  and although we have purchased fewer consumer receivable portfolios than in recent years  we remain focused on capitalizing on our strategic relationships to identify and acquire consumer receivable portfolios as pricing  financing and conditions permit 
because our purchases of new portfolios of consumer receivables has been reduced  we expect to see a corresponding reduction in finance income in future quarters and future years  to the extent we have not replaced our receivables acquired for liquidation 
instead  we are focusing  in the short term  on reducing our debt and being highly disciplined in our portfolio purchases 
we continue to review potential portfolio acquisitions regularly and will buy at the right price  where we believe the purchase will yield our desired rate of return 
we believe as a result of our management s experience and expertise  and the fragmented yet growing market in which we operate  as we implement this short term strategy we will be in position to again grow the business when economic conditions stabilize 
we are a delaware corporation whose principal executive offices are located at sylvan avenue  englewood cliffs  new jersey we were incorporated in new jersey on july  and were reincorporated in delaware on october   as the result of a merger with a delaware corporation 

table of contents consumer receivables business receivables purchase program we purchase bulk receivable portfolios that include charged off receivables  semi performing receivables and performing receivables 
these receivables consist primarily of mastercard r  visa r and private label credit card accounts  among other types of receivables 
from time to time  we may acquire directly and indirectly  through the consumer receivable portfolios that we acquire  secured consumer asset portfolios  primarily receivables secured by automobiles 
we identify potential portfolio acquisitions on an ongoing basis through our relationships with industry participants  financial institutions  collection agencies  investors and our financing sources  brokers who specialize in the sale of consumer receivable portfolios  and other sources 
historically  the purchase prices of the consumer receivable portfolios we have acquired have ranged from less than  to approximately  however  we acquired one group of portfolios in march for million the portfolio purchase 
as a part of our strategy to acquire consumer receivable portfolios  we have  from time to time  entered into  and may continue to enter into  participation and profit sharing agreements with our sources of financing and our third party collection agencies and attorneys 
these arrangements may take the form of a joint bid  with one of our third party collection agencies and attorneys or financing sources who assists in the acquisition of a portfolio and provides us with more favorable non recourse financing terms or a discounted servicing commission 
current participation agreements include a sharing arrangement after the company has recouped of the cost of the portfolio purchase plus the cost of funds 
we utilize our relationships with brokers  third party collection agencies and attorneys  and sellers of portfolios to locate portfolios for purchase 
our senior management is responsible for coordinating due diligence  including  in some cases  on site visits to the seller s office  stratifying and analyzing the portfolio characteristics  valuing the portfolio  preparing bid proposals  negotiating pricing and terms  negotiating and executing a purchase contract  closing the purchase  and coordinating the receipt of account documentation for the acquired portfolios 
the seller or broker typically supplies us with either a sample listing or the actual portfolio being sold  through an electronic form of media 
we analyze each consumer receivable portfolio to determine if it meets our purchasing criteria 
we may then prepare a bid or negotiate a purchase price 
if a purchase is completed  management monitors the portfolio s performance and uses this information in determining future buying criteria including pricing 
an integral part of the acquisition process is the oversight by the investment committee 
this committee  established in january  must review and approve all investments above million in value 
voting criteria are more stringent as the size of the investment increases 
this is a four member committee composed of the chairman emeritus  the chief executive officer  the chief financial officer  and the senior vice president 
as the chairman emeritus and chief executive officer are related family members  at least one other officer must approve transactions 
after determining that an investment will yield an adequate return on our acquisition cost after servicing fees  including court costs  which are expensed as incurred  we use a variety of qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the estimated cash flows 
included in our analysis for purchasing a portfolio of receivables and 
table of contents determining a reasonable estimate of collections and the timing thereof  the following variables are analyzed and factored into our original estimates the number of collection agencies previously attempting to collect the receivables in the portfolio  the average balance of the receivables  the age of the receivables as older receivables might be more difficult to collect or might be less cost effective  past history of performance of similar assets as we purchase portfolios of similar assets  we believe we have built significant history on how these receivables will liquidate and cash flow  number of months since charge off  payments made since charge off  the credit originator and their credit guidelines  the locations of the debtors as there are better states to attempt to collect in and ultimately we have better predictability of the liquidations and the expected cash flows 
conversely  there are also states where the liquidation rates are not as good and that is factored into our cash flow analysis  financial wherewithal of the seller  jobs or property of the debtors found within portfolios with our business model  this is of particular importance 
debtors with jobs or property are more likely to repay their obligation and conversely  debtors without jobs or property are less likely to repay their obligation  and the ability to obtain customer statements from the original issuer 
we obtain and utilize  as appropriate  input including  but not limited to  monthly collection projections and liquidation rates from our third party collection agencies and attorneys  as further evidentiary matter  to assist us in developing collection strategies and in modeling the expected cash flows for a given portfolio 
once a receivable portfolio has been identified for potential purchase  we prepare various analyses based on extracting customer level data from external sources  other than the issuer  to analyze the potential collectability of the portfolio 
we also analyze the portfolio by comparing it to similar portfolios previously acquired by us 
in addition  we perform qualitative analyses of other matters affecting the value of portfolios  including a review of the delinquency  charge off  placement and recovery policies of the originator as well as the collection authority granted by the originator to any third party collection agencies  and  if possible  by reviewing their recovery efforts on the particular portfolio 
after these evaluations are completed  members of our senior management discuss the findings  decide whether to make the purchase and finalize the price at which we are willing to purchase the portfolio 
we purchase most of our consumer receivable portfolios directly from originators and other sellers including  from time to time  our third party collection agencies and attorneys  through privately negotiated direct sales and through auction type sales in which sellers of receivables seek bids from several pre qualified debt purchasers 
we also  from time to time  use the services of brokers for sourcing consumer receivable portfolios 
in order for us to consider a potential seller as a source of receivables  a variety of factors are considered 
sellers must demonstrate that they have adequate internal controls to detect fraud  the ability to provide post sale support  and the capacity to honor put back and return warranty requests 
generally  our portfolio purchase agreements provide that we can return certain accounts to the seller within a specified time period 
however  in some transactions  we may acquire a portfolio with few  if any  rights to return accounts to the seller 
after acquiring a portfolio  we conduct a detailed analysis to determine which accounts in the 
table of contents portfolio should be returned to the seller 
although the terms of each portfolio purchase agreement differ  examples of accounts that may be returned to the seller include debts paid prior to the cutoff date  debts in which the consumer filed bankruptcy prior to the cutoff date  debts in which the consumer was deceased prior to cutoff date  and fraudulent accounts 
accounts returned to sellers for fiscal years and have been determined to be immaterial 
our purchase agreements generally do not contain any provision for a limitation on the number of accounts that can be returned to the seller 
significant accounts returned to sellers for the fiscal year ended amounted to approximately million of investment for two portfolio purchases 
such accounts were non compliant accounts 
we generally use third parties to determine bankrupt and deceased accounts  allowing us to focus our resources on portfolio collections 
under a typical portfolio purchase agreement  the seller refunds the portion of the purchase price attributable to the returned accounts or delivers replacement receivables to us 
occasionally  we will acquire a well seasoned or older portfolio at a reduced price from a seller that is unable to meet all of our purchasing criteria 
when we acquire such portfolios  the purchase price is further discounted beyond the typical discounts we receive on the portfolios we purchase 
in  we acquired vativ  located in sugar land  texas 
vativ provides bankruptcy and deceased account servicing 
the acquisition of vativ provides the company with internal experience and proprietary systems in support of servicing our own bankruptcy and deceased accounts  while also affording us the opportunity to enter new markets for acquisitions in the bankruptcy and deceased account fields 
receivable servicing our objective is to maximize our return on investment on acquired consumer receivable portfolios 
as a result  before acquiring a portfolio  we analyze the portfolio to determine how to best maximize collections in a cost efficient manner and decide whether to use a third party collection agency or an attorney 
therefore  if we are successful in acquiring the portfolio  we can promptly process the receivables that were purchased and commence the collection process 
unlike collection agencies that typically have only a specified period of time to recover a receivable  as the portfolio owners  we have significantly more flexibility and can establish payment programs 
once a portfolio has been acquired  we generally download all receivable information provided by the seller into our account management system and reconcile certain information with the information provided by the seller in the purchase contract 
we  or our third party collection agencies or attorneys  send notification letters to obligors of each acquired account explaining  among other matters  our new ownership and asking that the obligor contact us 
in addition  we notify the three major credit reporting agencies of our new ownership of the receivables 
we presently outsource the majority of our receivable servicing to third party collection agencies and attorneys 
our senior management typically determines the appropriate third party collection agency and attorney based on the type of receivables purchased 
once a group of receivables is sent to a third party collection agency or attorney  our management actively monitors and reviews the third party collection agency s and attorney s performance on an ongoing basis 
our management receives detailed analyses  including collection activity and portfolio performance  from our internal servicing departments for the purpose of evaluating the results of the efforts of the third party collection agencies and attorneys 
based on portfolio performance guidelines  our management will reassign certain receivables from one third party collection agency or attorney to another if we believe such change will enhance collections 
at september  approximately of our portfolios were serviced by five collection organizations 
we have servicing agreements in place with these five collection organizations as well as all other third party 
table of contents collection agencies and attorneys 
these servicing agreements cover standard contingency fees and servicing of the accounts 
we have three main internal servicing departments collection skiptrace  customer service  and accounting and finance 
collection skiptrace 
the collection skiptrace department is responsible for making contact with the debtors and collecting on our consumer receivable portfolios that are not being serviced by third party collection agencies and attorneys 
this department uses a friendly  customer service approach to collect on receivables 
through the use of our collection software and telephone system  each collector is responsible for contacting customers  explaining the benefits of making payment on the obligations  and working with the customers to develop acceptable means to satisfy their obligations 
we and our third party collection agencies and attorneys have the flexibility to structure repayment plans that accommodate the needs of obligors by offering obligors a discount on the overall obligation  and or tailoring repayment plans that provide for the payment of these obligations as a component of the obligor s monthly budget 
we also use a series of collection letters  late payment reminders  and settlement offers that are sent out at specific intervals or at the request of a member of our collection department 
when the collection department cannot contact the customer by either telephone or mail  the account is referred to the skiptrace department 
the skiptrace department is responsible for locating and contacting customers who could not be contacted by either the collection or legal departments 
the skiptrace employees use a variety of public and private third party databases to locate customers 
once a customer is located and contact is made by a skiptracer  the account is then referred back to the collection or legal department for follow up 
the skiptrace department is also responsible for finding current employers and locating assets of obligors when this information is deemed necessary 
customer service 
the customer service department is responsible for handling incoming calls from debtors and third party collection agencies  coordinating customer inquiries and assisting the collection agencies in the collection process  handling buy back and information requests from companies that have purchased receivables from us  working with the buyers during the transition period and post sale process  and handling any issues that may arise once a receivable portfolio has been sold 
accounting and finance 
in addition to the customary accounting activities  the accounting and finance department is responsible for making daily deposits of debtor payments  posting these payments to each debtor s account  and in conjunction with the customer service department  providing senior management with daily  weekly and monthly receivable activity and performance reports 
accounting and finance employees also assist collection department employees in handling customer disputes with regard to payment and balance information 
the accounting department also assists the customer service department in the handling of buy back requests from companies which have purchased receivables from us 
in 
table of contents addition  the accounting department reviews the results of the collection of consumer receivable portfolios that are being serviced by third party collection agencies and attorneys 
collections represented by account sales certain collections represent account sales to other debt buyers to help maximize revenue and cash flows 
we believe that our business model of not having a large number of collectors  coupled with a legal strategy which is focused on attempting to perfect liens and judgments against obligors  allows us the flexibility to sell accounts at prices that are attractive to us  and  just as important  sell the less desirable accounts within our collection portfolios 
there are many factors that contribute to the decision as to which receivable to sell and which to service  including the age of the receivables  the status of the receivables whether paying or non paying  and the selling price 
net collections represented by account sales for the fiscal years ended september   and were million  million and million  respectively 
collections represented by account sales as a percentage of total collections for the fiscal years ended september   and were  and  respectively 
marketing the company has established relationships with brokers who market consumer receivable portfolios from banks  finance companies and other credit providers 
in addition  the company subscribes to national publications that list consumer receivable portfolios for sale 
the company also directly contacts banks  finance companies or other credit providers to solicit consumer receivables for sale 
competition our business of purchasing distressed consumer receivables is highly competitive and fragmented  and we expect that competition from new and existing companies will continue 
we compete with other purchasers of consumer receivables  including third party collection companies  and other financial services companies who purchase consumer receivables 
some of our competitors are larger and more established and may have substantially greater financial  technological  personnel and other resources than we have  including greater access to the capital market system 
we believe that no individual competitor or group of competitors has a dominant presence in the market 
we compete in the marketplace for consumer receivable portfolios based on many factors  including purchase price  representations  warranties and indemnities requested  timeliness of purchase decisions  and reputation of the purchaser 
our strategy is designed to capitalize on the market s lack of a dominant industry player 
we believe that our management s experience and expertise in identifying  evaluating  pricing and acquiring consumer receivable portfolios and managing collections  coupled with our strategic alliances with third party collection agencies and attorneys and our sources of financing  give us a competitive advantage 
however  we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not increase in the future 

table of contents technology we believe that a high degree of automation is necessary to enable us to grow and successfully compete with other finance companies 
accordingly  we continually look to upgrade our technology systems to support the servicing and recovery of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation 
our telecommunications and technology systems allow us to quickly and accurately process large amounts of data necessary to purchase and service consumer receivable portfolios 
in addition  we rely on the information technology of our third party collection agencies and attorneys and periodically review their systems to ensure that they can adequately service the consumer receivable portfolios outsourced to them 
due to our desire to increase productivity through automation  we periodically review our systems for possible upgrades and enhancements 
government regulation the relationship of a consumer and a creditor is extensively regulated by federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and ordinances 
these laws include  but are not limited to  the following federal statutes and regulations the federal truth in lending act  the fair credit billing act  the equal credit opportunity act and the fair credit reporting act  as well as comparable statutes in states where consumers reside and or where creditors are located 
among other things  the laws and regulations applicable to various creditors impose disclosure requirements regarding the advertisement  application  establishment and operation of credit card accounts or other types of credit programs 
federal law requires a creditor to disclose to consumers  among other things  the interest rates  fees  grace periods and balance calculation methods associated with their accounts 
in addition  consumers are entitled to have payments and credits applied to their accounts promptly  to receive prescribed notices and to request that billing errors be resolved promptly 
in addition  some laws prohibit certain discriminatory practices in connection with the extension of credit 
further  state laws may limit the interest rate and the fees that a creditor may impose on consumers 
failure by the creditors to comply with applicable laws could create claims and rights of offset by consumers that would reduce or eliminate their obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
pursuant to agreements under which we purchase receivables  we are typically indemnified against losses resulting from the failure of the creditor to have complied with applicable laws relating to the receivables prior to our purchase of such receivables 
certain laws  including the laws described above  may limit our ability to collect amounts owing with respect to the receivables regardless of any act or omission on our part 
for example  under the federal fair credit billing act  a credit card issuer may be subject to certain claims and defenses arising out of certain transactions in which a credit card is used if the consumer has made a good faith attempt to obtain satisfactory resolution of a problem relative to the transaction and  except in cases where there is a specified relationship between the person honoring the card and the credit card issuer  the amount of the initial transaction exceeds and the place where the initial transaction occurred was in the same state as the consumer s billing address or within miles of that address 
accordingly  as a purchaser of defaulted receivables  we may purchase receivables subject to valid defenses on the part of the consumer 
other laws provide that  in certain instances  consumers cannot be held liable for  or their liability is limited to with respect to  charges to the credit card credit account that were a result of an unauthorized use of the credit card account 
no assurances can be given that certain of the receivables were not established as a result of unauthorized use of a credit card account  and  accordingly  the amount of such receivables may not be collectible by us 
several federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and ordinances  including  but not limited to  the federal fair debt collection practices act fdcpa and the federal trade commission act and comparable state statutes  regulate consumer debt collection activity 
although  for a variety of reasons  we may not be specifically subject to the fdcpa or certain state statutes that govern third party debt collectors  it is our policy to comply with applicable laws in our collection activities 
additionally  our third party collection agencies and attorneys may be subject to these laws 
to the extent that some or all of these laws apply to our collection activities or our third party collection agencies and attorneys collection activities  failure to comply with such laws could have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents additional laws  or amendments to existing laws  may be enacted that could impose additional restrictions on the servicing and collection of receivables 
such new laws or amendments may adversely affect our ability to collect the receivables 
we currently hold a number of licenses issued under applicable consumer credit laws or other licensing statutes or regulations 
certain of our current licenses  and any licenses that we may be required to obtain in the future  may be subject to periodic renewal provisions and or other requirements 
our inability to renew licenses or to take any other required action with respect to such licenses could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operation and financial condition

risk factors 
you should carefully consider these risk factors in evaluating the company 
in addition to the following risks  there may also be risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial that may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  results of operation or financial condition could be adversely effected  the trading price of our common stock could decline and shareholders might lose all or part of their investment 
we have recently recorded substantial impairments losses in the value of our portfolios we have recorded impairments on the value of our portfolios of million in fiscal and million in fiscal year the impairments are the primary reason for the million loss in fiscal year while we believe we have written down the impaired portfolios to their net reliazable values  no assurances can be given that we will not record additional impairments in the future 
our current financing facility is a twelve month facility of million which will limit our ability to purchase larger portfolios of consumer receivables 
our revolving credit facility with israel discount bank idb  as agent for a consortium of banks the bank group  would have been due on december  the balance of the credit line had been paid down from a principal balance of approximately million at september  to million at september  and further reduced to million on november  on december  the company entered into a new million senior revolving credit agreement with bank leumi new senior facility 
a portion of the new senior facility was used to pay off the remaining balance of the idb credit facility 
the new senior facility has a maturity date of december   carries an interest rate of the bank leumi reference rate plus with a floor of 
the new senior facility is fully collateralized by all of the assets of the company other than those of palisades xvi and pledged assets of gms family investors  llc an investment company owned by members of the stern family or trusts for their benefit 
there are no financial covenant restrictions for the new senior facility 
approximately million was immediately available on the new senior facility after the liquidation of the credit facility with idb 
although a line of credit is important for strategic purposes  a larger facility would not be a requirement for us to continue to operate and purchase consumer receivable portfolios 
however  we may be limited in our efforts to make larger purchases without additional financing 

table of contents the company has risks associated with its purchase of billion in face value of receivables purchased for million in march the portfolio purchase which has not met our expectations 
since the inception of the portfolio purchase financed by the receivables financing agreement  the receivables financing agreement has been modified four times due to collections not meeting our expectations 
the portfolio purchase has not met our expectations  and the shortfall has been exacerbated by the general economic down turn 
we have recorded impairments on the portfolio purchase totaling million million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year 
the portfolio purchase was transferred to the cost recovery method effective with the third quarter of fiscal year  as collections became increasingly more difficult to predict 
accordingly  we will recognize income only after we recover our carrying value  which  as of september   was approximately million 
as a result  our revenue since april  has been and will continue to be negatively impacted 
there can be no assurance as to when or if the current carrying value will be recovered 
further  all cash collections from the portfolio purchase are used to repay our loan under the receivable financing agreement  which had a principal balance of million at september  we may not be able be to timely satisfy all amounts due to bank of montreal under the receivables financing agreement pursuant to the receivables financing agreement  palisades xvi borrowed approximately million in march as of september  the balance due bank of montreal bmo was million 
the loan matures on april  unless the outstanding balance is reduced to million  or less by that date 
it is likely we will not be able to reduce the balance of the facility to million by april  the collateral held by palisades xvi has a book value at september  of million after recent impairments 
the company has servicing obligations with respect to the collateral as well as certain obligations to assist bmo in any liquidation of that collateral 
if we are unable to repay the loan due to bmo  or extend it automatically for one year if the balance is million or less  or through negotiation the company may be obligated to bmo on its million limited guarantee which is not due until as long as we have a senior facility  currently the new senior facility 
the company may also be obligated to the family entity for  there can be no assurance that bmo will not seek to take other action against the company if the loan is not repaid when due 
the company will be applying for a federal tax refund of approximately million upon filing the tax return for fiscal year and may not receive such refund in a timely manner 
due to the significance of the application request  the internal revenue service irs process could take a considerable amount of time and we may not receive the refund in a timely manner which could impact operations if we were considering acquiring a portfolio with a significant purchase price 
in addition  there can be no assurance the irs will not challenge our refund request 
there is no assurance the company will realize the full value of the deferred tax asset 
although the carry forward period for income taxes is up to twenty years  such allowance period is outside a reasonable period to forecast full realization of the deferred tax asset 
the company recognized a million deferred tax asset allowance during fiscal year the company continually monitors forecast information to ensure the valuation allowance is appropriate 
the current economic environment has slowed our ability to collect from our debtors 
the recent worldwide financial turmoil has adversely affected all businesses  including our own 
the current collection environment is particularly challenging as a result of factors in the economy over which we have no control 
these factors include a slowdown in the economy  severe problems in the credit and housing markets  higher unemployment  
table of contents reductions in consumer spending  changes in the underwriting criteria by originators  and changes in laws and regulations governing consumer lending and the related collections 
our litigation strategy is highly dependent on our ability to locate debtors with jobs and or homes 
we believe that our debtors are straining to pay their obligations owed to us 
higher unemployment rates particularly impact our debtors ability to pay obligations and our ability to get wage executions as a source of payment 
problems in the credit markets and lower home values have reduced the ability of our debtors to secure financing through second mortgages and home equity lines to pay obligations owed to us 
a continuation of the current problems in the credit and housing markets and general slowdown in the economy will continue to adversely affect the effectiveness of our litigation strategy  and the value of our portfolios and our financial performance 
we may not be able to purchase consumer receivable portfolios at favorable prices or on sufficiently favorable terms or at all 
our success depends upon the continued availability of consumer receivable portfolios that meet our purchasing criteria and our ability to identify and finance the purchases of such portfolios 
the availability of consumer receivable portfolios at favorable prices and on terms acceptable to us depends on a number of factors outside of our control  including the growth in consumer debt  the volume of consumer receivable portfolios available for sale  availability of financing to fund purchases  competitive factors affecting potential purchasers and sellers of consumer receivable portfolios  and possible future changes in the bankruptcy laws  state laws and homestead acts which could make it more difficult for us to collect 
our future operating results will be negatively impacted as we have not replaced our defaulted consumer receivables at historic levels 
to operate profitably  we must continually acquire a sufficient amount of distressed consumer receivables to generate continued revenue 
our buying activities during fiscal year and the last three quarters of fiscal year slowed dramatically 
as the economic environment deteriorated  we felt that pricing of portfolios had not fallen enough to offset the decline in ultimate collections 
accordingly  our purchases of receivables in were only million  compared to million in and million in in part  this led to our net cash collections in fiscal decreasing million  or from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year further  of those collections  million for fiscal year and million for fiscal period came from zero basis portfolios whose carrying value has already been reduced to zero 
our decreased level of buying new portfolios during and will likely result in future reduced net cash collections in and slow the growth of our future revenues and operating results 
furthermore  we cannot predict how our ability to identify and purchase receivables  and evaluate the quality of those receivables  would be affected if there is a shift in consumer lending practices whether caused by changes in regulations or by a sustained economic downturn 
our inability to purchase sufficient quantities of receivables portfolios may necessitate workforce reductions  which may harm our business 
because fixed costs  such as personnel costs  constitute a significant portion of our overhead  we may be required to reduce the number of employees if we do not continually purchase receivables acquired for liquidation 
reducing the number of employees can affect our business adversely and lead to lower employee morale  higher employee attrition rates and fewer experienced employees  
table of contents disruptions in our operations and loss of efficiency in collection functions  excess costs associated with unused space in collection facilities  and further reliance on our third party collection agencies and attorneys 
we have seen at certain times that the market for acquiring consumer receivable portfolios has become more competitive  thereby diminishing from time to time our ability to acquire such receivables at prices we are willing to pay 
the growth in consumer debt may also be affected by the continuation of a slowdown in the economy  continuation of the problems in the credit and housing markets  reductions in consumer spending  changes in the underwriting criteria by originators  and changes in laws and regulations governing consumer lending 
any slowing of the consumer debt growth trend could result in a decrease in the availability of consumer receivable portfolios for purchase that could affect the purchase prices of such portfolios 
any increase in the prices we are required to pay for such portfolios  in turn  will reduce the profit we generate from such portfolios 
with portfolios classified under the interest method  our projections of future cash flows from our portfolio purchases may prove to be inaccurate  which could result in reduced revenues or the recording of impairment charges if we do not achieve the collections forecasted by our model 
we use qualitative and quantitative analyses to project future cash flows from our portfolio purchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to achieve the collections forecasted by our analysis 
if we are not able to achieve these levels of forecasted collections  our revenues will be reduced and we may be required to record additional impairment charges  which would result in a reduction of our earnings 
for the year ended september   we recorded impairment charges of million  compared to million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
as the mix of our portfolios has shifted to the cost recovery method  there is a negative impact on finance income as no finance income is recognized on the cost recovery portfolios until the carrying value has been recovered 
historically we have utilized the interest method to recognize finance income on most consumer receivable portfolios purchased 
as the economy has impacted our business  making collections more unpredictable  we have transferred portfolios from the interest method to the cost recovery method  which delays the recognition of finance until the carrying value has been fully recovered 
we use estimates for recognizing finance income on a portion of our consumer receivables acquired for liquidation and our earnings would be reduced if actual results are less than estimated 
we utilize the interest method of revenue recognition for determining a portion of our finance income recognized  which is based on projected cash flows that may prove to be less than anticipated and could lead to reductions in revenue or additional impairment charges under fasb accounting standard codification asc  receivables loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality  asc 
static pools of accounts are established 
these pools are aggregated based on certain common risk criteria 
each static pool is recorded at cost and is accounted for as a single unit for the recognition of income  principal payments and loss provision 
once a static pool is established for a quarter  individual receivable accounts are not added to the pool unless replaced by the seller or removed from the pool unless sold or returned to the seller 
asc requires that the excess of the contractual cash flows over expected cash flows not be recognized as an adjustment of revenue or expense or on the balance sheet 
asc initially freezes the internal rate of return  irr  estimated 
table of contents when the accounts receivable are purchased  as the basis for subsequent impairment testing 
significant increases in actual  or expected future cash flows may be recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the irr over a portfolio s remaining life 
any increase to the irr then becomes the new benchmark for impairment testing 
rather than lowering the estimated irr if the collection estimates are not received or projected to be received  the carrying value of a pool would be written down to maintain the then current irr 
any reduction in our earnings resulting from such a write down could materially adversely affect our stock price 
we may not be able to collect sufficient amounts on our consumer receivable portfolios to recover the costs associated with the purchase of those portfolios and to fund our operations 
we acquire and collect on consumer receivable portfolios that contain charged off  semi performing and performing receivables 
in order to operate profitably over the long term  we must continually purchase and collect on a sufficient volume of receivables to generate revenue that exceeds our purchase costs 
for accounts that are charged off or semi performing  the originators or interim owners of the receivables generally have made numerous attempts to collect on these obligations  often using both their in house collection staff and third party collection agencies  and subsequently deemed these obligations as uncollectible these receivable portfolios are purchased at significant discounts to the amount the consumers owe 
these receivables are difficult to collect and actual recoveries may vary and be less than the amount expected 
in addition  our collections may worsen in a weak economic cycle 
we may not recover amounts in excess of our acquisition and servicing costs 
our ability to recover the purchase costs on our portfolios and produce sufficient returns can be negatively impacted by the quality of the purchased receivables 
in the normal course of our portfolio acquisitions  some receivables may be included in the portfolios that fail to conform to certain terms of the purchase agreements and we may seek to return these receivables to the seller for payment or replacement receivables 
however  we cannot guarantee that any of such sellers will be able to meet their payment obligations to us 
accounts that we are unable to return to sellers may yield no return 
if cash flows from operations are less than anticipated as a result of our inability to collect sufficient amounts on our receivables  our ability to satisfy our debt obligations  purchase new portfolios and achieve future growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to competition for the purchase of consumer receivable portfolios 
we compete with other purchasers of consumer receivable portfolios  with third party collection agencies and with financial services companies that manage their own consumer receivable portfolios 
we compete on the basis of price  reputation  industry experience and performance 
some of our competitors have greater capital  personnel and other resources than we have 
the possible entry of new competitors  including competitors that historically have focused on the acquisition of different asset types  and the expected increase in competition from current market participants may reduce our access to consumer receivable portfolios 
aggressive pricing by our competitors has raised the price of consumer receivable portfolios above levels that we are willing to pay  which could reduce the number of consumer receivable portfolios suitable for us to purchase or if purchased by us  reduce the profits  if any  generated by such portfolios 
if we are unable to purchase receivable portfolios at favorable prices or at all  our finance income and earnings could be materially reduced 
we are dependent upon third parties to service a majority of our consumer receivable portfolios 
although we utilize our in house collection staff to initiate the collection process to collect some of our receivables  we outsource a majority of our receivable servicing 
as a result  we are dependent upon the efforts of our third party collection agencies and attorneys to service and collect our consumer receivables 
however  any failure by our third party collection agencies and attorneys to adequately perform collection services for us or remit such collections to us could materially reduce our finance income and our profitability 
in addition  our finance income and profitability could be materially adversely affected if we are not able to secure replacement third party collection agencies and attorneys and redirect payments from the debtors to our new third party collection agencies and attorneys promptly in the event our agreements with our third party collection agencies and attorneys are 
table of contents terminated  our third party collection agencies and attorneys fail to adequately perform their obligations or if our relationships with such third party collection agencies and attorneys adversely change 
as of our portfolios are serviced by five organizations  we are dependent on them to maximize collections 
the current economic environment has had adverse effects on others in this industry  including parties providing services to us 
the current economic environment has had an adverse effect on others in our industry 
one of our five most significant third party servicers recently filed a bankruptcy proceeding and will be liquidating 
we have taken steps in that servicer s bankruptcy proceeding intended to ensure that our collections continue to be segregated and timely remitted 
we have received the consent of the bankruptcy court to move our accounts to another servicer 
we are in the process of moving our accounts to another servicer with whom we have experience 
in addition  a law firm used by the bankrupt servicer has advised us that it is in financial difficulty and will be closing 
that law firm is assisting in transitioning the accounts to the new servicer and has advised us that it will consent to substitute other counsel in its place 
the replacement servicer will be taking steps to arrange for the substitution of counsel 
notwithstanding the efforts of various parties to provide for a conversion of the accounts to the new servicer  these occurrences could interfere with the collection of certain of our portfolios including the ability of judgment debtors to identify asta  the new servicer or new counsel as the parties to whom they should direct payments 
in addition  representatives of creditors of the insolvent servicer and troubled law firm may endeavor to assert claims with respect to portfolios that those companies relinquish including our accounts 
we rely on our third party collectors to comply with all rules and regulations and maintain proper internal controls over their accounting and operations 
because the receivables were originated and serviced pursuant to a variety of federal and or state laws by a variety of entities and involved consumers in all states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and south america  there can be no assurance that all original servicing entities have  at all times  been in substantial compliance with applicable law 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we or our third party collection agencies and attorneys have been or will continue to be at all times in substantial compliance with applicable law 
the failure to comply with applicable law and not maintain proper controls in their accounting and operations could materially adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables and could subject us to increased costs  fines and penalties 
we may rely on third parties to locate  identify and evaluate consumer receivable portfolios available for purchase 
we may rely on third parties  including brokers and third party collection agencies and attorneys  to identify consumer receivable portfolios and  in some instances  to assist us in our evaluation and purchase of these portfolios 
as a result  if such third parties fail to identify receivable portfolios or if our relationships with such third parties are not maintained  our ability to identify and purchase additional receivable portfolios could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if we  or such parties  fail to correctly or adequately evaluate the value or collectability of these consumer receivable portfolios  we may pay too much for such portfolios and suffer an impairment  which would negatively impact our earnings 
business issues with a significant third party servicer the servicer led to the need to secure subordinated financing  reduced purchases and other disruptions in the business relationship 
the servicer that provides servicing for certain portfolios within the bank group collateral all portfolios excluding the portfolio purchase  was also engaged by palisades collection  llc  the company s servicing subsidiary palisades collection  after the acquisition of the portfolio purchase  to provide certain management services with respect to the portfolios owned by palisades xvi and financed by the bmo facility and to provide subservicing functions for portions of the portfolio purchase 
collections with respect to the portfolio purchase  and most portfolios purchased by the company  are less than the costs and fees which were expended to generate those collections  particularly when court costs are advanced to pursue an aggressive litigation strategy  as was the case with the portfolio purchase 
start up cash flow issues with respect to the portfolio purchase were exacerbated by a collection challenges caused by the economic environment  b the fact that palisades collection believed that it 
table of contents would be desirable to engage the servicer to perform management services with respect to the portfolio purchase which services were not contemplated at the time of the initial acquisition of the portfolio purchase and c palisades collection believed it would be desirable to commence litigation and incur court costs at a faster rate than initially budgeted 
as previously described in the company s form k and form k a for the year ended september   the agreements with the servicer call for a fee on substantially all gross collections from the portfolio purchase on the first million and on substantially all gross collections from the portfolio purchase in excess of million 
additionally  the company paid the servicer a monthly fee of  for months for consulting  asset identification and skiptracing efforts in connection with the portfolio purchase  ending in may the servicer also receives a servicing fee with respect to those accounts it actually subservices 
as the fees due to the servicer for management and subservicing functions and the amounts spent for court costs were higher than those initially contemplated for subservicing functions  and as start up collections with respect to the portfolio purchase were slower than initially projected  the amounts owed to the servicer with respect to the portfolio purchase for fees and advances for court costs to pursue litigation against debtors  from time to time  exceeded amounts available to pay the servicer from collections received by the servicer on the portfolio purchase on a current basis 
the company considered the effects of these trends on the portfolio purchase valuation 
rather than waiting for collections from the portfolio purchase to satisfy sums of approximately million due the servicer for court cost advances and its fees  the servicer set off that amount against amounts it had collected on behalf of the company with respect to the bank group collateral 
while the servicer disagrees  the company believes that those sums should have been remitted to the bank group without setoff 
the company determined to remedy any shortfall in the receipts under the bank group facility by obtaining the million subordinated loan from the family entity and causing the proceeds of the loan to be delivered to the bank group and not to pursue a dispute with the servicer at that time 
the company believed that avoiding a dispute with the servicer was is in its best interests  as the servicer should improve collections on the portfolio purchase over time 
on april   the company entered into a letter agreement with the bank group in which the bank group consented to the subordinated loan from the family entity 
on january   the company entered into amended agreements with the servicer pursuant to which the servicer agreed that it would not make any further set offs against collections 
we have an ongoing dispute with a significant servicer for which we are currently negotiating a settlement 
the company has an ongoing dispute with one of its significant third party servicers regarding certain provisions in the servicing agreement between the companies 
the company contends that there are amounts due the company under a profit sharing arrangement 
the servicer has acknowledged the profit sharing arrangement but disagrees with the calculation of the amount owed 
additionally  the servicer has asserted that the company owes the servicer certain amounts with regard to a portfolio sale and court costs allegedly incurred by the servicer and not paid to the servicer by the company 
the companies continue to negotiate a settlement for these items 
the company does not believe the final settlement will have an adverse material effect on the company 
our collections may decrease if bankruptcy filings increase 
during times of economic recession  the amount of defaulted consumer receivables generally increases  which contributes to an increase in the amount of personal bankruptcy filings 
under certain bankruptcy filings  a debtor s assets are sold to repay credit originators  but since the defaulted consumer receivables we purchase are generally unsecured  we may not be able to collect on those receivables 
we cannot assure you that our collection experience would not decline with an increase in bankruptcy filings 
if our actual collection experience with respect to a defaulted consumer receivable portfolio is significantly lower than we projected when we purchased the portfolio  our earnings could be negatively affected 
if we are unable to access external sources of financing  we may not be able to fund and grow our operations 
the failure to obtain increased financing and capital as needed would limit our ability to purchase consumer receivable portfolios  and achieve our growth plans 

table of contents in addition  our financing sources may impose certain restrictive covenants  including financial covenants 
failure to satisfy any of these covenants could cause our indebtedness to become immediately payable  preclude us from further borrowings from these existing sources  and prevent us from securing alternative sources of financing necessary to purchase consumer receivable portfolios and to operate our business 
the loss of any of our executive officers may adversely affect our operations and our ability to successfully acquire receivable portfolios 
historically  arthur stern  our chairman emeritus  gary stern  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  robert j 
michel  our chief financial officer  and mary curtin  our senior vice president  were responsible for making substantially all management decisions  including determining which portfolios to purchase  the purchase price and other material terms of such portfolio acquisitions 
these decisions are instrumental to the success of our business 
on october   it was announced that cameron williams  who had served as chief operating officer  will be leaving the company following a transition period 
mr 
williams contract expires december  additionally  as of january  arthur stern stepped down as an employee of the company  although he continues to serve on the board and to consult with our executives 
significant losses of the services of our executive officers or the inability to replace our officers with individuals who have experience in the industry or with the company could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our ability to successfully acquire receivable portfolios 
the stern family effectively controls asta  substantially reducing the influence of our other stockholders 
members of the stern family including arthur stern  gary stern and barbara marburger  daughter of arthur stern and sister of gary stern  trusts or custodial accounts for the benefit of minor children of barbara marburger and gary stern  asta group  incorporated  and limited liability companies controlled by judith r 
feder  niece of arthur stern and cousin of gary stern  in which arthur stern  alice stern wife of arthur stern and mother of gary stern and barbara marburger  gary stern and trusts for the benefit of the issue of arthur stern and the issue of gary stern hold all economic interests  own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
in addition  other members of the stern family  such as adult children of gary stern and barbara marburger  own additional shares 
as a result  the stern family is able to influence significantly the actions that require stockholder approval  including the election of a majority of our directors  and the approval of mergers  sales of assets or other corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval 
as a result  our other stockholders may have reduced influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval 
in addition  the stern family s influence could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us and consequently materially adversely affect the price of our common stock 
current economic conditions  have had a significant impact on our ability to sell accounts 
as part of our historic business model  we have sold accounts on an opportunistic basis 
our ability to sell accounts has been limited in and in and may be limited in the future 
net collections represented by account sales for were only million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
collections represented by account sales as a percentage of total collections were in  compared to and in and  respectively 
we had launched a sales effort to enhance cash flow and pay debt  particularly from the portfolio purchase  but sales have been slower than expected due to a variety of factors  including a slow resale market  similar to the decrease in pricing we are seeing in general  as well as lack of supporting documentation media and validation of the portfolio purchase accounts 
government regulations may limit our ability to recover and enforce the collection of our receivables 
federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and ordinances may limit our ability to recover and enforce our rights with respect to the receivables acquired by us 
these laws include  but are not limited to  the following federal 
table of contents statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder and comparable statutes in states where consumers reside and or where creditors are located the fair debt collection practices act  the federal trade commission act  the truth in lending act  the fair credit billing act  the equal credit opportunity act  and the fair credit reporting act 
we may be precluded from collecting receivables we purchase where the creditor or other previous owner or third party collection agency or attorney failed to comply with applicable law in originating or servicing such acquired receivables 
laws relating to the collection of consumer debt also directly apply to our business 
our failure to comply with any laws applicable to us  including state licensing laws  could limit our ability to recover on receivables and could subject us to fines and penalties  which could reduce our earnings and result in a default under our loan arrangements 
in addition  our third party collection agencies and attorneys may be subject to these and other laws and their failure to comply with such laws could also materially adversely affect our finance income and earnings 
additional laws or amendments to existing laws may be enacted that could impose additional restrictions on the servicing and collection of receivables 
such new laws or amendments may adversely affect the ability to collect on our receivables  which could also adversely affect our finance income and earnings 
because our receivables are generally originated and serviced pursuant to a variety of federal  state laws and or local laws by a variety of entities and may involve consumers in all states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and south america  there can be no assurance that all originating and servicing entities have  at all times  been in substantial compliance with applicable law 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we or our third party collection agencies and attorneys have been or will continue to be at all times in substantial compliance with applicable law 
failure to comply with applicable law could materially adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables and could subject us to increased costs  fines and penalties 
class action suits and other litigation in our industry could divert our management s attention from operating our business and increase our expenses 
originators  debt purchasers and third party collection agencies and attorneys in the consumer credit industry are frequently subject to putative class action lawsuits and other litigation 
claims include failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations and improper or deceptive origination and servicing practices 
being a defendant in such class action lawsuits or other litigation could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may seek to make acquisitions that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources 
we may seek to grow asta through acquisitions of related businesses 
such acquisitions present risks that could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance  including the diversion of our management s attention from our everyday business activities  the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired business  the contingent and latent risks associated with the past operations of  and other unanticipated problems arising in  the acquired business  and the need to expand management  administration and operational systems 
if we make such acquisitions we cannot predict whether we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any new businesses into our business  we will realize any anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions  or there will be substantial unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions 
in addition  future acquisitions by us may result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities  
table of contents the incurrence of additional debt  and the recognition of significant charges for depreciation and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
although we have no present plans or intentions  we continuously evaluate potential acquisitions of related businesses 
however  we have not reached any agreement or arrangement with respect to any particular future acquisition and we may not be able to complete any acquisitions on favorable terms or at all 
our investments in other businesses and entry into new business ventures may adversely affect our operations 
we have and may continue to make investments in companies or commence operations in businesses and industries that are not identical to those with which we have historically been successful 
if these investments or arrangements are not successful  our earnings could be materially adversely affected by increased expenses and decreased finance income 
if our technology and phone systems are not operational  our operations could be disrupted and our ability to successfully acquire receivable portfolios and receive collections from debtors could be adversely affected 
our success depends  in part  on sophisticated telecommunications and computer systems 
the temporary loss of our computer and telecommunications systems  through casualty  operating malfunction or service provider failure  could disrupt our operations 
in addition  we must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately to properly bid on prospective acquisitions of receivable portfolios and to access  maintain and expand the databases we use for our collection and monitoring activities 
any failure of our information systems and their backup systems would interrupt our operations 
we may not have adequate backup arrangements for all of our operations and we may incur significant losses if an outage occurs 
in addition  we rely on third party collection agencies and attorneys who also may be adversely affected in the event of an outage in which the third party collection agencies and attorneys do not have adequate backup arrangements 
any interruption in our operations or our third party collection agencies and attorneys operations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
however  the company is in the process of implementing a disaster recovery program which would mitigate this risk 
our organizational documents and delaware law may make it harder for us to be acquired without the consent and cooperation of our board of directors and management 
several provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt  including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price of our common stock 
under the terms of our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the stockholders  to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions thereof 
the ability to issue shares of preferred stock could tend to discourage takeover or acquisition proposals not supported by our current board of directors 
in addition  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires or more of our common stock 
future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of december  of these shares   are held by our affiliates and are saleable under rule of the securities act of  as amended 
the remainder of our outstanding shares is freely tradable 
in addition  options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock were outstanding as of september   of which  were vested 
in certain cases  the exercise prices of such options were higher than the current market price of our common stock 
we may also issue additional shares in connection with our business and may grant additional stock options or restricted shares to our employees  officers  directors and consultants under our present or future equity compensation plans or we may issue warrants to third parties outside of such plans 
as of september  there were  shares available for such purpose with such shares available under the equity compensation plan and the stock option plan 
no more options are available for issuance under the 
table of contents stock option plan 
if a significant portion of these shares were sold in the public market  the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected 
from time to time  the company s chairman emeritus  arthur stern and president and chief executive officer  gary stern have adopted prearranged stock trading plans in accordance with guidelines specified by rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
while no such plans are in effect at present  significant sales by the stern family could have an adverse effect on market price for our common stock 
the company purchased a portfolio in a south american country exposing the company to currency rate fluctuations 
as a result of this million purchase in fiscal year  the company is exposed to currency rate fluctuations as the collections on this portfolio are denominated in the local currency of the south american country 
additionally  our investment could also be exposed to the same currency risk 
a strengthened us dollar could decrease the us dollar equivalent of the local currency collections  and the local currency conversion to us dollars would suffer upon settlement of transactions associated with this investment with the parent company 
the company has no foreign currency hedge contracts in place 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and cause our stock price to decline 
because of the nature of our business  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our results may fluctuate as a result of any of the following the timing and amount of collections on our consumer receivable portfolios  our inability to identify and acquire additional consumer receivable portfolios  a decline in the estimated future value of our consumer receivable portfolio recoveries  increases in operating expenses associated with the growth of our operations  general and economic market conditions  and prices we are willing to pay for consumer receivable portfolios

cautions regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements typically are identified by use of terms such as may  will  should  plan  expect  anticipate  estimate  and similar words  although some forward looking statements are expressed differently 
forward looking statements represent our judgment regarding future events  but we can give no assurance that such judgments will prove to be correct 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements 
certain factors which could materially affect our results and our future performance are described above under item a risk factors and below under critical accounting policies in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements are inherently uncertain as they are based on current expectations and assumptions concerning future events and are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which are only predictions and speak only as of the date of this report

unless the context otherwise requires  the terms we  us the company  or our as used herein refer to asta funding  inc and our subsidiaries 
overview we are primarily engaged in the business of acquiring  managing for our own account  servicing and recovering on portfolios of consumer receivables 
these portfolios generally consist of one or more of the following types of consumer receivables charged off receivables accounts that have been written off by the originators and may have been previously serviced by collection agencies  semi performing receivables accounts where the debtor is making partial or irregular monthly payments  but the accounts may have been written off by the originators  and in limited circumstances  performing receivables accounts where the debtor is making regular monthly payments that may or may not have been delinquent in the past 
we acquire these consumer receivable portfolios at a significant discount to the amount actually owed by the borrowers 
we acquire these portfolios after a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the underlying receivables and calculate the purchase price so that our estimated cash flow offers us an adequate return on our investment after servicing expenses 
after purchasing a portfolio  we actively monitor its performance and review and adjust our collection and servicing strategies accordingly 
we purchase receivables from credit grantors and others through privately negotiated direct sales  brokered transactions and auctions in which sellers of receivables seek bids from several pre qualified debt purchasers 
we pursue new acquisitions of consumer receivable portfolios on an ongoing basis through our relationships with industry participants  financial institutions  collection agencies  investors and our financing sources  brokers who specialize in the sale of consumer receivable portfolios  and other sources 
critical accounting policies we account for our investments in consumer receivable portfolios  using either the interest method  or the cost recovery method 

table of contents as we believe our extensive liquidating experience in certain asset classes such as distressed credit card receivables  consumer loan receivables and mixed consumer receivables has matured  we use the interest method when we believe we can reasonably estimate the timing of the cash flows 
in those situations where we diversify our acquisitions into other asset classes in which we do not possess the same expertise or history  or we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the cash flows  we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting for those portfolios of receivables 
the company accounts for its investment in finance receivables using the interest method under the guidance of asc static pools of accounts are established 
these pools are aggregated based on certain common risk criteria 
each static pool is recorded at cost and is accounted for as a single unit for the recognition of income  principal payments and loss provision 
we currently consider for aggregation portfolios of accounts  purchased within the same fiscal quarter  that generally have the following characteristics same issuer originator same underlying credit quality similar geographic distribution of the accounts similar age of the receivable and same type of asset class credit cards  telecommunications  etc 
after determining that an investment will yield an adequate return on our acquisition cost after servicing fees  including court costs  which are expensed as incurred  we use a variety of qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the estimated cash flows 
as previously mentioned  included in our analysis for purchasing a portfolio of receivables and determining a reasonable estimate of collections and the timing thereof  the following variables are analyzed and factored into our original estimates the number of collection agencies previously attempting to collect the receivables in the portfolio  the average balance of the receivables  the age of the receivables as older receivables might be more difficult to collect or might be less cost effective  past history of performance of similar assets as we purchase portfolios of similar assets  we believe we have built significant history on how these receivables will liquidate and cash flow  number of months since charge off  payments made since charge off  the credit originator and their credit guidelines  the locations of the debtors as there are better states to attempt to collect in and ultimately we have better predictability of the liquidations and the expected cash flows 
conversely  there are also states where the liquidation rates are not as good and that is factored into our cash flow analysis  financial wherewithal of the seller  jobs or property of the debtors found within portfolios with our business model  this is of particular importance 
debtors with jobs or property are more likely to repay their obligation and conversely  debtors without jobs or property are less likely to repay their obligation  and the ability to obtain customer statements from the original issuer 
we will obtain and utilize as appropriate input including  but not limited to  monthly collection projections and liquidation rates  from our third party collection agencies and attorneys  as further evidentiary matter  to assist us in developing collection strategies and in modeling the expected cash flows for a given portfolio 

table of contents we acquire accounts that have experienced deterioration of credit quality between origination and the date of our acquisition of the accounts 
the amount paid for a portfolio of accounts reflects our determination that it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the portfolio of accounts contractual terms 
we consider the expected payments and estimate the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal  interest and other cash flows for each acquired portfolio coupled with expected cash flows from accounts available for sales 
the excess of this amount over the cost of the portfolio  representing the excess of the account s cash flows expected to be collected over the amount paid  is accreted into income recognized on finance receivables over the expected remaining life of the portfolio 
we believe we have significant experience in acquiring certain distressed consumer receivable portfolios at a significant discount to the amount actually owed by underlying debtors 
we acquire these portfolios only after both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the underlying receivables are performed and a calculated purchase price is paid so that we believe our estimated cash flow offers us an adequate return on our acquisition costs including servicing expenses 
additionally  when considering larger portfolio purchases of accounts  or portfolios from issuers from whom we have little or limited experience  we have the added benefit of soliciting our third party collection agencies and attorneys for their input on liquidation rates and at times incorporate such input into the price we offer for a given portfolio and the estimates we use for our expected cash flows 
as a result of the recent and current challenging economic environment and the impact it has had on collections  for portfolio purchases acquired in fiscal year we have extended our time frame of the expectation of recovering of our invested capital within a month period from an month period  and the expectation of recovering of invested capital to a period of years which is an increase from the previous year expectation 
we routinely monitor these expectations against the actual cash flows and  in the event the cash flows are below our expectations and we believe there are no reasons relating to mere timing differences or explainable delays such as can occur  particularly when the court system is involved for the reduced collections  an impairment would be recorded as a provision for credit losses 
conversely  in the event the cash flows are in excess of our expectations and the reason is due to timing  we would defer the excess collection as deferred revenue 
the company uses the cost recovery method when collections on a particular pool of accounts cannot be reasonably predicted 
under the cost recovery method  no income is recognized until the cost of the portfolio has been fully recovered 
a pool can become fully amortized zero carrying balance on the balance sheet while still generating cash collections 
in this case  all cash collections are recognized as revenue when received

table of contents year ended september  compared to the year ended september  finance income 
for the year ended september   finance income decreased million or to million from million for the year ended september  the average outstanding level of consumer receivable accounts acquired for liquidation decreased from million for the fiscal year ended september  to million for fiscal year ended september   reflecting a combination of lower collections and lower portfolio purchases in compared to the prior period 
a significant reason for the decrease in finance income is the impact of the portfolio purchase being transferred from the interest method to the cost recovery method effective in the third quarter of fiscal year the finance income recorded on the portfolio purchase in fiscal year  prior to the transfer to cost recovery  was million  as compared to zero finance income recorded in fiscal year no finance income will be recognized on the portfolio purchase until after the entire carrying value of million  as of september   is collected 
during the fiscal year ended september   we acquired consumer receivable portfolios at a cost of million as compared to million during the fiscal year ended september  the portfolios purchased in fiscal year include a portfolio purchased that is domiciled in south america at a cost of million 
further  as we have curtailed our purchases of new portfolios of consumer receivables during the second  third and fourth quarters of and into  finance income was negatively impacted and will continue to be negatively impacted going forward since we are not replacing our receivables acquired for liquidation 
instead  we are focusing  in the short term  on reducing our debt and being highly disciplined in our portfolio purchases 
we continue to review potential portfolio acquisitions regularly and will be buyers at the right price  where we believe the purchase will yield our desired rate of return 
finance income recognized from fully amortized portfolios zero basis revenue was million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
there were no accretable yield adjustments recorded during the fiscal years ended september  and other income 
other income of  and  for the fiscal year ended september  and  respectively  consisted primarily of service fee income and interest income from banks 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million from million for the year ended september  lower general and administrative expenses is due primarily to lower staffing levels as collections and purchase of accounts acquired for liquidation decreased significantly from the prior year 
staffing levels have decreased  from full time employees as of september  to full time employees as of september  approximately employees were eliminated in february as a result of the closing of the pennsylvania call center  with a salary cost savings of approximately million during the year ended september  lower postage expense in the current fiscal year is a reflection of fewer mailings resulting from lower portfolio purchases 
interest expense 
for the year ended september   interest expense decreased million or to million from million during the year ended september  the decrease was due to a decrease in our outstanding borrowings under our line of credit and our receivables financing agreement  during the year ended september   as compared to the outstanding borrowings during the year ended september   coupled with lower interest rates during the year ended september  the average interest rate excluding unused credit line fees for the year ended september  on the line of credit and the receivable financing agreement was as compared to during the year ended september  the rate on the subordinated debt related party is fixed at 
the average outstanding borrowings decreased from million to million for the years ended september  and  respectively  reflecting the company s continuing effort to pay down its debt 
impairments 
impairments of million were recorded by the company during the year ended september  as compared to million for the year ended september  included in the current year s impairments is approximately million related to the interest method portfolios and million related to cost recovery method portfolios  including applied to the portfolio purchase 
for the interest method portfolios  relative collections with respect to our expectations were deteriorating and this deterioration was 
table of contents confirmed by our third party collection agencies and attorneys 
the deterioration  which has impacted us throughout the year  became more significant during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended september  historically  moving through the year and into the fourth quarter  collections tend to be stable or perhaps increase in performance 
for cost recovery portfolios the impairments recorded wrote down the cost recovery portfolios to their net realizable value 
as with the interest method portfolios  our third party collection agencies and attorneys confirmed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the recent trend of the deterioration of collections 
although collections on the cost recovery method portfolios are expected to continue  we have determined the final estimated collections will not be enough to recover the original cost of or current carrying value of the portfolio 
the impairment charge for the portfolio purchase wrote down the value of the portfolio to million 
impairment charges in included million on the portfolio purchase prior to its transfer to the cost recovery method 
income tax benefit expense income tax benefit for fiscal year of million consists of a federal tax benefit of million and a state tax benefit of million 
the state deferred tax benefit is inclusive of a million valuation allowance 
although the carryforward period for state income tax purposes is up to twenty years  given the economic conditions  such economic environment could limit growth over a reasonable time period to realize the deferred tax asset 
the company determined the time period allowance for carryforward is outside a reasonable period to forecast full realization of the deferred tax asset  therefore recognized the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the company continually monitors forecast information to ensure the valuation allowance is at the appropriate value 
in fiscal year the income tax expense of million was comprised of a net federal tax of million including million current and a net state tax of million including million current 
the current year tax benefit is driven primarily by the impairment charges recorded during the fiscal year net loss income 
for the year ended september   net income decreased million to million from million for the year ended september   primarily reflecting increased impairments and reduced finance income in fiscal year  partially offset by lower income taxes and expenses 
net income per diluted share for the year ended september  decreased per diluted share to per diluted share  from per diluted share for the year ended september  year ended september  compared to the year ended september  finance income 
for the year ended september   finance income decreased million or to million from million for the year ended september  although the average outstanding level of consumer receivable accounts acquired for liquidation increased from million for the fiscal year ended september  to million for fiscal year ended september   the decrease in finance income resulted primarily from the portfolio purchase being transferred from the interest method to the cost recovery method effective in the third quarter of fiscal year the finance income recorded on the portfolio purchase during the fiscal year ended september  was approximately million which relates to our ownership of the portfolio purchase for only seven months during that period  as compared to million recorded in the first six months of fiscal year prior to the transfer to cost recovery 
as a result of the transfer to cost recovery  no finance income was recognized on the portfolio purchase during the second half of fiscal year and no further finance income will be recognized on the portfolio purchase after september  until the entire carrying value of million value as of september   is collected 
during the fiscal year ended september   we acquired consumer receivable portfolios at a cost of million as compared to million during the fiscal year ended september   which included the portfolio purchase at a cost of million 
the portfolios purchased in fiscal year include a portfolio purchase domiciled in south america at million 
further  as we have curtailed our purchases of new portfolios of consumer receivables during the second  third and fourth quarters of  we expect to see a reduction in finance income in future quarters and future years  since we are not replacing our receivables acquired for liquidation 
instead  we are focusing  in the short term  on reducing our debt and being highly disciplined in our portfolio purchases 
we continue to review potential portfolio acquisitions regularly and will be buyers at the right price  where we believe the purchase will yield our desired rate of return 
however  purchases in the first quarter of fiscal have remained at the reduced levels 
as the environment continues to be challenging  data received in the 
table of contents second quarter of fiscal year reflects a continued slowness of collections  in relation to our estimates 
as this data impacts the first quarter of fiscal year  impairments of approximately million are required in the first quarter of fiscal year there were no accretable yield adjustments recorded during the fiscal year ended september  adjustments to accretable yields on certain portfolios were recorded in the amount of million for the year ended september  finance income related to the accretable yield reclassifications during the year ended september  was approximately million 
income recognized from fully amortized portfolios zero based revenue was million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase is due primarily to more pools which were fully amortized in the fourth quarter of  and were predominantly derived from credit card purchases from one issuer made in and and telecommunications portfolios purchased from through collections with regard to the portfolio purchase were million for the fiscal year ended september  and million for the period owned through september   which includes approximately million collected from the seller for accounts returned to the seller 
other income 
other income of  for the fiscal year ended september  consisted primarily of service fee income and interest income from banks 
other income of million for the year ended september  includes interest income from banks and other loan instruments substantially acquired in  which were collected during the fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   general and administrative expenses increased million or to million from million for the year ended september   and represented of total expenses excluding income taxes for the year ended september  as compared to for the year ended september  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in receivable servicing expenses during the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september  the increase in receivable servicing expenses resulted from the increase in our average number of accounts acquired for liquidation  primarily due to the portfolio purchase in the second quarter of a majority of the increased costs were from collection related expenses  consulting and skiptracing fees further described below  salaries  payroll taxes and benefits  professional fees  telephone charges and travel costs  as we are visiting our third party collection agencies and attorneys on a more frequent basis for financial and operational audits 
in december  the company negotiated an agreement with a third party servicer  to assist the company in the asset location  skiptracing efforts and ultimately the suing of debtors with respect to the portfolio purchase 
the agreement calls for a percent fee on substantially all gross collections from the portfolio purchase on the first million and on substantially all collections from the portfolio purchase in excess of million 
the fee was agreed to in december of and retroactive to march and we believe this arrangement enhances our collection efforts 
the fee is applied to collections on the portfolio purchase and is not included in general and administrative expenses 
additionally  the company is paying this third party servicer a monthly fee of  per month for months for its consulting and skiptracing efforts in connection with the portfolio purchase 
the  fee is included in general and administrative expenses 
this fee began in may during the fiscal year ended september   million was recorded as collection expense as compared to million in fiscal year interest expense 
for the year ended september   interest expense decreased  to million from million during the year ended september   and represented of total expenses excluding income taxes for the year ended september  as compared to for the year ended september  the decrease was due to a decrease in our outstanding borrowings under our line of credit and our receivables financing agreement  slightly offset by the increase in the subordinated debt from a related party  during the year ended september   as compared to the outstanding borrowings during the year ended september   coupled with lower interest rates during the year ended september  the average interest rate excluding unused credit line fees for the year ended september  on the line of credit and the receivable financing agreement was as compared to during the year ended september  the rate on the subordinated debt related party is fixed at 
although outstanding borrowings decreased approximately million during the fiscal year ended september   the average outstanding borrowings increased from million to million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase was caused by the higher levels of borrowing stemming from the portfolio purchase in the second 
table of contents quarter of since then  the company has been limiting portfolio purchases and concentrating on paying down debt 
impairments 
impairments of million were recorded by the company during the year ended september  as compared to million for the year ended september   and represented of total expenses excluding income taxes for the year ended september   as compared to for the year ended september  because relative collections with respect to our expectations on these portfolios were deteriorating  and this deterioration was confirmed by our third party collection agencies and attorneys  we believed that impairment charges became necessary 
equity in earnings of venture 
in august  the company invested approximately million for a interest in a newly formed venture 
the venture invested in a bankruptcy liquidation that collects on existing rental contracts and the liquidation of inventory 
the company s share of the income was  and  during the years ended september  and  respectively 
the company has received approximately million in cash distributions from the inception of the venture through september  net income 
for the year ended september   net income decreased million  or to million from million for the year ended september   primarily reflecting the increased impairments recorded in fiscal year and the reduced finance income from the portfolio purchase for the last six months of due to the switch from the interest method to the cost recovery method 
net income per share for the year ended september  decreased per diluted share  or to per diluted share  from per diluted share for the year ended september  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash from operations include collections on the receivable portfolios that we have acquired 
our primary uses of cash include repayment of debt  our purchases of consumer receivable portfolios  interest payments  costs involved in the collections of consumer receivables  taxes and dividends  if approved 
in the past we relied significantly upon our lenders to provide the funds necessary for the purchase of consumer and accounts receivable portfolios 
as of september   the eighth amendment to the credit facility entered into on july   granted an initial million line of credit from the bank group for portfolio purchases and working capital and was scheduled to reduce to zero by december  the credit facility bore an interest at the lesser of libor plus an applicable margin  or the prime rate minus an applicable margin based on certain leverage ratios  with a minimum rate of 
the credit facility was collateralized by all assets of the company other than the assets of palisades xvi and contained financial and other covenants relative to tangible net worth  interest coverage  and leverage ratio  as defined that must be maintained in order to borrow funds

this credit facility was repaid on december  as the loan was repaid there were no covenant requirements on the credit facility 
on december  asta funding  inc and its subsidiaries other than palisades xvi  entered into a new revolving credit agreement with bank leumi  which permits maximum principal advances of up to million

in addition  other collateral for the loan consists of a pledge by gms family investors  llc  an investment company owned by members of the stern family in the form of cash and securities with a value of of the loan commitment 
on december  approximately million of the bank leumi credit line was drawn and used to pay off in full the remaining balance on the credit facility the company formerly had with the bank group with idb as agent 
in march  palisades xvi consummated the portfolio purchase 
the portfolio purchase is made up of predominantly credit card accounts and includes accounts in collection litigation and accounts as to which the sellers have been awarded judgments and other traditional charge offs 
the company s line of credit with the bank group was fully utilized  as modified in february  with the aggregate deposit of million paid for the portfolio purchase 
the remaining million was paid on march  by borrowing approximately million inclusive of transaction costs under a new receivables financing agreement entered into by palisades xvi with a major 
table of contents financial institution as the funding source  and consists of debt with full recourse only to palisades xvi  and  as of june   bore an interest rate of approximately basis points over libor 
the term of the original agreement was three years 
all proceeds received as a result of the net collections from the portfolio purchase are applied to interest and principal of the underlying loan 
the company made certain representations and warranties to the lender to support the transaction 
the portfolio purchase is serviced by palisades collection  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  which has also engaged several unrelated subservicers 
on february   the company entered into the fourth amendment receivables financing agreement 
the effect of this fourth amendment is  among other things  to i lower the collection rate minimum to million per month plus interest and fees as an average for each period of three consecutive months  ii provide for an automatic extension of the maturity date from april  to april  should the outstanding balance be reduced to million or less by april  and iii permanently waive the previous termination events 
the interest rate remained unchanged at approximately basis points over libor  subject to automatic reduction in the future should certain collection milestones be attained 
as additional credit support for repayment by palisades xvi of its obligations under the receivables financing agreement and as an inducement for bmo to enter into the fourth amendment  the company provided bmo a limited recourse  subordinated guaranty  secured by the assets of the company  in an amount not to exceed million plus reasonable costs of enforcement and collection 
under the terms of the guaranty  bmo cannot exercise any recourse against the company until the earlier of i five years from the date of the fourth amendment and ii the termination of the company s existing senior lending facility or any successor senior facility 
the aggregate minimum repayment obligations required under the fourth amendment to the receivables financing agreement entered into on february  with palisades xvi including interest and principal for fiscal years ending september  and september  seven months  are million and million  respectively  plus monthly interest and fees 
there is an additional requirement that the balance of the facility be reduced to million by april  while the company believes it will be able to make all payments due under the new payment schedule  it is likely we will not be able to reduce the balance of the facility to million by april   and there is no assurance the loan will be extended 
we anticipate working with bmo to extend the facility by the expiration date 
on september  and  the outstanding balance on the receivable financing agreement loan was approximately million  and million  respectively 
the average interest rate of the receivable financing agreement was and for the fiscal year ended september  and  respectively 
on april   the company obtained a subordinated loan pursuant to a subordinated promissory note from the family entity 
the family entity is a greater than shareholder of the company beneficially owned and controlled by arthur stern  the chairman emeritus of the company  gary stern  the president  chairman and chief executive officer of the company  and members of their families 
the loan is in the aggregate principal amount of  bears interest at a rate of per annum  is payable interest only each quarter until its maturity date of january   subject to prior repayment in full of the company s senior loan facility with a consortium of banks 
interest expense on this loan was  for the year ended september  the family entity loan has been extended until december  with a new interest rate subsequent to january  of per annum 
the subordinated loan was incurred by the company to resolve certain issues with a significant servicer 
proceeds of the subordinated loan were used to reduce the balance due on our line of credit with the bank group on june  this facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries  other than the assets of palisades xvi  which was separately financed by bmo 
as of september   our cash decreased million to million from million at september   including an  positive effect of foreign exchange on cash 
the decrease in cash during the fiscal year ended september   was due to a decrease in net income for the period  partially offset by an increase in cash flows from investing and financing activities 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities was million during the fiscal year ended september   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the fiscal year ended september  the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities virtually mirrors the change in net income adjusted for non cash items 
net cash provided by investing activities was million during the fiscal year ended september   as compared to net cash used by investing activities of million during the fiscal year ended september  the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the decrease in the purchase of accounts acquired for liquidation during the fiscal year ended september   partially offset by a decrease in collections during the same period 
net cash used in financing activities was million during the fiscal year ended september   as compared to cash used in financing activities of million in the prior period 
the change in net cash used by financing activities was primarily due to a smaller pay down of debt during the fiscal year ended september  compared to that in the prior period 
our cash requirements have been and will continue to be significant and we have depended on external financing to acquire consumer receivables and operate the business 
significant requirements include repayments under our debt facilities  purchase of consumer receivable portfolios  interest payments  costs involved in the collections of consumer receivables  and taxes 
in addition  dividends are paid if approved by the board of directors 
acquisitions have been financed primarily through cash flows from operating activities and a credit facility 
we believe we will be less dependent on a credit facility in the short term as our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to purchase portfolios and operate the business 
however  as the collection environment remains challenging  we may seek additional funding 
our business model affords us the ability to sell accounts on an opportunistic basis 
while we have not consummated any significant sales from our portfolio purchase  we launched a sales effort in order to attempt to enhance our cash flow and pay down our debt faster 
the results are slower than expected for a variety of factors  including a slow resale market  similar to the decrease in pricing we are seeing in general
