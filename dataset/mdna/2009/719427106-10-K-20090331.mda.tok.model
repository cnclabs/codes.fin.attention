risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
company overview we specialize in developing and marketing innovative  premium priced products for the mass market channel 
our products focus on addressing skin imperfections through a problem solution approach  unlike competitors whose products focus primarily on changing fashion trends 
our products address specific  everyday cosmetics needs and include face powders  bronzers  concealers  blushes  foundations  eye shadows  eye liners  brow makeup and mascaras 
we sell our products to mass market retailers such as wal mart  walgreens  cvs  target and rite aid 
our products provide above average profitability for retailers due to their higher price points and sales per linear foot 
our products are currently sold in approximately  of the  stores in which we estimate our masstige competitors products are sold 
we seek to be first to market with new products within this channel  and are able to take new products from concept development to shipment in less than months 
new products are a very important part of our business and have contributed  on average  approximately of our net sales for the last three years 
we have achieved significant growth over the last three years  driven largely by the yearly introduction of new products  the popularity of our innovative problem solution products and our ability to significantly expand the breadth and depth of our distribution network 
we have grown net sales to million in from million in  representing a compounded annual growth rate of 
factors affecting our operating results our net sales are impacted by advertising  discounts and promotions  merchandising  packaging  the availability of wall display space at our retailer customers  inventory management at retailers and the timing of new product launches and line extensions  all of which have a significant impact on consumers buying decisions 
continued growth of our net sales and profitability will depend substantially on the continued popularity of our new and existing products  our ability to effectively manage our sales and distribution networks and our ability to maintain sufficient product supply to meet expected growth in demand 
in the three months ended december   the consumer environment weakened and tight retailer inventory controls reduced the size of orders for new products 
we expect to sell a higher percentage of our products to retailer customers that require larger discounts and trade allowances  which would negatively impact our net sales and gross margin 
in  we experienced an unusually high level of returns due in part to weakening consumer demand for higher priced promotional kits  which had a negative impact on our net sales 
in the first quarter of  one of our largest retailer customers informed us that as a result of a change in its strategy  the customer intends to reduce the space allocated to the entire color cosmetics category in its stores in  which will most likely affect all brands in the category 
this change will have a negative impact on our net sales and results of operations  and could result in a complete loss of our distribution to the customer in this customer accounted for of our gross sales in our cost of sales includes our costs to manufacture products in our own facilities  including raw material and labor costs and all overhead expenses related to production and quality control  as well as the cost to purchase components  such as plastic compact containers or plastic tubes  and semi finished goods  such as plastic compact containers or plastic tubes filled with product  from third party manufacturers and inbound freight 
we primarily purchase plastic component parts from manufacturers in china  rather than purchasing them through brokers 
on january   the california minimum wage increased to per hour 
the automation of an assembly line and our use of components and semi finished goods as well as our own manufacturing facilities have allowed us to maintain significant production flexibility 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include all warehouse and outbound freight expenses  selling  marketing  research and development costs  finance  information technology  depreciation  amortization of intangibles  professional fees  non cash charges for stock based compensation for certain employees and administrative and distribution facility expenses 
our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment during the second quarter of each fiscal year and when events or circumstances occur that potentially indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable 
given that the continued downturn in the us economy during the fourth quarter of significantly lowered consumer discretionary spending  which lowered the demand for our products  along with the continued deterioration of our market capitalization  we tested goodwill and other intangible assets as of december  for impairment 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of goodwill and trade names by million and million  respectively  as of december  this does not impact our overall business operations 
factors affecting comparability seasonality our business  similar to others in the cosmetic industry  is subject to seasonal variation due to the annual sell in period when retailers decide how much retail space will be allotted to each supplier and the number of new and existing products to be offered in their stores 
for us  this period has historically been from december through april 
sales during these months are typically greater due to the shipments required to fill the inventory at retail stores and retailers warehouses 
retailers typically reset their retail selling space during these months to accommodate changes in space allocation to each supplier and to incorporate the addition of new products and the deletion of slow selling items 
our net sales for the three months ended december  were higher than our net sales for the three months ended september   as a result of this seasonality 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of reasons including the timing of new product introductions  general economic conditions or consumer buyer behavior 
in addition  results for any one quarter may not be indicative of results for the same quarter in subsequent years 
three months ended march june september december net sales income loss from operations net income loss net sales income loss from operations net income loss net sales income loss from operations net income loss effects of the public offering and related transactions in connection with the initial public offering in november  we repaid amounts outstanding under our old senior credit agreement and repurchased our senior subordinated notes and replaced our old senior credit agreement with a new senior credit agreement  which reduced our interest expense in the three months ended december  the refinancing also resulted in a non cash charge to interest expense for the unamortized portion of the capitalized fees and expenses related to the old senior credit agreement and the senior subordinated notes of approximately million and a small loss related to our termination of the associated interest rate collar 
we amended the performance vesting options held by our senior management and certain employees to accelerate vesting of  performance vesting options upon the completion of the initial public offering 
the performance vesting options that did not vest and become exercisable upon completion of the initial public offering vested and became exercisable in equal installments over a period of two years from the date of the closing of the initial public offering 
the vesting resulted in a non cash charge of approximately million in the three months ended december  the amendment of the options also increased the number of our fully diluted shares outstanding by an amount that depends on the trading price of our common stock  and thus reduced our earnings per fully diluted share 
in addition  we paid a  cash bonus to our chief financial officer and  in cash bonuses to certain senior financial personnel upon completion of the initial public offering 
on april   the company completed a secondary public offering in which certain stockholders sold  shares of the company s common stock  which included  shares of common stock sold pursuant to the underwriters over allotment option 
the company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares but incurred approximately  of expenses related to the offering  including a  cash bonus to our chief financial officer upon completion of the secondary public offering 
results of operations the table below sets forth certain operating data expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill and intangible asset impairment loss income from operations interest expense net other expense income loss income before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net loss income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was primarily attributable to a change in product mix as the volume of higher priced products increased when compared to a year ago and a decrease in our provision for coupon programs of million 
the variance in our provision for coupon programs is primarily due to a decrease in historical redemption rates when compared to prior year 
offsetting our net sales growth in was a decrease in total unit volume and increases in our provision for returns and cooperative advertising programs 
total unit volume decreased by million units  or  to million units in from million units in due to tighter retailer inventory controls in the fourth quarter of new products represented of our net sales in compared to in our provision for returns increased million when compared to the prior year due to higher returns from our retailers due primarily to lower than anticipated retail sell through of higher priced promotional kits and retailer customers wall display changes 
the provision for cooperative advertising programs increased by million when compared to prior year due to management s strategic decision to increase cooperative advertising programs to increase consumer retail sales 
during  our results included net sales of million from our international customers  compared to million for  due to a broader distribution in the canadian market 
cost of sales cost of sales increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in cost of sales resulted primarily from an increase in product cost of million and an increase in the write down of obsolete and slow moving inventory of million 
the variance in product costs is due to a change in product mix as volume of higher cost products increased when compared to a year ago 
the increase was offset by an increase in inventory recovery inventory returned by customers deemed to be resaleable of million due to higher returns from our retailers 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in the increase in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was primarily due to an increase in our provision for returns from retailers offset by an increase in inventory recovery 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in the variance was primarily due to a million increase in marketing spending  a million increase in costs  and a million increase in freight and warehouse costs  a million increase in realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange losses  a million increase in distribution costs  a million increase in corporate administrative costs  a million increase in provision for bad debts and a million increase in expense for stock option awards 
the increase in the above costs was offset by a million decrease in transaction fees that were associated with the secondary public offering in and a million decrease in professional fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge of million for the impairment of goodwill and trade names  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in the second quarter of each fiscal year and when events or circumstances occur that potentially indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable 
given the continued significant downturn in the us economy during the fourth quarter of  which significantly lowered consumer discretionary spending  which lowered the demand for our products  along with the continued deterioration of our market capitalization  we tested goodwill and other intangible assets as of december  for impairment 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge at december  of million to write off the entire amount of our previously recorded goodwill 
additionally  we recorded a non cash impairment charge at december  of million to write down the carrying value of our trade names to their fair value 
these non cash impairment charges do not impact our overall business operations 
we determined that the carrying value of our definite lived intangible assets were not impaired as of december  interest expense net interest expense decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the decrease in interest expense was due to the decrease in average borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and a decline in our weighted average interest rates of basis points for when compared to other expense income other expense income increased million to an expense of million in  from income of million in  which consisted primarily of realized and unrealized losses related to investments held as part of our non qualified deferred compensation plans 
benefit provision for income taxes the benefit provision for income taxes represents federal  state and local income taxes 
in  the benefit for income taxes was million  representing an effective income tax rate of  compared to income tax expense of million in  representing an effective tax rate of 
in  the effective rate differed from statutory rates primarily due to the permanent differences related to the goodwill impairment charge 
other factors impacting the effective rate were our change in filing position in various state tax jurisdictions and fluctuations in permanent differences between book and taxable income such as charitable contributions and research and development credits 
in  the effective rate differed from statutory rates due to the effect of varying state and local taxes and certain permanent items such as charitable contributions  tax benefit deficiencies on stock options exercised and research and development credits 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was primarily attributable to growth in sales of our face makeup products  as we continued to broaden our total distribution 
total distribution represents the number of stores in which we sell products multiplied by our number of stock keeping units per store 
unit sales for our face makeup increased by million units  or  to million units in from million units in new products represented of our net sales in compared to in partially offsetting our net sales growth in was a decrease in sales of our eye makeup products 
unit sales for our eye makeup decreased by million units  or  to million units in from million in trade spending with retailers increased by million  which includes an increase in cooperative advertising expense of million  an increase in our provision for markdowns of million  an increase in our provision for returns of million  an increase in our provision for cash discounts of million and an increase in our provision for coupon expense of million 
the variance is primarily due to management s strategic decision to increase trade spending with retailers for in store advertising and promotions to increase consumer retail sales 
during  our results included net sales of million from our international customers  compared to million for cost of sales cost of sales increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in cost of sales resulted primarily from an increase in volume in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in the increase in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was primarily due to an increase in the write down of obsolete and slow moving inventory of million offset by a slight decrease in the recovery of inventory returns of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent at million in and the slight variance was primarily due to a million increase in marketing spending and a million increase in fixed costs that included a million increase in employee compensation associated with our growth  a million expense for transaction fees associated with the secondary public offering  a million increase in distribution costs related to our growth  a million increase in depreciation expense  as well as an increase in accounting and other expenses associated with being a public company 
in addition  there were higher costs associated with increased sales volumes  including a million increase in outbound freight costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was offset by a decrease of million for our stock options awards due to a charge of million associated with the acceleration of vesting of certain performance vesting options in connection with our initial public offering 
interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was due to the decrease in average borrowings outstanding under our credit facility as we repaid all borrowings under our former senior credit agreement with the proceeds of the initial public offering 
other income other income increased  or  to  in  from  in  which consisted primarily of realized and unrealized gains related to investments held as part of our non qualified deferred compensation plans 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  state and local income taxes

liquidity and capital resources cash flows as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents compared to no cash and cash equivalents as of december  the level of cash reflects an increase in net cash provided by operating activities 
as of december   we had million of availability under the revolving credit facility 
the significant components of our working capital are accounts receivable and inventories  reduced by accounts payable  accrued expenses  line of credit borrowings and the current portion of our long term debt 
net working capital decreased to million at december  when compared to million at december  although working capital requirements typically increase during the fourth quarter of  when we experience higher inventory levels as we produce new products for shipment in the first quarter of the following year  the decrease in working capital at december  is primarily due to the classification of the entire outstanding term loan borrowing of million as of december   as a current liability 
during march  we entered into an amendment of our senior credit agreement  whereby the outstanding term loan was replaced with borrowings under the revolving credit facility that is classified as current and expires in march accordingly  the term loans outstanding at december  of million have been classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet at december  we have budgeted capital expenditures of million for for several key projects  including investments in retail permanent fixtures classified as other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  investment in our information technology infrastructure and improvements to our manufacturing and distribution equipment 
we expect capital requirements related to investments in retail permanent fixtures to total million from to  of which million was incurred as of december  capital requirements related to manufacturing include an upgrade to a major project undertaken in to automate a product assembly line that is used to assemble products that represented approximately of our total sales in we expect the aggregate capital requirements of this project to total million  of which million was incurred as of december  in addition to an estimated million related to the investments in retail permanent fixtures and million required to upgrade the assembly line project  we expect to make improvements to other manufacturing and distribution equipment at a cost of approximately million  improvements to our information technology infrastructure at a cost of approximately million and improvements to our research and development equipment of approximately million in in  our capital expenditures totaled approximately million  which was in line with our revised budget  which included investments in retail permanent fixtures 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities increased million  or  to million in  from million in the net increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital and higher non cash activities impacting net loss income 
in  the net loss of million was offset by net non cash charges of million including goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of million and a net decrease in working capital needs of million 
in  net income of million and net non cash charges of million were partially offset by a net increase in working capital needs of million 
cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or  to million in  from million for in the net decrease in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from increases in working capital needs and lower non cash charges impacting net income

the senior credit agreement was amended on july   september   december  and march   as described below 
at december   there was million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at an interest rate of and we had million of availability under the revolving credit facility 
there were no outstanding letters of credit as of december  the interest rate on the term loan was at december  the availability under the revolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
amounts outstanding under the term loan facility totaled million at december  the term loan facility was replaced with borrowings under the revolving credit facility on march  in connection with the fourth amendment as described below 
borrowings under the senior credit agreement are guaranteed by physicians formula holdings  inc and the domestic subsidiaries of physicians formula  inc  and borrowings under the senior credit agreement are secured by a pledge of the capital stock of physicians formula  inc and its equity interests in each of its subsidiaries and substantially all of the assets of physicians formula  inc and its subsidiaries 
on july   we entered into the first amendment to our senior credit agreement  which reduced the applicable interest rates on borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facilities by to a libor adjusted rate as defined in the senior credit agreement plus or a base rate as defined in the senior credit agreement plus 
on september   we entered into the second amendment to our senior credit agreement  which permitted physicians formula  inc to directly purchase shares of our common stock or to make cash distributions to us to allow us to repurchase shares of our common stock in an amount not to exceed million in the aggregate 
on december   we entered into the third amendment to our senior credit agreement  which increased the size of the revolving credit facility to million 
the third amendment also included an amendment to the total leverage ratio covenant to provide us with increased flexibility in  an amendment to the minimum tangible net worth covenant so that a one time increase in the minimum tangible net worth requirement that was originally scheduled to occur on january  would instead occur in five steps over five consecutive quarters starting on january   and an amendment that provided that any time we make a repurchase of our common stock  we must have a minimum of million of availability under the revolving credit facility after giving effect to the repurchase 
on march   we entered into a fourth amendment to the senior credit agreement the fourth amendment to  among other things  eliminate the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and the maximum total leverage ratio covenants and replace them with a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum ebitda as defined in the senior credit agreement covenant and amend the minimum tangible net worth covenant  to give us relief under the financial maintenance covenants in in addition  the fourth amendment converted the entire facility  which previously consisted of an amortizing term loan and a revolving credit facility  into an asset based revolving credit facility  and the outstanding term loan was replaced with borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
availability under the revolving credit facility is now subject to the borrowing base formula described below 
the fourth amendment made certain other changes to the senior credit agreement  including a reduction in overall availability under the senior credit agreement  an increase in the applicable margin on interest rates for borrowings and a shortening of the term of the senior credit agreement to march  pursuant to the fourth amendment  the maximum amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility is equal to the lesser of i million and ii the sum of a up to of the book value of our eligible accounts receivable  b the lesser of up to of our eligible inventory with a permanent reduction to of eligible inventory after june  and million with a permanent reduction to million after june   c the balance of certain foreign currency accounts denominated in canadian dollars the canadian pledged accounts  and d the orderly liquidation value of eligible equipment not to exceed million  all as determined in accordance with the fourth amendment 
on june   the maximum availability for borrowing under the revolving credit facility will be permanently reduced to million 
the revolving credit facility will mature on march  in addition  the fourth amendment increased the applicable interest rate to a percentage equal to the lender s reference rate plus with a reduction to after june   eliminated the option to elect an interest rate based on libor and increased the commitment fee on unused commitments to all revenue received by us in canadian dollars is required to be deposited into the canadian pledged accounts  which are pledged to the agent to secure borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
we may use the balance in the canadian pledged accounts to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility  or  if we demonstrate availability under the borrowing base of at least million and other conditions are met  we may make monthly transfers from the canadian pledged account to a canadian disbursement account in an amount that will not cause the balance of the canadian disbursement account to exceed cdn  and  if other conditions are met  we may use the canadian disbursement account to pay amounts due to canadian vendors in the ordinary course of business 
the fourth amendment changed certain restrictive covenants in the senior credit agreement  including a reduction in permitted capital expenditures to not more than million per year and a general prohibition on the ability of physicians formula  inc to pay dividends to us  subject to a limited exception for certain expenses 
pursuant to the fourth amendment  physicians formula  inc is no longer permitted to purchase shares of our common stock or to make cash distributions to us to allow us to repurchase shares of our common stock 
the senior credit agreement contains certain additional negative covenants  including limitations on our ability to incur other indebtedness and liens  fundamentally change in our business through a merger  consolidation  amalgamation or liquidation  sell assets  make restricted payments  pay cash dividends from physicians formula  inc or pay for expenses of physicians formula holdings  inc  unless certain conditions are satisfied  make certain acquisitions  investments  loans and advances  engage in transactions with our affiliates  enter into certain agreements  engage in sale leaseback transactions  incur certain unfunded liabilities  and change our line of business 
the senior credit agreement requires us to make mandatory prepayments with the proceeds of certain asset dispositions and upon the receipt of insurance or condemnation proceeds to the extent we do not use the proceeds for the purchase of satisfactory replacement assets 
our senior credit agreement requires us to comply with financial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants in the senior credit agreement 
if we had not obtained the fourth amendment  we would not have been in compliance with the maximum total leverage ratio and the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirements on march  we are operating in a challenging economic environment  and our ability to comply with the new financial covenants in the senior credit agreement may be affected by future economic or business conditions beyond our control 
a failure to maintain the financial ratios in our senior credit agreement  if we are not able to obtain an amendment or waiver in the future  would be an event of default under our senior credit agreement 
if there is an event of default under our senior credit agreement  we would be precluded from borrowing under our revolving credit facility  and the indebtedness under our senior credit agreement could be declared immediately due and payable  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and liquidity 
there is no assurance that we would receive waivers should we not meet our financial covenant requirements 
even if we are able to obtain a waiver  in connection with negotiating a waiver we may be required to agree to other changes in the senior credit agreement including increased interest rates  tighter covenants or lower availability thresholds or pay a fee for such waiver 
if we are not able to comply with the new financial covenants in the senior credit agreement and we are unable to obtain waivers  we would need to obtain additional sources of liquidity  however  given the unprecedented instability in worldwide credit markets  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional sources of liquidity on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will provide adequate funds for our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case our revolving credit facility will mature in march our ability to extend the senior credit agreement after maturity  or to repay or refinance borrowings under the senior credit agreement  will depend on  among other things  our financial condition at the time and the availability of financing 
we may not be able to repay borrowings under the senior credit agreement when they become due 
given the unprecedented instability in worldwide credit markets  there can be no assurance that we will be able to extend the senior credit agreement  or if we are unable to do so  to obtain other financing necessary to operate our business 
further  any extension of the senior credit agreement or other financing may only be available on terms that are less favorable to us  and could cause an increase in our interest expense and decrease the amount of cash available for operations and investments in our business 
our inability to extend the senior credit agreement or refinance our borrowings would materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and liquidity 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december payments due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in thousands revolving credit facility current portion of long term debt obligations interest payments on long term debt obligations operating lease obligations other long term liabilities total on march   we entered into the fourth amendment and the outstanding term loan was replaced with borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
as such  the company has included the million of oustanding term loans as of december  in the current portion of long term debt 
for variable interest rate debt  the amounts included were calculated using  the rate that was in effect as of march  under the terms of the fourth amendment to the senior credit agreement 
other long term liabilities consist solely of deferred compensation and exclude obligations for uncertain tax positions of  as the timing of payment cannot be reasonably estimated 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts that rely on estimation techniques to calculate fair value 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure as of the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  returns  trade allowances  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  share based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results or changes in the estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain that are included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible assets  share based compensation and income taxes to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived principally from direct sales to retailers and wholesalers 
our standard arrangement for our customers includes a valid purchase order or contract with no customer acceptance provisions 
we recognize revenues from sales of products when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  products are shipped and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is reasonably assured 
sales are reported on a net sales basis  which is computed by deducting from gross sales a reserve for product returns  which includes actual returns to date and an amount established for anticipated product returns  as well as trade allowances 
our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested  authorized and approved 
in accepting returns  we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer 
allowances for estimated returns are provided for when the related revenue is recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
in the past  returns provisions have been adjusted higher or lower during the course of a fiscal year depending on actual results to date and anticipated returns for the remainder of a year 
experience has shown a relationship between gross sales and sales returns in the subsequent period  as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business 
in addition  as necessary  specific accruals may be established for known or anticipated events that we have considered  and will continue to consider  including the solvency of our customers  store closings by retailers  changes in the retail environment and decisions to continue to support new and existing products 
actual returns in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual returns exceed reserves  we would need to reduce our revenues at the time of such determination 
we have not experienced any material differences between the allowances for estimated returns and actual returns 
we offer trade allowances such as rebates  price protection  coupons and other incentives to customers in the normal course of business 
accruals for these allowances are provided for based on estimates and historical experience and are recorded as a reduction of net sales when the related revenue is recorded 
we have not experienced any material differences between the trade allowance accruals and actual trade allowances 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
we make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
slow moving and obsolete inventories are identified based on historical trends  sales projections and future known or anticipated events  including planned discontinuance of products 
when inventory is identified as slow moving or obsolete  we record an inventory write down equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
estimated market value is determined based on the amounts we expect to recover from third parties  including our arrangement with a third party liquidator 
this write down is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
we have not experienced any material differences between write downs and actual results 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value assigned to the net tangible and specific intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually as of june  or whenever events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests 
to apply sfas no 
 a company is divided into separate reporting units  each representing groups of activities that are separately managed 
for this purpose  we have one reporting unit 
in addition to the annual impairment test  the company assesses whether events or circumstances occurred that potentially indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of goodwill is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis  corroborated by a comparative market approach based on recent share prices and includes a control premium based on recent transactions that have occurred in the company s industry 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations  weighted average cost of capital wacc and terminal value assumptions 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry 
the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the impairment test involves preparing an allocation of the fair value of the company s reporting unit to the tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
given that the continued downturn in the us economy during the fourth quarter of significantly lowered consumer discretionary spending  which lowered the demand for our products  along with the continued deterioration of the company s market capitalization  we tested goodwill and other intangible assets as of december  for impairment 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million representing the entire amount of our previously recorded goodwill 
other indefinite lived intangible assets consist exclusively of trade names 
the physicians formula trade name has been used since and is a recognized brand within the cosmetics industry 
it is management s intent to leverage the trade names indefinitely into the future 
trade names are tested for impairment annually as of june  or whenever events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests 
we determined the fair value of the trade names by performing a projected discounted cash flow analysis based on the relief from royalty approach 
as a result of the conditions identified above  we conducted our most recent impairment test as of december   which resulted in a million non cash impairment charge to write down the carrying value of the trade names to their fair value 
we will not be required to make any current or future cash expenditures as a result of these impairments  and these impairments did not impact our financial covenant compliance under our senior credit agreement or our ongoing financial performance 
other intangible assets consist primarily of patents and distributor relationships 
patents and distributor relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives of and years  respectively 
intangible assets related to patents and distributor relationships are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
management estimated the useful life of the patents on the base technology that has been in existence for many years and is expected to continue through the estimated useful life and the useful life of the distributor relationships is based on historical attrition 
the carrying value of other definite lived intangible assets was tested and determined to not be impaired as of december  share based compensation on january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r using the prospective method 
under the prospective method  those nonpublic companies that previously used the minimum value method of measuring equity share options and similar instruments for either recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes apply sfas no 
r prospectively to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after january  under sfas no 
r  share based payments awards result in a cost that will be measured at fair value on the awards grant date  based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest 
compensation cost for awards that vest would not be reversed if the awards expire without being exercised 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider several factors when estimating expected forfeitures  such as types of awards 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
expected volatility of the stock will be based on companies of similar growth and maturity and our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data for our own stock 
the expected life of options granted represents management s best estimate based upon historical and expected trends in the company s stock option activity 
in the future  as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options  expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and  ultimately  the expense we record 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statements and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
on january   which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements  and did not record any cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as a result of adopting fin no 
interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense 
as of december   we have current net deferred income tax assets of million and non current net deferred income tax liabilities of million 
future earnings are expected to be sufficient for the realization of our deferred income tax assets 
if future earnings are less than expected  then a valuation allowance may be recorded to the extent  that on a statutory basis  net deferred assets are not offset by net deferred tax liabilities 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
r business combinations sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r expands the definition of a business  thus increasing the number of transactions that will qualify as business combinations 
sfas no 
r requires the acquirer to recognize percent of an acquired business s assets and liabilities  including goodwill and certain contingent assets and liabilities  at their fair values at the acquisition date 
contingent consideration is to be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until settled 
likewise  changes in acquired tax contingencies  including those existing at the date of adoption  are to be recognized in earnings if outside the maximum allocation period generally one year 
transaction related expenses and restructuring costs are to be expensed as incurred  and any adjustments to finalize the purchase accounting allocations  even within the allocation period  are to be shown as revised in the future consolidated financial statements to reflect the adjustments as if they had been recorded on the acquisition date 
finally  a gain could result in the event of a bargain purchase acquisition of a business below the fair market value of the assets and liabilities  or a gain or loss in the case of a change in the control of an existing investment 
sfas no 
r will be applied prospectively to business combinations with acquisition dates on or after january  adoption of sfas no 
r is not expected to materially impact the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations when it becomes effective in in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp 
fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
this change is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas no 
r and other accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
fsp is effective for the company at the beginning of fiscal year the requirement for determining useful lives must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date and the disclosure requirements must be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of  and subsequent to  the effective date 
adoption of fsp is not expected to materially impact the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations directly when it becomes effective in  as the only impact that fsp is expected to have relates to intangible assets acquired subsequent to january  that are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters as discussed under item business  we have environmental liabilities at our city of industry facilities 
these involve both onsite and regional groundwater contamination 
we also have indemnities that have covered  and that we expect will continue to cover  most of these environmental liabilities 
the indemnities were given to us by prior owners of the business  by a former operator of the facility and its insurer  by a prior owner s successor  and by a company with which we entered into a settlement indemnifying us for further regional groundwater contamination liabilities 
based on our agreement and our past dealings with these entities and the nature of their contractual commitments  we expect that they will continue to indemnify most of our environmental liabilities 
some of the entities could contest a future indemnification demand we could make for some aspects of our potential environmental liabilities 
we believe all of the entities are financially able to satisfy their indemnity obligations to us 
effects of inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash and receivables  are not significantly affected by inflation because they are short term in nature 
our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of inventory  intangible assets  goodwill and prepaid expenses and other assets  are not currently affected significantly by inflation 
we believe that replacement costs of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our cost of sales and expenses  such as those for employee compensation  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of the products offered by us 
forward looking statements this section and other parts of this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
in some cases  forward looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipates  expects  believes  plans  predicts  and similar terms 
such forward looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about our industry  management s beliefs and assumptions made by management 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to our dependence on a limited number of retailer customers  the loss of any of our retailer customers  fluctuations in buying decisions of our retailer customers  changes in general economic or market conditions  our ability to comply with covenants in our senior credit agreement  our ability to repay or refinance borrowings under the senior credit agreement  the competitive environment in our industry  the demand for our products  loss of any of our key employees  our ability to expand our product offerings  our ability to expand through new and existing distribution channels  our ability to manage our growth and sustain profitability  our ability to protect our intellectual property  our cash needs and financial performance  variations in product quality or delays in order fulfillment  our operations and our ability to achieve cost savings  our dependence on third party suppliers  increases in minimum wages  catastrophic losses or other disruptions at any of our facilities  the effect of regulatory and technological changes  risks associated with doing business outside of the united states and other factors discussed in item a 
risk factors risk related to our business and industry 
unless otherwise required by law  we expressly disclaim any obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we sell to canadian customers in canadian dollars and pay overseas suppliers and third party manufacturers in us dollars 
an increase in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar could result in lower net sales and higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
additionally  we hold canadian dollars in a cash account  which could result in higher unrealized foreign currency exchange losses due to a decrease in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
a decrease in the value of the euro and the chinese yuan relative to the us dollar could cause our suppliers to raise prices that would result in higher cost of sales 
the volatility of the applicable rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy 
our current sales to canadian customers and reliance on foreign suppliers for many of the raw materials and components used to produce products make it possible that our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate of the currencies of our customers and suppliers 
we do not have any foreign currency hedges 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowings under our revolving loan and term loan facilities 
interest on these borrowings is based upon variable interest rates 
our weighted average borrowings outstanding under our revolving loan and term loan facilities during the year ended december   was million and the weighted average interest rate in effect at december   was 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a  change to interest expense for the year ended december  as of march   the interest rate under the terms of the fourth amendment to the senior credit agreement was
