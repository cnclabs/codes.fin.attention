overview and outlook general in  brunswick significantly restructured its business in order to operate effectively in light of a difficult economic climate  while maintaining its strategic objective to solidify its leadership position in the marine  fitness and bowling billiards industries  by maintaining strong liquidity during difficult economic times  focusing on cost reduction initiatives across the organization through the resizing and realignment of brunswick s manufacturing operations and organizational structure  shrinking and consolidating its manufacturing footprint to a level that allows each facility to produce at higher volumes and lower costs  lowering its marine production levels to achieve reductions in pipeline inventories held by its dealers in order to maintain the health of the company s many dealers in a difficult retail environment  and distributing products through a model that benefits the company s dealers and distributors by providing additional products and services that will make them more successful  improve the customer experience and  in turn  make brunswick more successful 
accomplishments in support of the company s strategic objectives in include maintaining liquidity amended its revolving credit facility  which provides the company with an option to borrow for operating cash requirements  if necessary  and ended the year with million of cash  compared with million at the end of  despite a difficult economy 
manufacturing realignment adjustments to the manufacturing footprint to streamline operations  including permanent closure of eight facilities and the temporary closure of another three facilities  several boat manufacturing plants are now manufacturing multiple brands  rather than dedicated facilities for single brands  and reduced the number of models being manufactured in order to better utilize the new footprint and to reduce complexity and costs 
cost reduction initiatives reduced total company work force by percent  consolidated functions throughout the organization and removed layers of management  and exited or sold non strategic businesses and assets 
dealer health removed approximately  boats  or approximately percent  from dealer pipeline inventories  and extended its brunswick acceptance company  llc bac joint venture agreement with cdf ventures  llc  a subsidiary of ge capital corporation  through  providing brunswick s boat and engine dealers secured wholesale inventory floor plan financing 
international operations increased its focus in latin america and the middle east 
international sales now represent approximately percent of net sales from continuing operations 
despite its success in executing these objectives  brunswick saw a decline in its financial performance due to difficult marine market conditions and contracting global credit markets 
net sales from continuing operations in decreased to  million from  million in the overall decrease in sales was primarily due to the continued reduction in marine industry demand as a result of a weak global economy  soft housing markets and the contraction of liquidity in global credit markets 
the reduction in marine industry demand is evidenced by the declining number of retail unit sales of powerboats in the united states since  with the rate of decline accelerating during industry retail unit sales were down significantly during compared with the already low retail unit sales during in  the company reported higher sales in the bowling billiards segments  as well as higher sales outside the united states for the boat  fitness and bowling billiards segments 
these increases were more than offset by a reduction in the boat  marine engine and fitness segments sales in the united states 
operating losses from continuing operations for were million  with negative operating margins of percent 
operating earnings from continuing operations for were million  with operating margins of percent 
the results included goodwill and trade name impairment charges of million and million of restructuring  exit and other impairment charges  while the results included trade name impairment charges of million and million of restructuring  exit and other impairment charges 
the operating losses during primarily resulted from higher goodwill and trade name impairment charges  lower sales from marine operations  reduced fixed cost absorption due to reduced production rates in the company s marine businesses in an effort to achieve appropriate levels of dealer pipeline inventories and higher restructuring  exit and other impairment charges 
these factors were partially offset by successful cost reduction initiatives  as discussed in note restructuring activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in march  brunswick sold its interest in its bowling joint venture in japan for million gross cash proceeds  million net of cash paid for taxes and other costs 
the sale resulted in a million pretax gain  million after tax  and was recorded in investment sale gains in the consolidated statements of operations 
restructuring activities in november  brunswick announced restructuring initiatives to improve the company s cost structure  better utilize overall capacity and improve general operating efficiencies 
these initiatives reflected the company s response to a difficult marine market 
as the marine market has continued to decline  brunswick expanded its restructuring activities during  and in order to improve performance and better position the company to address current market conditions and enable long term profitable growth 
the company has reported its restructuring initiatives into three classifications exit activities  restructuring activities  and definite lived asset impairments 
the company considers employee termination costs  lease exit costs  inventory write downs and facility shutdown costs related to the sale of certain baja boat business assets  the closure of its bowling pin manufacturing facility  the potential sale of the valley dynamo coin operated commercial billiards business and the divestiture of mototron to be exit activities 
other employee termination costs  costs to retain and relocate employees  consulting costs and costs to consolidate the manufacturing footprint are considered restructuring activities 
definite lived impairments are costs related to the write downs of fixed assets  tooling  patents and proprietary technology  and customer relationships 
total restructuring  exit and other impairment charges in were million  which include million of gains recognized on the sales of non strategic assets 
the million consists of million in the boat segment  million in the marine engine segment  million in the fitness segment  million in the bowling billiards segment and million at corporate 
see note restructuring activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
the actions taken under these initiatives are expected to benefit future operations by removing fixed costs of approximately million from cost of sales and approximately million from selling  general and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations by the end of compared with spending levels 
the majority of these costs are expected to be cash savings once all restructuring initiatives are complete 
the company has begun to see savings related to these initiatives in and expects all savings to be realized by the end of goodwill and trade name impairments brunswick accounts for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas 
under this standard  brunswick assesses the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
during the third quarter of  brunswick encountered a significant adverse change in the business climate 
a weak us economy  soft housing markets and the contraction of liquidity in global credit markets contributed to the continued reduction in demand for certain brunswick products and  consequently  the reduced wholesale production rates for those affected products 
as a result of this reduced demand  along with lower than projected profits across certain brunswick brands and lower commitments received from its dealer network in the third quarter  management revised its future cash flow expectations in the third quarter of  which lowered the fair value estimates of certain businesses 
as a result of the lower fair value estimates  brunswick concluded that the carrying amounts of its boat segment and bowling retail and billiards reporting units within the bowling billiards segment exceeded their respective fair values 
the company compared the implied fair value of the goodwill in each reporting unit with the carrying value and concluded that a million pretax impairment charge needed to be recognized in the third quarter of of this amount  million relates to the boat segment reporting unit  million relates to the bowling retail reporting unit within the bowling billiards segment and million relates to the billiards reporting unit within the bowling billiards segment 
the company also recognized goodwill impairment charges of million in the boat segment reporting unit and million related to the billiards reporting unit within the bowling billiards segment earlier in as a result of deciding to exit certain businesses 
as a result of the million of impairments  all goodwill at these respective reporting units has been written down to zero 
in conjunction with the goodwill impairment testing  the company analyzed the valuation of its other indefinite lived intangibles  consisting exclusively of acquired trade names 
brunswick estimated the fair value of trade names by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the relief from royalty approach 
this approach treats the trade name as if it were licensed by the company rather than owned  and calculates its value based on the discounted cash flow of the projected license payments 
the analysis resulted in a pretax trade name impairment charge of million in the third quarter of  representing the excess of the carrying cost of the trade names over the calculated fair value 
of this amount  million relates to the boat segment reporting unit  million relates to the marine engine segment reporting unit and million relates to the billiards reporting unit within the bowling billiards segment 
the company also recognized trade name impairment charges of million in the boat segment reporting unit and million related to the billiards reporting unit within the bowling billiards segment earlier in as a result of deciding to exit certain businesses 
discontinued operations as discussed in note discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements  on april   the company announced its intention to sell the majority of the brunswick new technologies bnt business unit  consisting of the company s marine electronics  portable navigation device pnd and wireless fleet tracking businesses 
during the second quarter of  brunswick began reporting the results of these bnt businesses  which were previously reported in the marine engine segment  as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the company s results  as discussed in management s discussion and analysis  reflect continuing operations only  unless otherwise noted 
the company completed the divestiture of the bnt discontinued operations in outlook for looking ahead to  the company expects revenues to be lower when compared with  with higher relative percentage declines occurring in the first half of the year 
the expectation of lower revenues reflects the view that marine retail demand will continue to decline  at least through the first six months of the year  and that the company is planning to sell product at wholesale and manufacture at levels below marine retail demand 
operating earnings and margins for are expected to be adversely affected by the reduction in production and wholesale shipments  as discussed above 
these actions are expected to have an unfavorable effect on margins due to reduced gross margins on lower sales volumes and lower fixed cost absorption on reduced production 
these reductions in sales demand and production volumes  along with incremental pension related expenses of approximately million pretax and the possible resumption of variable compensation  are expected to lead to lower earnings and margins in when compared with earnings and margins before goodwill and trade name impairments 
partially offsetting these factors are expected to be nearly million of net cost reductions resulting from the full year effect of actions taken in and further cost reduction activities implemented and planned in also partially mitigating the impact of lower sales and production is the effect of lower restructuring charges of approximately million in versus more significant reductions in demand for the company s products may necessitate additional restructuring or exit charges in excluding the effect of any special tax items that may occur or any changes to tax legislation  brunswick is expecting to record a tax provision on operating losses in this is primarily the result of the expected inability to recognize tax benefits on projected domestic net operating losses and a projected tax provision on foreign earnings 
matters affecting comparability the following events have occurred during  and  which the company believes affect the comparability of the results of operations goodwill impairment charges 
as a result of the continued reduction in demand for certain brunswick products  along with lower than projected profits across certain brunswick brands  management revised its future cash flow expectations in the third quarter of the revised future cash flow expectations resulted in the company lowering its estimate of fair value of certain businesses and required the company to take a million pretax goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of  as prescribed by sfas in  the company incurred million of goodwill impairment charges  which include the aforementioned million  along with impairments related to the analyses of its baja boat business and its valley dynamo coin operated commercial billiards business in the second quarter of there were no comparable charges recognized in or see note goodwill and trade name impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
trade name impairment charges 
in conjunction with the goodwill impairment testing  the company analyzed the valuation of its trade names in accordance with sfas the analysis resulted in a pretax trade name impairment charge of million during the third quarter of  representing the excess of the carrying cost of the trade names over the calculated fair value 
this compares with a million pretax trade name impairment charge taken in the third quarter of as a result of a valuation analysis performed on certain outboard boat company trade names 
in  the company has taken million of trade name impairment charges  which include the aforementioned million and additional impairments related to the previous analyses of its bluewater marine boat business and its valley dynamo coin operated commercial billiards business in the second quarter of this charge compares with the million trade name impairment charge taken in  related to the impairment of certain outboard boat trade names

the decrease in net sales was primarily due to reduced marine industry demand compared with as a result of uncertainty in the global economy and the related contraction of liquidity in global credit markets 
weakness in marine retail demand was previously isolated to the united states  however  the recent uncertainty in the global economy has had an adverse effect on worldwide retail demand 
as a result of the prolonged decline in marine retail demand and tighter credit markets  a large dealer filed for bankruptcy in if additional dealers file for bankruptcy  brunswick s net sales and earnings from continuing operations may be unfavorably affected through lower market exposure and the associated decline in sales and the potential for the repurchase of brunswick products or recourse payments on customers debt obligations 
although net sales in were down percent from  the company saw strong sales of commercial fitness equipment and bowling products and experienced increases in revenue from brunswick zone xl centers 
sales outside the united states increased million to  million in  with the largest increase in contributions coming from the latin american region  which increased million to million  and the africa middle east region  which increased million to million 
the total growth outside the united states was largely attributable to higher sales from the boat  bowling billiards and fitness segments 
brunswick s gross margin percentage decreased basis points in to percent from percent in the decrease was primarily due to lower fixed cost absorption and inefficiencies due to reduced production rates  as a result of the company s efforts to achieve appropriate levels of marine customer pipeline inventories in light of lower retail demand  and higher raw material and component costs 
this decrease was partially offset by price increases at certain businesses  successful cost reduction efforts and lower variable compensation expense

the increase in net sales was primarily due to the strong performance of boat and engine sales outside the united states  higher fitness segment sales resulting from increased sales volumes  higher sales of marine parts and accessories  and sales gains at bowling retail entertainment centers 
these factors slightly outpaced the impact of continued reduction in united states marine industry demand 
sales outside the united states increased million to  million in  with the largest contributions coming from the european region  which increased million to  million  the latin american region  which increased million to million  and the asia pacific region  which increased million to million

the company incurred approximately million of costs in related to the potential sale and expects to incur additional costs of approximately million in the majority of the million charge relates to asset write downs 
the decrease in operating earnings was attributable to goodwill and trade name impairment charges  restructuring  exit and other impairment charges as well as the impact of lower sales of consumer and commercial billiards tables and lower non brunswick zone xl bowling retail entertainment sales 
partially offsetting this decrease was the impact of increased capital equipment sales  improved efficiency at the reynosa  mexico  bowling ball manufacturing facility  savings from successful cost reduction initiatives and the full year impact of recently opened brunswick zone xl centers 
decreased capital expenditures in were driven primarily by reduced spending for brunswick zone xl centers  as the company had more centers under construction during compared with vs 
bowling billiards segment net sales in decreased from prior year levels  primarily due to declines in sales of bowling products as a result of difficult market conditions  operational inefficiencies at the reynosa  mexico bowling ball facility  the absence of sales related to instant redemption games  where brunswick s supplier modified its distribution channel and began selling directly to retail entertainment centers  the loss of sales from divested bowling centers and a decline in valley dynamo coin operated billiards table sales 
this decrease has been partially offset by increased sales at three new brunswick zone xl centers and higher revenues at existing bowling centers 
the decrease in operating earnings was attributable to lower sales  additional costs associated with operational inefficiencies of the reynosa bowling ball plant  write downs taken on certain bowling center fixed assets where the carrying value was not expected to be fully recoverable  the absence of earnings from the instant redemption games discussed above  the lack of gains from sales of bowling centers in and higher costs associated with the start up of three new brunswick zone xl centers noted above 
this decrease was partially offset by the absence of losses from bowling centers disposed of during and improved warranty experience related to bowling products

free cash flow from continuing operations is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations  as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
the company uses this financial measure  both in presenting its results to shareholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses 
management believes that this financial measure and the information it provides are useful to investors because it permits investors to view the company s performance using the same tool that management uses to gauge progress in achieving its goals 
management believes that the non gaap financial measure free cash flow from continuing operations is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund further investments in future growth initiatives

additionally  the company experienced an increase of million in working capital in  compared with a decrease in working capital of million in working capital is defined as non cash current assets less current liabilities 
the increase in working capital was primarily the result of reductions in the company s accounts payable and accrued expenses relating to the reduced level of production activity  largely in the marine engine and boat segments  the cancellation of variable compensation for and lower accrued discounts during these declines were partially offset by lower inventories and lower trade receivables which were driven by reduced demand for its marine products 
cash flows from investing activities included capital expenditures of million  compared with million in there were no acquisitions in and  therefore no cash was paid during cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  totaled million in see note acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on brunswick s acquisitions 
additionally  cash flows from investing activities in benefited from the million in proceeds from the sale of its interest in its bowling joint venture in japan and its investment in a foundry located in mexico  as well as the million of proceeds from the sale of mototron and the million of proceeds from the sale of albemarle 
the company expects investments for capital expenditures in to be below levels as discretionary capital spending constraints will require the company to focus primarily on investments to maintain company operations and position it to respond when marine markets recover 
cash flows from financing activities of continuing operations resulted in a use of cash of million in compared with million in the decrease was due to a reduction in the dividend declared to per share in compared with a per share dividend declared in the dividends resulted in dividend payouts of million in and million in additionally  no shares were repurchased in  compared with million of share repurchases in the company did not receive any cash from stock options exercised in  compared with million in also  included in net issuances of short term debt is million of fees that were incurred in in connection with the amendment to the company s revolving credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of december   a decrease of million from million in total debt as of december  and december   was million and million  respectively 
brunswick s debt to capitalization ratio increased to percent as of december   from percent as of december   as a result of current year losses from continuing operations and the loss of value in the assets supporting the pension plan 
from time to time  the company utilizes short term borrowings to fund interim working capital requirements  particularly during the first half of the calendar year 
in the past  if short term borrowings were required  the company issued commercial paper  which was supported with a revolving credit facility 
the company s corporate credit ratings were lowered throughout  with standard and poor s rating services currently assigning a rating of b and moody s investors service currently assigning a rating of b at current ratings levels  the company no longer has access to commercial paper markets as a short term borrowing source 
the company has a million revolving credit facility facility in place with a group of banks  as described in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  the company converted the facility into a million secured  asset based facility  which remains in place through may borrowings under this facility are subject to the value of the borrowing base  consisting of certain cash balances  accounts receivable  inventory  and machinery and equipment of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
as of december   the borrowing base totaled million and available capacity totaled million  net of million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
the december   borrowing base does not include any values for machinery and equipment or cash  which will be added when required documentation is completed 
the borrowing base will be affected by changes in eligible collateral in future periods 
the facility contains a minimum fixed charges coverage covenant  which is effective when the available borrowing capacity under the facility falls below certain thresholds 
there were no loan borrowings under the facility in or the company has the ability to issue up to million in letters of credit under the facility 
the company pays a facility fee of to basis points per annum  which is based on the daily average utilization of the facility 
the borrowing rate  as calculated in accordance with the facility  was as of december continued weakness in the marine marketplace can jeopardize the financial stability of the company s dealers 
specifically  dealer inventory levels may be higher than desired  inventory may be aging beyond preferred levels and dealers may experience reduced cash flow 
these factors may impair a dealer s ability to meet payment obligations to brunswick or to third party financing sources and obtain financing for new product 
if a dealer is unable to meet its obligations to third party financing sources  brunswick may be required to repurchase a portion of its own products from these third party financing sources 
see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
while there can be no assurances in light of the current economic environment  with the amended revolving credit facility in place  management believes that available cash balances  along with free cash flow  are expected to be adequate to fund the company s near term operating cash requirements 
management believes that  in spite of recent credit rating downgrades  the company has access to adequate sources of liquidity and financing to meet the company s short term and long term needs

accordingly  the company revised the consolidated statement of cash flows 
net cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities have not changed 
in  net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations totaled million  compared with million in this decrease was caused by a million decline in net earnings from continuing operations  adjusted for the non cash pretax impairment charge of million million after tax 
the decrease in net earnings from continuing operations was primarily offset by more favorable changes in working capital between periods as the company experienced a million decrease in working capital  defined as non cash current assets less current liabilities  in versus a million increase in the favorable change in working capital was driven by a decrease in cash variable compensation payouts during  as well as increased accrued promotional incentives in the boat and engine segments  compared with prior year 
these factors were partially offset by operating cash used to fund inventory increases in  compared with although production rates were lowered to help achieve reduced levels of marine pipeline inventories  increases in inventory balances exceeded those in the prior year as a result of the reduction in retail demand for both boats and engines  higher engine inventories to support growth in markets outside the united states  acquisitions completed during and the ramp up of production at the company s hatteras facility in swansboro  north carolina  which opened in late  as well as the navassa facility acquired in july additionally  accounts receivable balances increased due to growth in marine sales outside the united states  which carry longer terms

legal proceedings see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the potential cash requirements related to legal and environmental proceedings 
environmental regulation in its marine engine segment  brunswick will continue to develop engine technologies to reduce engine emissions to comply with current and future emissions requirements 
the costs associated with these activities may have an adverse effect on marine engine segment operating margins and may affect short term operating results 
the state of california adopted regulations that required catalytic converters on sterndrive and inboard engines that became effective on january  other environmental regulatory bodies in the united states and other countries may also impose higher emissions standards than are currently in effect for those regions 
the company expects to comply fully with these regulations  but compliance will increase the cost of these products for the company and the industry 
the boat segment continues to pursue fiberglass boat manufacturing technologies and techniques to reduce air emissions at its boat manufacturing facilities 
the company does not believe that compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on brunswick s competitive position 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
if current estimates for the cost of resolving any specific matters are later determined to be inadequate  results of operations could be adversely affected in the period in which additional provisions are required 
the company records a reserve when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company establishes its reserve based on its best estimate within a range of losses 
if the company is unable to identify the best estimate  the company records the minimum amount in the range 
the company has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on brunswick s reported results 
revenue recognition and sales incentives 
the company s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats  marine engines  fitness equipment  bowling products  retail bowling activities and billiards tables 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale  primarily upon shipment to customers  once the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
brunswick offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotional activities and rebates 
the estimated liability for sales incentives is recorded at the later of the time of program communication to the customer or at the time of sale in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor s products 
the liability is estimated based on the costs for the incentive program  the planned duration of the program and historical experience 
if actual costs are different from estimated costs  the recorded value of the liability and revenue is adjusted 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible trade receivables based upon currently known bad debt risks and provides reserves based on loss history  customer payment practices and economic conditions 
actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of reserves 
the company also provides a reserve based on historical  current and estimated future purchasing levels in connection with its long term notes receivables for brunswick s supply agreements 
these assumptions are re evaluated considering the customer s financial position and product purchase volumes 
changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required if a future event or other circumstance results in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectibility of a specific account or note 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories in order to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value 
fair market value can be affected by assumptions about market demand and conditions  historical usage rates  model changes and new product introductions 
if model changes or new product introductions create more or less than favorable market conditions  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventories may need to be adjusted 
warranty reserves 
the company records a liability for standard product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the liability is recorded using historical warranty experience to estimate projected claim rates and expected costs per claim 
if necessary  the company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
the company s warranty reserves are affected by product failure rates and material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if these estimated costs differ from actual product failure rates and actual material usage and labor costs  a revision to the warranty reserve would be required 
restructuring 
from time to time  the company engages in actions associated with cost reduction initiatives which are accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the company s restructuring actions require significant estimates including a expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  b remaining lease obligations  including sublease income  and c other exit costs 
the company has accrued amounts that it believes are its best estimates of the obligations it expects to incur in connection with these actions  but these estimates are subject to change due to market conditions and final negotiations 
should the actual amounts differ from the originally estimated amounts  brunswick s earnings could decrease 
the company recognized million  million and million in restructuring charges in  and  respectively  which are discussed in more detail in note restructuring activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
in assessing the value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  management relies on a number of factors to value anticipated future cash flows including operating results  business plans and present value techniques 
rates used to value and discount cash flows are dependent upon royalty rate assumptions  interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of intangible asset impairment 
it is possible that operating results or assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
litigation 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to claims and litigation  including obligations assumed or retained as part of acquisitions and divestitures 
the company accrues for litigation exposure based upon its assessment  made in consultation with counsel  of the likely range of exposure stemming from the claim 
in light of existing reserves  the company s litigation claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
environmental 
the company accrues for environmental remediation related activities for which commitments or clean up plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated 
accrued amounts are generally determined in coordination with third party experts on an undiscounted basis and do not consider recoveries from third parties until such recoveries are realized 
in light of existing reserves  the company s environmental claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
self insurance reserves 
the company records a liability for self insurance obligations  which include employee related health care benefits and claims for workers compensation  product liability  general liability and auto liability 
in estimating the obligations associated with self insurance reserves  the company primarily uses loss development factors based on historical claim experience  which incorporate anticipated exposure for losses incurred  but not yet reported 
these loss development factors are used to estimate ultimate losses on incurred claims 
actual costs associated with a specific claim can vary from an earlier estimate 
if the facts were to change  the liability recorded for expected costs associated with a specific claim may need to be revised 
postretirement benefit reserves 
postretirement costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions  including the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets  the annual rate of increase in compensation for plan employees  the increase in costs of health care benefits and other factors 
the company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
postretirement benefit reserves are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
effective december   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
in  the company recorded an increase to its deferred tax asset valuation allowance due to uncertainty surrounding the realization of certain net deferred tax assets using the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the company estimates its tax obligations based on historical experience and current tax laws and litigation 
the judgments made at any point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and settlements of tax litigation  as well as changes due to new tax laws and regulations and the company s application of those laws and regulations 
these factors may cause the company s tax rate and deferred tax balances to increase or decrease

these risks include  but are not limited to  those set forth under item a of this report 
caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on the company s forward looking statements  which represent the company s views only as of the date this report is filed 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
the company enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks in accordance with guidelines established by the company s management 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign exchange exposure related to anticipated transactions  and assets and liabilities that are subject to risk from foreign currency rate changes 
the company s principal currency exposures relate to the euro  japanese yen  canadian dollar  australian dollar  british pound and new zealand dollar 
hedging of anticipated transactions is accomplished with financial instruments whose maturity date  along with the realized gain or loss  occurs on or near the execution of the anticipated transaction 
the company manages foreign currency exposure of assets or liabilities through the use of derivative financial instruments such that the gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument offsets the loss or gain recognized on the asset or liability  respectively 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the effect that changes in interest rates have on the fair market value of the company s debt and to lower the company s borrowing costs on current or anticipated issuances of debt 
the company s net exposure to interest rate risk is primarily attributable to its outstanding debt 
interest rate risk management is accomplished through the use of fixed to floating interest rate swaps  forward starting floating to fixed interest rate swaps and floating rate instruments that are benchmarked to us and european short term money market interest rates 
raw materials used by the company are exposed to the effect of changing commodity prices 
accordingly  the company uses commodity swap agreements  futures contracts and supplier agreements to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases of certain raw materials  including aluminum and natural gas 
the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  interest rate risk and commodity price risk 
the company uses a model to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates  interest rate yield curves and commodity prices 
for options and instruments with nonlinear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts
