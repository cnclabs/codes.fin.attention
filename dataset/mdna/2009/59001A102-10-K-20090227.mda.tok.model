item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook industry conditions during  the financial crisis and economic recession further exacerbated the existing downturn in the homebuilding market and resulted in additional downward pressure on home sales and asset values 
based on statistics from the mortgage bankers association  processed foreclosures reached approximately million in the last quarter of as compared to an average of about  per quarter during these record high foreclosure rates intensified competition for homebuyers in an already saturated marketplace with the influx of existing homes inventory  coupled with the lack of availability of mortgage financing resulting from the turmoil in the financial industry 
concern about the state of the economy and the job market further deteriorated consumer confidence  as unemployment rates rose in almost all of the metropolitan areas tracked by the us department of labor  ending with a national average of as compared to in the prior year 
we believe that the tepid demand we are experiencing reflects homebuyers reluctance to make a purchasing decision until they are comfortable that the price declines are near bottom and that economic conditions have stabilized 
we believe the current conditions could continue  and potentially worsen during  and we expect that our operations will continue to remain depressed until the homebuilding industry and economy as a whole begin to rebound 
summary company results our results for the year ended december  reflect the continued deterioration in the homebuilding and credit industries  as well as the recession that has impacted the us economy during total home closing revenue was billion for the year ended december   decreasing from billion for and from billion in we incurred a net loss for of million compared to a loss of million in and earnings of million in our results include million pre tax of real estate related impairments and a million deferred tax valuation allowance charge 
in  we incurred million pre tax of goodwill related impairments and million pre tax of real estate related impairments and in  we had million pre tax of real estate impairments 
lower average home prices from competitive pressures and the 
table of contents increased use of incentives over the last two years lowered gross margins generated on home closings to in  from and  respectively  in and at december   our backlog of approximately million was down from million at december  our december  backlog was billion 
fewer home sales  compounded by increased price concessions and incentives and higher cancellation rates  were primarily responsible for these declines 
our average sales price for homes in backlog decreased from  at december  to  at december  and was  at december  our cancellation rate on sales orders remained above our historical rates and was  and  respectively  as a percentage of gross sales  for the years ended december   and we do not expect that cancellation rates will begin to stabilize and begin to trend back to normal historical levels until the excess supply of existing home inventory is absorbed and home prices start to level 
company actions and positioning in response to industry conditions  we are focusing on the following initiatives winding down under performing operations and consolidating overhead functions at all of our divisions and corporate offices to reduce general and administrative cost burden  reducing our total lot supply by renegotiating or opting out of lot purchase and option contracts  limiting unsold home inventory  redesigning product offering to reduce sales prices and improve affordability  exercising tight control over cash flows  changing sales and marketing efforts to generate additional traffic  renegotiating construction costs with our subcontractors where possible  and monitoring our customer satisfaction scores and making improvements based on the results of the surveys our credit facility matures in may in july  we amended our credit facility to i eliminate the individual quarterly interest coverage test  ii provide additional cushion by relaxing the minimum interest coverage  maximum leverage and tangible net worth covenants  iii reduce the borrowing capacity to million from million  iv increase the applicable interest rate by up to basis points  v increase the unused commitment fee by basis points depending on the company s leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement  vi modify the advance rates by to for various components and reduce the maximum amounts of certain types of real estate that may be owned at any given time  and vii modify various other terms 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the preparation and presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of these consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that may have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and revenue and costs 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic  environmental and political factors and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are revised when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in methodologies are reflected in our reported results of operations and  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates we use and believe to be critical to our business are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions we have made  actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations  particularly as related to our ability to accurately estimate tax valuation allowances  stock based compensation  accruals  or impairments of real estate that could result in charges  or income  in future periods  which relate to activities or transactions in a preceding period 

table of contents the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us  and involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  are as follows revenue recognition in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  we recognize revenue from home sales when title passes to the homeowner  the homeowner s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home  the receivable  if any  from the homeowner is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the sold home 
these conditions are typically achieved when a home closes 
revenue from land sales is recognized when a significant down payment is received  the earnings process is relatively complete  title passes and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured 
real estate real estate is stated at cost unless the community or land is determined to be impaired  at which point the inventory is written down to fair value as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

inventory includes the costs of land acquisition  land development and home construction  capitalized interest  real estate taxes  direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction that benefit the entire community and impairments  if any 
land and development costs are typically allocated to individual lots on a relative value basis and are transferred to homes under construction when construction begins 
home construction costs are accumulated on a per home basis 
cost of home closings includes the specific construction costs of the home and all related land acquisition  land development and other common costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community or phase 
any changes to the estimated total development costs of a community or phase are allocated on a relative value basis to the remaining homes in the community or phase 
when a home closes  we may have incurred costs for goods and services that have not yet been paid 
in such cases  an accrual to capture such obligations is recorded in connection with the home closing and charged directly to cost of sales 
typically  a community s life cycle ranges from three to five years  commencing with the acquisition of the entitled land and continuing through the land development phase and concluding with the sale  construction and closing of the homes 
actual community lives will vary based on the size of the community  the absorption rates and whether the land purchased was raw or finished lots 
master planned communities encompassing several phases and super block land parcels may have significantly longer lives and projects involving finished lot purchases may be significantly shorter 
additionally  the current slow down in the housing market has negatively impacted our sales pace  thereby extending the lives of certain communities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 all of our land inventory and related real estate assets are reviewed for recoverability when impairment indicators are present  as our inventory is considered long lived in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
if an asset is deemed not recoverable  sfas no 
requires impairment charges to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts 
our determination of fair value is based on projections and estimates 
changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis 
our analysis is completed on a quarterly basis at a community level with each community or land parcel evaluated individually 
we pay particular attention to communities experiencing a larger than anticipated reduction in their absorption rates or averages sales prices 
for those assets deemed to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds their fair value 
the impairment of a community is allocated to each lot on a straight line basis 
existing and continuing communities when projections for the remaining income expected to be earned from existing communities are no longer positive  the underlying real estate assets are deemed not fully recoverable  and further analysis is performed to determine the required impairment 
with each community or land parcel evaluated individually  the fair value of the community s assets is determined using either a discounted cash flow model for projects we intend to build out or a market based approach for projects we intend to sell or that are in the preliminary development stage and product types have not yet been finalized 
impairments are charged to cost of home closings in the period during which the fair value is less than the assets carrying amount 
if a market based approach is used  we determine fair value based on recent comparable purchase and sales activity in the local market  adjusted for known variances as determined by our knowledge of the region and general real estate expertise 
our key estimates in deriving fair value under our cash flow model are i home selling prices in the community adjusted for current and expected sales discounts and incentives  ii costs related to the community both land development and home construction including costs spent to date and budgeted remaining costs to spend  iii projected sales absorption rates  reflecting any product mix change strategies implemented to stimulate the sales pace  iv alternative land uses including disposition of all or a portion of the land owned and v our discount rate  which is 
table of contents currently 
these assumptions vary widely across different communities and geographies and are largely dependent on local market conditions 
community level factors that may impact our key estimates include the presence and significance of local competitors  including their offered product type and competitive actions  economic and related demographic conditions for the population of the surrounding community  and desirability of the particular community  including unique amenities or other favorable or unfavorable attributes 
these local circumstances may significantly impact our assumptions and the resulting computation of fair value  and are  therefore  closely evaluated by our division personnel in their creation of the discounted cash flow models 
the models are also evaluated by regional and corporate personnel for consistency and integration  as decisions that affect pricing or absorption at one community may have resulting consequences for neighboring communities 
we typically do not project market improvements in our discounted cash flow models  but may do so in limited circumstances in the latter years of a long lived master planned community 
option deposits and pre acquisition costs we also evaluate assets associated with future communities for impairments on a quarterly basis 
using similar techniques described in the existing and continuing communities section above  we determine if the contributions to be generated by our future communities are acceptable to us 
if the projections indicate that a community is still profitable and generating acceptable margins  those assets are determined to be fully recoverable and no impairments are required 
in cases where we decide to abandon the project  we will fully impair all assets related to such project and will expense and accrue any additional costs that we are contractually obligated to incur 
we may also elect to continue with a project because it has positive future cash flows  even though it may not be generating an accounting profit  or because of other strategic factors 
in such cases  we will impair our pre acquisition costs and deposits  as necessary  to record an impairment to bring the book value to fair value 
during  we recorded million of such impairment charges related to our home and land real estate inventories and real estate related joint venture investments 
additionally  we wrote off million of deposits and pre acquisition costs relating to projects that were no longer economically feasible 
refer to note of these consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further discussion regarding these impairments and the associated remaining fair values of impaired communities 
the impairment charges were based on our fair value calculations  which are affected by current market conditions  assumptions and expectations  all of which are highly subjective and may differ significantly from actual results if market conditions change 
due to the volume of possible outcomes that can be generated from changes in the various model inputs for each community  we do not believe it is possible to create a sensitivity analysis that can provide meaningful information for the users of our financial statements 
warranty reserves we use subcontractors for nearly all aspects of home construction 
although our subcontractors are generally required to repair and replace any product or labor defects  we are ultimately responsible to the homeowner for making such repairs 
as such  warranty reserves are recorded to cover our exposure to absorb the costs for materials and labor not expected to be covered by our subcontractors as they relate to warranty type claims subsequent to the delivery of a home to the homeowner 
reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and  with the assistance of an actuary  we determine their sufficiency based on our and industry wide historical data and trends with respect to product types and geographical areas 
at december   our warranty reserve was million  reflecting an accrual of to of a home s sale price depending on our loss history in the geographic area in which the home was built 
a increase in our warranty reserve rate would have increased our accrual and corresponding cost of sales by million in while we believe that the warranty reserve is sufficient to cover our projected costs  there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements during the normal course of business  we invest in entities that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties 
our partners generally are unaffiliated homebuilders  land sellers and financial or other strategic partners 
all unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by either the cost or the equity method of accounting as the criteria for consolidation set forth in fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r have not been met 
we record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of earnings as loss earnings from unconsolidated entities  net 
we determine if we are the primary beneficiary of  or have a controlling interest in  an unconsolidated entity 
factors considered in our determination include the profit loss sharing terms of the entity  experience and financial condition of the other partners  voting rights  involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement 
as of december   we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary  we do not have a controlling interest  and our ownership interest exceeds 
at december   our equity investments of million related to unconsolidated entities with total assets of million and total liabilities of million 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these investments 
we also enter into option or purchase agreements to acquire land or lots  for which we generally pay non refundable deposits 
we analyze these agreements under fin r to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity vie  if applicable  using a model developed by management 
if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  we will consolidate the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for additional information related to our off balance sheet arrangements 
in cases where we are the primary beneficiary  we consolidate these purchase option agreements and reflect such assets and liabilities as real estate not owned in our consolidated balance sheets 
the liabilities related to consolidated vies are excluded from our debt covenant calculations 
valuation of deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of both temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 we evaluate our deferred tax assets  including net operating losses  to determine if a valuation is required 
sfas no 
requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the length of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with operating losses and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
our current and prior year losses presented significant negative evidence that we needed to reduce our deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance 
given the continued downturn in the homebuilding industry during  the degree of the economic recession  the current instability and deterioration of the financial markets  and the resulting uncertainty in projections of our future taxable income  we determined the weight of the negative evidence exceeded that of the positive evidence during and that it was more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets 
therefore  we have recorded a full valuation allowance on the remaining deferred tax asset balance  which increased losses from continuing operations by million  or per share  during income tax receivable consisted of tax refunds that we expect to receive within one year 
our income tax receivable balance at december  and was million and million  respectively 

table of contents share based payments we have stock options and restricted common stock units nonvested shares outstanding under two stock compensation plans 
per the terms of these plans  the exercise price of our stock options may not be less than the closing market value of our common stock on the date of grant  nor may options granted under the plans be exercised within one year from the date of the grant 
after one year  exercises are permitted in pre determined installments based upon a vesting schedule established at the time of grant 
each stock option expires on a date determined at the time of the grant  but not to exceed seven years from the date of the grant 
the calculation of employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management judgments 
these estimates include determining the value of each of our stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model discussed in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of our stock options  which typically vest ratably over a five year period  is determined at the time of grant and is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting life of the options 
expected volatility is based on a composite of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility from our traded options 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the rate of a zero coupon treasury bond on the date the stock option is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option 
we use historical data to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model 
the expected life of our stock option awards is derived from historical experience under our share based payment plans and represents the period of time that we expect our stock options to be outstanding 
a decrease in our forfeiture rate would have increased our stock compensation by approximately  in

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closings for the year ended december  decreased million or when compared to the prior year  primarily due to the  reduction in units closed with a  lower average closing price 
lower sales volume of  units in as compared to  in  reflects the reduced demand caused by the industry downturn and the economic recession 
absorptions were further impacted by cancellation rates of in the current year  only a basis point improvement from our historical high of in the lower sales volumes coupled with steady closings resulted in a decrease to our backlog of  units in  down to  homes as compared to  homes in in addition  the decrease in our actively selling community count from at december  to at december  also impacted our sales  closings and backlog levels during despite our increased selling efforts and larger incentives and discounts  these decreases reflect successive quarters of lower demand as a result of the homebuilding industry downturn 
the economic recession further amplified the pressure on sales prices and the lack of potential homebuyers commitment to a new home purchase during these uncertain times 
additionally  the influx of foreclosures  increases in unemployment rates and the tighter lending standards for obtaining mortgage financing during the current credit crisis both for our homebuyers as well as for the buyers of their existing homes also dampened demand 
we believe these trends will continue until buyers perceive that the downturn is near bottom and economic conditions have stabilized 
we believe our buyers will return as the stabilization of home prices signals that they won t experience a significant erosion of the value of their new home purchase 
west 
in  home closings decreased to units with a value of million  a or million decrease in home closing revenue as compared to  primarily driven by the performance of our california markets 
the region s cancellation rate of contributed to the unit decrease in closings as compared to  which also impacted our ending backlog of million  a million decrease from the prior year 
in addition to the market factors noted above  the region s decreases reflect the market s response to the rapid price appreciation experienced in the early part of the decade in both california and nevada  now further exacerbated by the oversupply of available inventory coupled with limited availability of mortgage financing 
we expect that these lower prices will continue to affect the region s closings  sales and backlog throughout central 
the central region s current year closings of  deliveries generating billion of revenues are and lower than those reported in  respectively 
although texas remained our strongest market during  in the latter part of the year  it had also begun to experience noticeable slowing as indicated by its cancellation rate of in  a basis point increase from in arizona continues to struggle with an oversupply of inventory contributing to the region s  unit decline in home orders in the slower absorption rates and increased use of incentives led to a unit decline in ending backlog as of december   with average sales prices of  in  as compared to  in although we expect to continue to experience some deterioration in this region until conditions stabilize  as texas still has strong job and population growth and did not experience the significant price appreciation in prior years that benefited some of our other markets  we believe the impact of the downturn will be less severe in our texas communities 
east 
we generated closings with million of corresponding home revenue in the decline in deliveries from is attributed to both the slowing market  as well as the wind down of our ft 
myers operation in mid  where we are now closed out 
the cancellation rate of in and in also underscore the continuing difficulties experienced in this part of the country  leading to a unit decline in our sales to sold units as compared to in the impact of slowing sales and close out of ft

florida has historically sold a portion of its homes to international investors

fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closing revenue decreased to billion in  as compared or our company record revenue of billion in the sharp decline in the homebuilding markets throughout late and translated to a  unit decrease in home closings and an decrease in the average sales price in as compared to throughout  the unrest in the market was evident through lower sales volume due to buyer uncertainty and an increase in the cancellation rate to from in we decreased sales prices and increased incentives and discounts in order to find the local market niche 
these steady closings during were only partially offset with new sales  leading to the or million decrease in backlog at december  as compared to our ending balances of  units and billion in backlog in the prior year 

table of contents the sharp contrast between the and results highlights the rapid decline in the homebuilding market experienced during late  which continued throughout our results benefited from home sale contracts entered into during early and late  the peak of this homebuilding cycle 
west 
the deterioration of the homebuilding markets in was most evident in our west region  which experienced a dramatic market correction from the peak of the market up cycle in the lower closing volume created downward pricing pressure and resulted in an increased use of incentives  translating to a decrease in average price per closing of to  per home in  as compared to  per home in the average price decrease along with the unit decrease in closings contributed to the million decline in closing revenue to million versus billion in the prior year 
tighter mortgage underwriting standards and low consumer confidence also impacted the sales for this region in  with cancellations reaching  a contributing factor to the fewer units sold in when compared to the aggregate impact of these external market forces led to a million decrease in our backlog at december  to million from the prior year end balance of million 
central 
the central region s declines in were primarily impacted by poor performance in arizona  which experienced an oversupply of both new and existing available homes inventory 
the unwillingness of buyers to commit to a new home purchase was evident in the million and  unit declines in home closings in the state and comprised the entire home revenue decline in the region for as compared to although texas also experienced some weakening in its sales volumes  since it did not participate as much in the rapid price appreciation and strong demand experienced in many other markets  its overall declines were moderate through  which helped hold the region s sales units and dollars declines to and  with cancellation rates of and for versus  respectively 
the steady closings in this region from prior year sales together with the slowing absorptions resulted in an ending backlog of  units with a value of million at december   decreases of and from east

myers operations  which was the primary cause of the million and unit reduction in home closings in compared to our cancellation rate improved to in compared to a record high in  while our sales volumes increased units to home orders with a value of million in from million in the improved sales performance in is attributable to both the higher community count in our central florida division as well as the somewhat improved sales results for ft

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closing gross margin declined to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this nominal decline is primarily due to declines in the average sales price of homes of in as compared to  which was partially offset by lower levels of impairments recorded in totaling million versus million in margins in also benefited from a lower basis for our inventory resulting from prior period impairments as discussed below 
excluding current period impairments  gross margins were and for and  respectively 
the decreases in gross margins excluding impairments are primarily the result of declines in average sales prices of home deliveries  partially offset by cost savings from re negotiated construction contracts and a lower asset basis for homes closed from prior period impairments 
we provide gross margins excluding impairments a non gaap term as we use it to evaluate our performance and believe it is a widely accepted financial measure by users of our financial statements in analyzing our operating results and provides comparability to similar calculations by our peers in the homebuilding industry 
as reflected in our lower average sales prices in our orders and backlog  the types of incentives we offer vary by market  community and model and may include discounts on home prices  free or discounted upgrades and options  and the payment of a portion of buyer closing costs 
these incentives  which impact sales prices  can be expected to have an adverse effect on our gross and net margins over the next several quarters 
however  as previously noted  we are scaling back on standard features offered in our base home models  designing smaller homes that are more efficiently constructed and re bidding construction material and labor contracts  targeting a reduction from peak construction costs of mid to late these savings should allow us to offer more affordable homes and compete for a larger base of potential homebuyers  with a focus on the first time and first move up demographics 
west 
our west region improved its home closing gross loss to a negative margin of for from a negative margin of in these margins included impairments of million in versus million in the prior year 
excluding these impairments  the gross margins for and were and  respectively 
the slight improvement in our pre impairment gross margins is due to the lower basis in our homes from prior impairments  as well as the benefits realized from the cost reductions noted above  partially offset by the continued use of discounts and incentives as previously noted in the lower average closing prices for this region 
central 
the central region s home closing gross profit decreased basis points as compared to in despite these decreases  margins in this region remained positive due to the relatively stronger market and lower levels of impairments recorded in texas 
the decreases are mainly attributed to the decrease in pricing power in arizona  resulting in increased incentives and discounts and the continuing real estate impairments in  as compared to the prior year 
the central region s home closing gross margins include million of real estate related impairments for compared to million for east 
this region  like the west  experienced a home closing gross loss  with negative gross margins of for as compared to for the prior year 
the home closing gross losses are primarily due to decreasing average sales prices and million of real estate related impairments during the impairment charges in the prior year were million 
excluding these impairments  gross margins would have been for the region for and for fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closing gross margin declined to at december  as compared to at december  the decline is attributed to million of impairments and  to a lesser degree  the average close price decrease for the year ended december  as compared to december  the impairments were million 
margins were also impacted by the shift of the companywide mix of closings from our west region to the central region  which historically has experienced lower margins 
the gross margins excluding impairments for and were and  respectively 
west 
our west region experienced a significant drop in home closing gross profit to a gross loss of million for  due to real estate related impairments and the continuing trends of lower average sales price driven by weak demand 
gross profit was million in  a difference of million 
the region recorded million and million of impairments for and  respectively  which impacted the home closing gross margins by and in the same periods 
excluding these impairments  gross margin would have been and for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents central 
the central region experienced a basis point decrease in gross profit percentage in to as compared to the decrease is attributed to both the decrease in pricing power in arizona  as well as the shift in the region s mix to texas closings  as texas  which has historically had lower home gross margins  continues to become a more significant portion of the region s total sales and closings 
the central region also recorded million of impairments and write downs compared to million in east 
the east region had home closing negative margin of during the gross loss is due to both the inventory impairments recorded during  as well as the weakened homebuilding market  particularly in ft

commissions and other sales costs are comprised of internal and external commissions and related sales and marketing expenses such as advertising and sales office costs 
as a percentage of home closing revenue  these costs increased to for from for these increases primarily reflect additional costs incurred for intensified sales and marketing efforts across our markets combined with lower average prices obtained per home closing general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses represent corporate and divisional overhead expenses such as salaries and bonuses  occupancy  insurance and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million for versus the decrease includes million received from a successful legal settlement in the second quarter of the balance includes a million non cash compensation charge related to a tender offer where we repurchased certain previously issued stock options 
although we continue to execute on our cost cutting and streamlining strategy  particularly in headcount and salary expense reductions  the significant revenue decline resulted in our general and administrative expenses remaining steady as a percentage of home closing revenue 
excluding these one time charges  our general and administrative expenses were and of total revenue for and  respectively 
goodwill and intangible asset impairments during  we fully impaired our remaining intangibles related to the acquisition of greater homes in orlando 
the million impairment is reported in our goodwill and intangible asset impairments line in our statement of operations 
in  we wrote off million of our goodwill and related intangible assets as a result of the weakened homebuilding market and accounting valuation techniques that incorporate the declining stockpiles in deriving the fair value of our reporting units 
these charges resulted in a complete write down of all of our remaining goodwill 
interest expense 
interest expense is comprised of interest incurred  but not capitalized  on our senior and senior subordinated notes  credit facility and other borrowings

commissions and other sales costs  such as advertising and sales office expenses  increased as a percent of home closing revenue to in from in this increase was primarily due to the weakened housing markets and lower revenue volume  which also resulted in the increased involvement of external real estate agents who are paid a higher commission than our internal sales force  and additional sales and marketing efforts targeted at improving our competitiveness in this challenging market 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to of total revenue in from in the decrease is primarily attributed to our concentrated efforts to control overhead expenses  a million reduction in dollars of administrative expenses in as compared to the reductions are mostly due to lower salaries and compensation expense resulting from decreases in employee head count and other cost cutting measures 
additionally  the balance includes a million non cash stock compensation charge related to a tender offer where we repurchased certain previously issued stock options  and the balance includes million of severance costs  primarily from the resignation of our former co ceo 
goodwill and intangible asset impairments in  we wrote off million of our goodwill and related intangible assets as a result of the weakened homebuilding market and accounting valuation techniques that incorporate the declining stock prices in deriving the fair value of our reporting units 
these charges resulted in a complete write down of all of our remaining goodwill 
we had no such impairments in interest expense 
as discussed above  our level of inventory eligible for interest capitalization dropped below the balance of our debt late in  resulting in an interest charge of million to our statement of operations 
as our eligible inventory exceeded the associated debt in  all interest was capitalized and there were no such respective charges 
income taxes 
income taxes benefit was million in compared to an expense of million in as a percent of pre tax earnings  taxes were in  down from in the decrease in the effective rate in is attributed to a decrease in the allowable tax deduction for domestic manufacturing  a reduction adjustment made to a prior year domestic manufacturing deduction due to the carry back of our current federal pretax loss  decreases in unrecognized tax benefits  and decreases in state tax benefits for the current year due to the valuation allowance against state deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources overview our principal uses of capital for and were operating expenses  home construction and the payment of various liabilities 
we used funds generated by operations to meet our short term working capital requirements 
cash flows for each of our communities depend on the status of the development cycle  and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions  plat and other approvals  and construction of model homes  roads  utilities  general landscaping and other amenities 
because these costs are a component of our inventory and not recognized in our statement of operations until a home closes  we incur significant cash outlays prior to recognition of earnings 
in the later stages of a community  cash inflows may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as the cash outflow associated with home and land construction was previously incurred 
from a liquidity standpoint  we are currently experiencing the positive effects of the homebuilding cash flow cycle 
over the last several quarters  our debt balances have decreased and our cash balances have increased as our community count declines 
as these older communities are closing out  our inventory volumes decrease and we are generating positive cash flow which is not offset by initial cash outflows for new subdivisions 

table of contents we exercise strict controls and believe we have a defined strategy for company wide cash management  particularly as related to cash outlays for land and inventory development 
we are also maintaining our long standing position of being a built to order builder by minimizing unsold home construction  although we are targeting four to five spec homes per community to have sufficient on hand inventory to accommodate any immediate move in demands from first time buyers or buyers who have recently sold their homes and are wanting a quick move in 
executing on our strategy of reducing inventory and curtailing spending on under performing assets  we generated million of positive operating cash flows in and ended the year with million of cash and cash equivalents 
during  we reduced our inventory by million and generated an additional million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in the second quarter 
we used our cash to fully pay down our million credit facility balance from year end and build our cash reserves 
as we have no bond maturities until  we intend to continue to grow our cash balances with cash generated from operations over the next several quarters while  on a very limited basis  acquiring deeply discounted smaller finished lot parcels that represent opportunities to begin immediate construction and generate acceptable margins 
while we believe we have adequate liquidity for  if we continue to experience the declines in operational volumes that have worsened with the current economic recession they may cause us to use our cash reserves to support operations  and at some point we may not have sufficient cash or liquidity under our credit facility 
additionally  if our financial condition deteriorates  we may continue to be challenged to meet our covenants and we may be required to further modify or eliminate the facility and assess the viability of other methods of raising equity and or debt capital 
our goal is to have adequate liquidity during the current market decline and emerge with enough resources to take advantage of opportunities when the market turnaround begins 
there can be no assurances  however  that if needed  we will be able to obtain such modifications or raise such capital on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
unsecured revolving credit facility our credit facility matures in may in july  we amended our credit facility to i eliminate the individual quarterly interest coverage test  ii provide additional cushion by relaxing the minimum interest coverage  maximum leverage and tangible net worth covenants  iii reduce the borrowing capacity to million from million  iv increase the applicable interest rate by up to basis points  v increase the unused commitment fee by basis points depending on the company s leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement  vi modify the advance rates by to for various components and reduce the maximum amounts of certain types of real estate that may be owned at any given time  and vii modify various other terms 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of year end 
the following tables identify certain key debt covenants as of december  under the amended credit facility when interest coverage is maximum leverage ratio x x x x x x x the table below shows the required minimum interest coverage ratio as defined as of the end of each quarter quarter minimum interest coverage ratio q q q q q q q q thereafter if we fail to comply with the minimum interest coverage ratio  we can alternatively comply with a minimum adjusted cash flow ratio or liquidity requirement without breaching our credit agreement 
the adjusted cash flow ratio is defined as i gaap cash flow from operations plus interest incurred to ii interest incurred 
the adjusted cash flow ratio requirement is to 
if we fail to meet the minimum interest coverage ratio and adjusted cash flow 
table of contents requirements  we may alternatively comply with a minimum liquidity requirement of million where the interest coverage ratio is less than to  or million where the interest coverage ratio is more than to 
liquidity is defined as unrestricted cash in excess of million  less any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  plus immediate availability under the facility 
the following table summarizes key covenant thresholds pursuant to the credit facility  as amended by the fourth amendment in july  and our compliance with such covenants as of december  financial covenant covenant requirement actual in millions minimum net worth leverage ratio interest coverage ratio borrowing base debt total land restriction raw land restriction unsold units restriction model homes restriction minimum net worth called actual consolidated tangible net worth in the credit agreement was calculated based on the stated amount of our consolidated equity less intangible assets of million as of december  repayment guarantees are included in the definition of indebtedness for purposes of calculated the leverage ratio 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under the credit facility  and approximately million was outstanding in letters of credit that collateralize our obligations under various land purchase  land development and other contracts 
in addition  we had approximately million in surety and performance bonds outstanding at december   and after considering our most restrictive bank covenants and borrowing base limitations  we had an additional million of our current bank facility available to borrow at that date 
the credit facility includes a commitment reduction provision that is triggered if our stockholders equity falls below million 
in such an event  the total commitment is permanently reduced dollar for dollar by the amount stockholders equity falls below million  up to a maximum commitment reduction of million 
senior subordinated notes in february  we completed a million offering of senior subordinated notes due these notes were issued at par  and their associated proceeds were used to pay down our credit facility 
the covenants related to these senior subordinated notes are substantially similar to the covenants of our senior notes discussed below 
subsequent to year end  we exchanged  shares of our common stock for million of our senior subordinated notes in a privately negotiated transaction 
see additional discussion in note subsequent events to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
senior notes in march  we completed the private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the indenture which governs the senior notes contains covenants that are substantially similar to the covenants in the indenture that governs our existing senior notes discussed below  except that  among other things  the indenture for the senior notes does not require us to maintain a certain level of minimum tangible net worth  provides that the exceptions to the limitation of the amount of additional indebtedness we may acquire with respect to purchase money indebtedness is unlimited  and with respect to other indebtedness is million  provides that the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make is limited to million plus i of net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  increases the amount of investments we can make in joint ventures in a permitted business with unaffiliated 
table of contents third parties to of our consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the indenture  and provides for a suspension of certain covenants if the senior notes have investment grade ratings  as defined in the indenture  including covenants relating to change of control  limitations on additional indebtedness  limitations on the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interest and certain limitations on investments and asset sales 
senior notes in april  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due the indenture for our senior notes requires us to comply with a number of covenants that restrict certain transactions  including covenants limiting the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur unless after giving effect to such additional indebtedness  either i our fixed charge coverage ratio would be at least to or ii our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth would be less than to  provided  however  this limitation does not generally apply to indebtedness under our senior unsecured credit facility  most types of inter company indebtedness  purchase money indebtedness up to million  other indebtedness up to million and non recourse indebtedness  generally limiting the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make to million plus i of our net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  requiring us to maintain tangible net worth of at least million  limiting our ability to incur or create certain liens  and placing limitations on the sale of assets  mergers and consolidations and transactions with affiliates 
if we do not meet both the fixed charge ratio and the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated tangible net worth covenants as defined in our senior and senior subordinated indentures discussed below  we are generally prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness 
our actual fixed charge ratio and ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated tangible net worth as of december  were to and to  respectively 
as of and for the year ended december   we were in compliance with the credit facility and senior and senior subordinated note covenants 
see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for all outstanding balances on our senior and senior subordinated notes 
land option and purchase contracts we enter into various options and purchase contracts for land in the normal course of business 
generally  our options to purchase lots remain effective so long as we purchase a pre established minimum number of lots each month or quarter  as determined by the respective agreement 
the pre established number is typically structured to approximate our expected rate of home construction starts  although as demand slows  in some instances starts may fall below the pre established minimum number of lot purchases 
currently  our slower sales rate is causing us to take certain actions  including purchasing lots in advance of corresponding sales  re negotiating the takedown schedules  and discontinuing lot purchases and forfeiting the related non refundable option deposit 
during  we executed on our goal to reduce lots under control 
the success of this strategy is evidenced by our total ending lot position  with  lots under control at december  as compared to  at december  at december   our total option and purchase contracts had purchase prices in the aggregate of approximately million  on which we had made deposits of approximately million in cash along with approximately million in letters of credit 
during  we also managed our lot takedowns  only acquiring approximately  lots for million under our land option and purchase contracts as compared to approximately  lots for million in  decreases of and  respectively 
additional information regarding our purchase agreements and related deposits is presented in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements reference is made to notes   and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
these notes discuss our off balance sheet arrangements with respect to land acquisition contracts and option agreements  and land development joint ventures  including the nature and amounts of 
table of contents financial obligations relating to these items 
in addition  these notes discuss the nature and amounts of certain types of commitments that arise in connection with the ordinary course of our land development and homebuilding operations  including commitments of land development joint ventures for which we might be obligated 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years principal  senior and senior subordinated notes interest  senior and senior subordinated notes operating lease obligations liabilities related to real estate not owned fin obligations including interest and penalties total see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding our contractual obligations 
we do not engage in commodity trading or other similar activities 
we had no derivative financial instruments at december  or seasonality we typically experience seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirement 
historically  we sell more homes in the first half of the fiscal year than in the second half  which results in increased working capital requirements in the second and third quarters as homes are constructed 
we typically benefit from the cash generated from home closings in the third and fourth quarters 
we expect this seasonal pattern to continue  although it may be affected by the continuing downturn in the homebuilding industry 
recent accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for discussion of recently issued accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates on our existing revolving credit facility 
the interest rate relative to this borrowing fluctuates with the prime and libor lending rates 
at december   we had no outstanding balance drawn under our credit facility that would be subject to changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into  or intend to enter into  derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our fixed rate debt is made up primarily of million in principal of our senior notes  million in principal of our senior notes  and million of our senior subordinated notes 
except in limited circumstances  we do not have an obligation to prepay our fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate borrowings until we would be required to repay such debt 

table of contents the following table presents our long term debt obligations  principal cash flows by maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value 
information regarding interest rate sensitivity principal notional amount by expected maturity and average interest rates for the year ended december  follows december  for the years ended december  fair value at december  thereafter total a dollars in millions fixed rate a average interest rate n a a fair value of our fixed rate debt at december   is derived from quoted market prices by independent dealers 
our operations are interest rate sensitive 
as overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates  a significant increase in mortgage interest rates may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing 
higher interest rates could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and net income and would also increase our variable rate borrowing costs
