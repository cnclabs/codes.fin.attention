item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of the consolidated balance sheets of barnwell industries  inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to herein as barnwell  we  our  us or the company as of september  and  and the related consolidated statements of operations  stockholders equity and comprehensive loss income  and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended september  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management of barnwell to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires the company to make assumptions that are difficult or subjective about matters that were highly uncertain at the time that the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur in periods subsequent to the period in which the estimate was made  or use of different estimates that the company could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations 
the most critical accounting policies inherent in the preparation of the company s financial statements are described below 
we continue to monitor our accounting policies to ensure proper application of current rules and regulations 
oil and natural gas properties full cost ceiling calculation and depletion policy description we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties  under which we are required to conduct quarterly calculations of a ceiling  or limitation on the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties 
the ceiling limitation is the sum of the discounted present value at  using prices as of the end of each reporting period on a constant basis  of barnwell s estimated future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and natural gas reserves  less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves but excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations accrued on the balance sheet  plus the cost of major development projects and unproven properties not subject to depletion  if any  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in costs subject to depletion  less related income tax effects 
if net capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is expensed unless subsequent market price changes eliminate or reduce the indicated write down in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab topic d 

table of contents judgments and assumptions the estimate of our oil and natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  historical data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
our reserve estimates are prepared annually by independent petroleum consultants and quarterly by internal personnel 
the passage of time provides more quantitative and qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
in the past three fiscal years  annual revisions to our reserve volume estimates have averaged of the previous year s estimate 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  such revisions could result in a write down of oil and natural gas properties 
if reported reserve volumes were revised downward by at the end of fiscal  the ceiling limitation would have decreased approximately  this decrease would not have resulted in a write down during the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling  estimated proved reserves are also a significant component of the quarterly calculation of depletion expense 
the lower the estimated reserves  the higher the depletion rate per unit of production 
conversely  the higher the estimated reserves  the lower the depletion rate per unit of production 
if reported reserve volumes were revised downward by as of the beginning of fiscal  depletion for fiscal would have increased by approximately  while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves  and the applicable discount rate  that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the ceiling calculation dictates that a discount factor be used and that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely which results in a value that is not necessarily indicative of the fair market value of the reserves 
therefore  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs 
rather  they are based on such prices and costs in effect as of the end of each period for which the ceiling calculation is performed 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
therefore  oil and natural gas property write downs that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation  and that are caused by fluctuations in prices as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves  should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 
impairment of residential real estate assets and investment in land interests policy description residential real estate assets and investment in land assets are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell 
if an asset s fair value less costs to sell  based on estimated future cash flows  management estimates or market comparisons  is less than its carrying amount  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

table of contents judgments and assumptions residential real estate assets and investment in land assets are reviewed for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows generated by the asset  management estimates or market comparisons are compared with the amount recorded to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset 
if the evaluation determines that the recorded value will not be recovered  the residential real estate assets and land investments are written down to its estimated fair value 
this evaluation requires management to make assumptions and apply considerable judgments to  among others  estimates of the timing and amount of future cash flows  expected useful lives of the assets  uncertainty about future events  including changes in economic conditions  changes in operating performance  changes in the use of the assets  and ongoing cost of maintenance and improvements of the assets 
changes in these and other assumptions may require valuation adjustments that may materially impact the company s financial condition or its future operating results 
impairment of investment in joint ventures policy description joint venture investments are reviewed for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there is an other than temporary loss in value 
an investment is written down to fair value if there is evidence of a loss in value which is other than temporary 
judgments and assumptions the company s investments in joint ventures are reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication of a loss in value 
an investment is written down to fair value if the impairment is other than temporary 
in determining the fair value of an investment and assessing whether any identified impairment is other than temporary  significant estimates and considerable judgment are involved 
in evaluating whether an impairment is other than temporary  the company considers all available information  including the length of time and extent of the impairment  the financial condition and near term prospects of the affiliate  the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  and projected industry and economic trends 
these estimates and judgments are based  in part  on the company s current and future evaluation of economic conditions  as well as a joint venture s current and future plans to the extent that such plans are known to the company 
impairment calculations contain additional uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgments to estimates of future cash flows  probabilities related to various cash flow scenarios  and appropriate discount rates 
changes in these and other assumptions could affect the projected operational results of the unconsolidated affiliates and  accordingly  may require valuation adjustments to the company s investments that may materially impact the company s financial condition or its future operating results 

table of contents income taxes policy description income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax impacts of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
judgments and assumptions we make estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for each reporting period 
significant changes to these estimates could result in an increase or decrease in our tax provision in future periods 
we are also required to make judgments about the recoverability of deferred tax assets and when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is provided 
accordingly  changes in our business performance  unforeseen events  and changes in estimates of future taxable income could require a further increase in the valuation allowance or a reversal in the valuation allowance in future periods 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made  and the impact of these changes could be material 
historically  our current income tax estimates have not materially differed from our income tax returns filed with taxing authorities 
however  there can be no assurance that material differences will not occur in the future 
in addition  barnwell operates within the us and canada and is subject to audit by taxing authorities in these jurisdictions 
barnwell records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits  and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
tax benefits are recognized when we determine that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized 
management evaluates its potential exposures from tax positions taken that have or could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result because taxing authorities may take positions that differ from those taken by management in the interpretation and application of statutes  regulations and rules 
management considers the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon past experience  previous actions by taxing authorities eg  actions taken in other jurisdictions and advice from tax experts 
where uncertainty exists due to the complexity of income tax statutes and where the potential tax amounts are significant  we generally seek independent tax opinions to support our positions 
if our evaluation of the likelihood of the realization of benefits is inaccurate  we could incur additional income tax and interest expense that would adversely impact earnings  or we could receive tax benefits greater than anticipated which would positively impact earnings  either of which could be material 
management believes that barnwell s provision for tax contingencies is reasonable 
however  the ultimate resolution of tax treatments disputed by governmental authorities may adversely affect barnwell s current and deferred income tax amounts 
asset retirement obligation policy description barnwell records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
barnwell s estimated site restoration and abandonment costs of its oil and natural gas properties are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of oil and natural gas properties and depleted over the life of the related reserves 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to oil and natural gas operating expense 

table of contents judgments and assumptions the asset retirement obligation is recorded at fair value in the period in which it is incurred along with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset 
barnwell has estimated fair value by discounting the estimated future cash outflows required to settle abandonment and restoration liabilities 
the present value calculation includes numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding the existence of liabilities  the amount and timing of cash outflows required to settle the liability  what constitutes adequate restoration  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  and consideration of changes in legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
abandonment and restoration cost estimates are determined in conjunction with barnwell s reserve engineers based on historical information regarding costs incurred to abandon and restore similar well sites  information regarding current market conditions and costs  and knowledge of subject well sites and properties 
the process of estimating the asset retirement obligation requires substantial judgment and use of estimates  resulting in imprecise determinations 
actual asset retirement obligations through the end of fiscal have not materially differed from our estimates 
however  because of the inherent imprecision of estimates as described above  there can be no assurance that material differences will not occur in the future 
a increase in accretion and depletion related to the asset retirement obligation would have increased barnwell s fiscal expenses before taxes by approximately  contractual obligations disclosure is not required as barnwell qualifies as a smaller reporting company 
overview barnwell is engaged in the following lines of business exploring for  developing  producing and selling oil and natural gas in canada oil and natural gas segment  investing in leasehold land and other real estate interests in hawaii land investment segment  acquiring property for investment and development of homes for sale in hawaii residential real estate segment  and drilling wells and installing and repairing water pumping systems in hawaii contract drilling segment 
oil and natural gas segment barnwell sells substantially all of its oil and natural gas liquids production under short term contracts with marketers of oil 
natural gas sold by barnwell is generally sold under both long term and short term contracts with prices indexed to market prices 
the price of natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids is freely negotiated between the buyers and sellers 
oil and natural gas prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control 
market prices for petroleum products are dependent upon factors such as  but not limited to  changes in market supply and demand  which are impacted by overall economic activity  changes in weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  and output 
petroleum and natural gas prices are very difficult to predict and fluctuate significantly 
natural gas prices tend to be higher in the winter than in the summer due to increased demand  although this trend has become less pronounced due to the increased use of natural gas to generate electricity for air conditioning in the summer and increased natural gas storage capacity in north america 

table of contents oil and natural gas exploration  development and operating costs generally follow trends in product market prices  thus in times of higher product prices the cost of exploration  development and operation of oil and natural gas properties will tend to escalate as well 
barnwell s oil and natural gas operations make capital expenditures in the exploration  development  and production of oil and natural gas 
cash outlays for capital expenditures are largely discretionary  however  a minimum level of capital expenditures is required to replace depleting reserves 
due to the nature of oil and natural gas exploration and development  significant uncertainty exists as to the ultimate success of any drilling effort 
land investment segment barnwell owns a controlling interest in kaupulehu developments  a hawaii general partnership which owns interests in leasehold land and development rights for property located approximately six miles north of the kona international airport in the north kona district of the island of hawaii  within and adjacent to hualalai resort at historic ka upulehu  between the queen kaahumanu highway and the pacific ocean 
a former director of barnwell and minority interest owner in certain of barnwell s business ventures and his affiliated entities indirectly own of kaupulehu developments 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion on related party interests 
kaupulehu developments interests include the following development rights for residentially zoned leasehold land within and adjacent to the hualalai golf club which are under option to a developer 
as of september   the development rights are under option for  comprised of two payments of  due on december  and december  the right to receive payments resulting from the sale of lots and or residential units within approximately acres in the kaupulehu area by third party developers 
approximately  acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation in the kaupulehu area located adjacent to the acres described above 
kaupulehu developments has an agreement which provides a potential developer with the exclusive right to negotiate with kaupulehu developments with respect to these  acres 
this right expires in june or  in june if the developer has not completed all environmental assessments and surveys reasonably required to support a petition to the hawaii state land use commission for reclassification of the  acres 
kaupulehu mauka investors  llc  a limited liability company wholly owned by barnwell  holds lot acquisition rights as to lots within approximately  acres of agricultural zoned leasehold land in the upland area of kaupulehu mauka lands situated between the queen kaahumanu highway and the mamalahoa highway at kaupulehu  north kona  island and state of hawaii 
the lot acquisition rights give barnwell the right to acquire residential lots  each of 
table of contents which is currently estimated to be two to five acres in size  which may be developed on the mauka lands 
these lands are currently classified as agricultural by the state of hawaii and  accordingly  the developer of these lands will need to pursue both state and county of hawaii approvals for reclassification and rezoning to permit a residential subdivision and negotiate development terms 
residential real estate segment barnwell owns an controlling interest in kaupulehu  lllp kaupulehu  a hawaii limited liability limited partnership  which acquires house lots for investment and constructs luxury single family homes for future sale 
a former director of barnwell and minority interest owner in certain of barnwell s business ventures and his affiliates have a interest in kaupulehu refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion on related party interests 
contract drilling segment barnwell drills water  water monitoring and geothermal wells and installs and repairs water pumping systems in hawaii 
contract drilling results are highly dependent upon the quantity  dollar value and timing of contracts awarded by governmental and private entities and can fluctuate significantly 
investment in joint ventures barnwell owns an interest in kaupulehu investors  llc  which owns passive minority interests in three joint ventures  hualalai investors jv  llc and hualalai investors ii  llc hereinafter collectively referred to as hualalai investors  which own hualalai resort  and kona village investors  llc  which owns kona village resort

refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion on related party interests 
business environment our primary operations are concentrated in the state of hawaii and in canada 
accordingly  our business performance is directly affected by macroeconomic conditions in those areas  as well as general economic conditions of the us domestic and world economies 
widespread national and international concern over instability in the credit and capital markets continued during recent months with unprecedented market volatility and disruption in the us and world economies 
the current recession that we are now experiencing differentiates recent months from years past with higher unemployment levels  collapses and government bail outs of financial institutions  deterioration in consumer confidence  and reduced consumer spending 
all of the company s business segments have been adversely impacted by these changes 
according to the state of hawaii department of business  economic development and tourism s dbedt th quarter quarterly statistical economic report  hawaii s economy continued to slow through the third calendar quarter of  primarily due to weak national and local economic conditions and continued declines in visitor spending 
dbedt expects that the remainder of calendar year will bring reduced visitor spending  increased unemployment rates  and slower construction activity 
the aforementioned factors have had  and will presumably continue to have  an unfavorable impact on barnwell s hawaii operations into fiscal 
table of contents to combat the tough economic conditions  the company has implemented cost containment programs including reductions in capital expenditures  management and staff compensation costs  and other general and administrative expenditures 
oil and natural gas segment our revenue  profitability  and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on existing oil and natural gas prices 
historically  oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile 
oil and natural gas prices hit historic high levels in fiscal through the date of this filing  oil and natural gas prices have fallen sharply from their record levels 
natural gas prices for barnwell  based on quarterly averages during the three years ended september   have ranged from a low of per thousand cubic feet the average price for the quarter ended september  to a high of per thousand cubic feet the average price for the quarter ended june  
oil prices for barnwell  based on quarterly averages for the period discussed above  ranged from a low of per barrel the average price for the quarter ended march  to a high of per barrel the average price for the quarter ended june  
although oil prices have increased from march levels  natural gas prices have continued to be weak during the three months ended september  and into fiscal continued or extended declines in prices for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and cash flows 
in response to the significant declines in oil and natural gas prices and general economic conditions  the company has significantly reduced oil and natural gas capital expenditures and expects to hold such capital expenditures at reduced levels into fiscal reduced capital expenditures  if significant and or continued  will likely result in a reduction in reserve volumes and oil and natural gas production 
land investment and residential real estate segments in prior years  hawaii s economy experienced positive growth and the south kohala north kona area of the island of hawaii  the area in which kaupulehu developments leasehold interests are located and kaupulehu is building homes  experienced strong demand for high end residential real estate 
however  beginning in fiscal and throughout fiscal  the economic recession caused sales prices and activity within the kaupulehu area to be significantly lower than original expectations 
due to sharp declines in demand for luxury real estate  we expect revenues from real estate sales through fiscal to be lower than in previous years 
this could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition  and liquidity and cash flows 
the value of the company s lot acquisition rights in the mauka lands is also impacted by development activity and real estate values in the surrounding area 
during fiscal  as a result of protracted widespread impacts of the economic recession and tightened credit markets on the real estate industry  it was determined that a decline in the value of the company s lot acquisition rights within the mauka lands to below its carrying value existed 
accordingly  the company reduced the carrying value of its lot acquisition rights in the mauka lands by  during the year ended september  continued weak real estate sales activity could result in additional write downs of our investment in lot acquisition rights in the mauka lands 

table of contents kaupulehu s two luxury homes are complete and available for sale 
our ability to sell the completed residences and or lots held for investment is contingent upon the strength of the luxury real estate market 
because of the economic recession we are currently facing  it may take an extended period of time to sell the homes and or lots and sales prices could be lower than our current estimates 
barnwell will have cash outflows such as interest  maintenance  property taxes  and other holding costs until the homes and lots are sold 
barnwell s  real estate revolving credit facility expires in december if the economy remains weak or worsens and we are unable to sell the homes and or lots by the time the facility becomes due  it is possible that we will be unable to meet our debt obligations 
if that is the case  we will be required to refinance the debt  secure alternative financing  reduce fiscal oil and natural gas capital expenditures  liquidate assets  or take other necessary actions in order to make any required repayments 
such actions could have negative impacts on our operations and financial condition 
contract drilling segment demand for water well drilling and or pump installation services is volatile and dependent upon land development activities within the state of hawaii 
according to the dbedt th quarter quarterly statistical economic report  substantial declines in the number of construction jobs  value of private building authorizations  value of government contracts awarded  and median sales prices for both single family homes and condominiums during the first three calendar quarters of indicate slower construction activity in the near future 
investment in joint ventures hawaii s real gdp is projected to decline percent in calendar year this is highlighted by such factors as reduced visitor counts and spending  increased unemployment rates  and slower construction activity 
according to dbedt s th quarter quarterly statistical economic report  tourism activity in hawaii declined sharply during the first three quarters of calendar year as compared to the first three quarters of calendar year both the number of visitor arrivals and hotel occupancy rates were down 
visitor arrivals  visitor days and visitor spending are forecasted to decline through the remainder of calendar year in addition  beginning in fiscal and throughout fiscal  the economic recession caused real estate sales within the hualalai resort area to be lower than original expectations 
during the year ended september   as a result of protracted widespread impacts of the economic recession and tightened credit markets on the real estate and hotel industries  the company reduced the carrying value of its joint venture investments by  further deterioration of these conditions and continued reduced tourism and real estate sales activity could result in a sustained decrease in the value of our investment in these joint ventures  which may require us to record additional write downs of these investments 

table of contents results of operations summary in fiscal  barnwell recorded a non cash reduction of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties of  approximately  net of income taxes 
the reduction was primarily due to a significant decline in petroleum prices 
under the full cost method of accounting  prices as of the end of the quarter are used to determine the maximum carrying value of oil and natural gas properties 
the full cost method assumes constant prices over the productive life of the underlying oil and natural gas reserves  and its results do not necessarily reflect the true fair value of the underlying reserves as commodity prices are volatile and subject to changes in economic conditions and market forces over time 
changes in oil and natural gas prices  as well as changes in production rates  levels of reserves  future development costs and the market value of unproved properties  impact the determination of the maximum carrying value of oil and natural gas properties 
future declines in oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices may result in additional reductions in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties in the absence of offsetting changes 
barnwell reported a net loss of  in fiscal  a  decrease from net earnings of  in fiscal this decrease was largely due to the following items the aforementioned non cash reduction of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties of  approximately  net of income taxes as well as  in non cash reductions of the carrying values of barnwell s investments in joint ventures and lot acquisition rights approximately  net of minority interest and income taxes  decrease of  before taxes in oil and natural gas segment operating profit excluding the impact of the reduction in carrying value of oil and natural gas properties discussed above  due primarily to lower prices received for all petroleum products  decreased land investment segment operating profits before income taxes of  due to decreased receipts of development rights option payments and percentage of sales payments  a  non cash charge to deferred income tax expense in fiscal resulting from an increase in the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets  there was no such income tax charge in fiscal  and fiscal earnings included a deferred income tax benefit of  resulting from a decrease in canadian federal income tax rates  there was no such benefit in fiscal the aforementioned items were partially offset by a  decrease  before income taxes  in general and administrative expenses 

table of contents barnwell generated net earnings of  in fiscal  an  increase from net earnings of  in fiscal this increase was largely due to a  increase in operating profits before income taxes  primarily due to higher prices received for all petroleum products  partially offset by a  increase  before income taxes  in general and administrative expenses net of minority interest  and bad debt expense of  before income taxes  principally related to oil and natural gas segment receivables 
the increase was further attributable to a deferred income tax benefit in fiscal of  resulting from a decrease in canadian federal income tax rates as compared to a benefit of  in fiscal general in addition to us operations  barnwell conducts foreign operations in canada 
consequently  barnwell is subject to foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses due to fluctuations of the exchange rates between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
the fiscal year average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar decreased at september   as compared to september  accordingly  the assets  liabilities  stockholders equity and revenues and expenses of barnwell s subsidiaries operating in canada have been adjusted to reflect the change in the exchange rates 
barnwell s canadian dollar assets are greater than its canadian dollar liabilities  therefore  increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar to the us dollar generate other comprehensive income or losses  respectively 
the fiscal year average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar decreased at september   as compared to september  other comprehensive income and losses are not included in net loss earnings 
the other comprehensive loss due to foreign currency translation adjustments  net of taxes  for fiscal was  a  decrease from other comprehensive loss due to foreign currency translation adjustments  net of taxes  of  in fiscal foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material in fiscal  and and are reflected in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the impact of fluctuations of the exchange rates between the canadian dollar and the us dollar may be material from period to period 
barnwell cannot accurately predict future fluctuations between canadian and us dollars

oil and natural gas operating expenses operating expenses decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal primarily due to a decrease in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar that decreased oil and natural gas operating expenses  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was partially offset by higher utility costs and higher than usual workover activity which resulted in higher repairs and maintenance costs 
operating expenses increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal primarily due to a increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar that increased oil and natural gas operating expenses  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was partially offset by lower workover activity and repairs at certain older properties

table of contents contract drilling revenues decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  and contract drilling operating expenses decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the contract drilling segment generated a  operating profit before general and administrative expenses during fiscal  a decrease of  as compared to an operating profit before general and administrative expenses of  in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to decreased well drilling activity during fiscal as compared to fiscal at september   there was a backlog of six well drilling contracts and four pump installation and repair contracts  of which three well drilling and three pump installation and repair contracts were in progress as of september  the backlog of contract drilling revenues as of november  was approximately  all of the contracts in backlog at november  are expected to be completed within fiscal year contract drilling revenues increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  and contract drilling operating expenses increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the contract drilling segment generated a  operating profit before general and administrative expenses during fiscal  an increase of  as compared to an operating profit before general and administrative expenses of  in fiscal the increase is primarily due to increases in well drilling and pump installation activity  higher values and margins of contracts performed in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and lower well drilling operating profit in fiscal due to higher drilling costs incurred on contracts performed 
contract drilling revenues and costs are not seasonal in nature but can fluctuate significantly based on the awarding and timing of contracts  which are determined by contract drilling customer demand 
gas processing and other income gas processing and other income decreased  to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the fiscal period included gains of  from the sale of lot purchase rights by the residential real estate segment see further discussion in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item and  which represented insurance proceeds received on the involuntary conversion of an incapacitated drill rig that had been fully depreciated  no such revenues were received during fiscal gas processing and other income increased  to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the increase is primarily due to the aforementioned fiscal gains of  from the sale of lot purchase rights and  in insurance proceeds received 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to i a  decrease in current compensation costs due to reductions in compensation for both management and staff  ii a  decrease in professional services  iii a  decrease due to a decrease in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar  and iv a  decrease in travel and entertainment costs 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to i a  increase in current compensation costs  ii a  increase in professional services  primarily due to regulatory compliance efforts  and iii a  increase due to increases in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar 
bad debt expense bad debt expense decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to lower bad debt provisions recorded during fiscal  as well as the recovery of  of previously reserved receivables in fiscal no bad debt reserves were recorded during fiscal depletion  depreciation and amortization depletion  depreciation and amortization decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  due to a decrease in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar coupled with a decrease in the depletion rate due to the reduction of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties during fiscal depletion  depreciation and amortization increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  due to a increase in the depletion rate due to increases in barnwell s costs of finding and developing proven reserves and a increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in production 
barnwell s costs of finding and developing proven reserves increased due to the costs of oil and natural gas exploration and development having increased along with product prices and the drilling of unsuccessful wells 
reduction of carrying value of assets during fiscal  barnwell reduced the carrying value of certain assets 
a breakdown of the reduction of the carrying value of assets as reported in the consolidated statements of operations is as follows year ended september  oil and natural gas properties investment in joint ventures lot acquisition rights mauka lands total reduction of carrying value of assets under the full cost method of accounting  we are required to perform quarterly ceiling test calculations 
due to a significant decline in prices  barnwell s net capitalized costs exceeded the ceiling limitation at the end of the second and third quarters of fiscal as such  barnwell reduced the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties by  during the year ended september  no such reduction was recorded during fiscal years or 
table of contents under the full cost method of accounting  prices as of the end of the quarter are used to determine the maximum carrying value of oil and natural gas properties 
the full cost method assumes constant prices over the productive life of the underlying oil and natural gas reserves  and its results do not necessarily reflect the true fair value of the underlying reserves as commodity prices are volatile and subject to changes in economic conditions and market forces over time 
changes in oil and natural gas prices  as well as changes in production rates  levels of reserves  future development costs and the market value of unproved properties  impact the determination of the maximum carrying value of oil and natural gas properties 
future declines in oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices may result in additional reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties in the absence of offsetting changes 
as a result of protracted widespread impacts of the economic recession and tightened credit markets on the real estate and hotel industries  barnwell recorded a  non cash reduction in the carrying value of its investment in joint ventures during the year ended september   due to declines in values that are deemed other than temporary 
no such reduction was recorded during fiscal years or a market value approach was utilized to determine the other than temporary fair value of barnwell s investment in joint ventures  based on estimates of the aforementioned impacts on the value of the underlying assets of the joint ventures 
as a result of protracted widespread impacts of the economic recession and tightened credit markets on the real estate industry  during the year ended september   barnwell determined that a reduction of the carrying value of its lot acquisition rights in the mauka lands was necessary as a result of the aforementioned impacts on real estate in the area in which barnwell holds interests 
accordingly  barnwell reduced the carrying value of its investment in lot acquisition rights by  no such reduction was recorded during fiscal years or a discounted cash flow valuation approach was utilized to determine the fair value of the lot acquisition rights based on estimates of discounted market values of the lots to be developed in the future  as adjusted for land use zoning and development probabilities 
interest expense interest expense decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  primarily due to lower average interest rates  partially offset by higher average loan balances  during fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was also partially offset by a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized due to the completion of the development of residential homes during fiscal the weighted average balance of outstanding borrowings from royal bank of canada increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the average interest rate incurred on barnwell s borrowings from royal bank of canada decreased to in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the weighted average balance of outstanding borrowings under the real estate credit facility increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the average interest rate incurred on borrowings on the real estate credit facility decreased to in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal of the interest amounts incurred   was capitalized in fiscal as compared to  during fiscal 
table of contents interest expense increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  due to higher average loan balances  partially offset by lower average interest rates during fiscal as compared to fiscal the weighted average balance of outstanding borrowings from royal bank of canada increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the average interest rate incurred during fiscal on barnwell s borrowings from royal bank of canada decreased to  as compared to in fiscal the weighted average balance of outstanding borrowings under the real estate credit facility increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the average interest rate incurred during fiscal from borrowings on the real estate credit facility decreased to  as compared to in fiscal of the interest amounts incurred   was capitalized in fiscal as compared to  during fiscal interest costs for the fiscal years ended september   and are summarized as follows year ended september  interest costs incurred less interest costs capitalized interest expense the majority of barnwell s debt is denominated in us dollars 
therefore  the decrease in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar had a minimal impact on interest expense 
income taxes barnwell s effective consolidated income tax benefit rate for fiscal was approximately 
this rate is lower than the expected statutory us rate of due primarily to a  non cash charge to income tax expense resulting from an increase in the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets due to recent events regarding real estate in the area in which barnwell holds interests that impacted management s projections of future income levels necessary to benefit from such deferred tax assets 
included in the income tax provision for fiscal is a  reduction of the net deferred tax liability due to a reduction in canadian federal tax rates 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the canadian government enacted reductions in the corporate tax rate from    and in calendar years    and  respectively  to    and  respectively 
a minor reduction in canadian federal tax rates in fiscal resulted in a  reduction in net deferred tax liabilities in fiscal barnwell s effective consolidated income tax rate for the year ended september   excluding the aforementioned  impact of the reduction in canadian income tax rates  was approximately  and the effective consolidated income tax rate for the year ended september  was approximately 
environmental matters federal  state  and canadian governmental agencies issue rules and regulations and enforce laws to protect the environment which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply  particularly in regard to the discharge of materials into the environment 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business 
these laws  rules and regulations affect the operations of barnwell and could have a material adverse effect upon the earnings or competitive position of barnwell 
although barnwell s experience has been to the contrary  there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case 

table of contents inflation the effect of inflation on barnwell has generally been to increase its cost of operations  interest cost as a substantial portion of barnwell s debt is at variable short term rates of interest which tend to increase as inflation increases  general and administrative costs and direct costs associated with oil and natural gas production and contract drilling operations 
oil and natural gas prices realized by barnwell are essentially determined by world prices for oil and western canadian midwestern us prices for natural gas 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb updated fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  formerly fsp fas 
fasb asc section defers the effective date of fasb asc topic to fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we have elected to utilize this deferral and accordingly  we will apply fasb asc topic to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the quarter ending december  barnwell is currently evaluating the impact that the application of fasb asc topic to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis will have on its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in december  the fasb updated fasb asc subtopic  consolidation  formerly sfas no 

fasb asc subtopic establishes accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interest in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified and presented in the consolidated balance sheets within equity  but separate from the parent s equity  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statements of operations  and changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently 
this statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  upon adoption  there will be no material impact on barnwell s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb updated fasb asc topic  compensation retirement benefits  formerly fsp fas r 
fasb asc topic provides additional guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan 
fasb asc topic is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after december  barnwell s management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these provisions on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the sec adopted revisions to its required oil and natural gas reporting disclosures 
additionally  in october  the sec issued sab no 
 which revises or rescinds portions of the interpretive guidance of its oil and natural gas rules 
the revisions are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and natural gas 
table of contents reserves 
in the three decades that have passed since adoption of the original disclosure requirements  there have been significant changes in the oil and natural gas industry 
the amendments are designed to modernize and update the oil and natural gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology 
in addition  the amendments concurrently align the sec s full cost accounting rules with the revised disclosures 
the revised disclosure requirements must be incorporated in annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december  a company may not apply the new rules to disclosures in quarterly reports prior to the first annual report in which the revised disclosures are required 
barnwell s management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these provisions on the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources barnwell s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flows from operations  land investment segment proceeds and borrowings on its credit facilities 
at september   barnwell had  in cash and cash equivalents and approximately  of available credit under its credit facility with its canadian bank 
as of september   barnwell had borrowed the maximum amount available under its credit facility with a hawaii bank  which is restricted in its use to the construction of homes and financing of lots by kaupulehu at september   we maintained positive working capital of  as compared to positive working capital of  at september  barnwell s future liquidity and ability to fund capital expenditures is dependent upon operating cash flows  existing working capital  available credit under its credit facility with its canadian bank  and ability to access debt and equity markets 
we believe our current cash balances  future operating cash flows  land investment segment proceeds  residential home and lot sales  and available credit will be sufficient to fund our operations  planned future capital expenditures  scheduled debt repayments and related interest  and settle incentive compensation liabilities in cash  if necessary 
however  over the last year  the us and international credit markets have experienced significant disruption 
although some recovery has occurred in the credit markets in recent months  these disruptions have resulted in greater volatility  less liquidity  and limited availability of financing 
therefore we cannot predict whether barnwell s canadian revolving credit facility will be reduced below the current level of borrowings under the facility because of significant decreases in the rate of exchange of the canadian dollar to the us dollar or upon the april review 
furthermore  we cannot predict whether our real estate revolving credit facility s loan advance limitation will be reduced below borrowed amounts due to a decrease in appraised values of the underlying security  which would require us to repay a portion of our loan borrowings  or whether the homes and residential lots will be sold before december   the facility s expiration date 
events and circumstances that lead to results that significantly differ from management s expectations could have a material adverse effect on our operations  liquidity  cash flows  and financial condition 
oil and natural gas prices  land investment segment proceeds  and residential real estate home and lot sales are driven by market supply and demand factors which are impacted by the overall state of the economy 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile and the timing and amount of land investment segment proceeds are unpredictable  sporadic  and not under barnwell s control 
development rights proceeds  on the other hand  are scheduled  but there is no assurance that future monies will be received 
if oil and natural gas prices continue to decline and land investment segment proceeds and residential real estate home and lot sales are less than current expectations  we will be faced with reduced operating cash flows which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our 
table of contents operations  liquidity  cash flows  and financial condition 
in response to significant declines in oil and natural gas prices and land investment segment proceeds and resulting decreases in cash inflows  the company significantly reduced oil and natural gas capital expenditures in fiscal and is holding such capital expenditures at reduced levels through at least the first half of fiscal in the event a reduction in capital expenditures is not sufficient to fund our future cash needs  we will need to obtain alternative terms or sources of financing or liquidate investments and or operating assets to make any required cash outflows 
reduced oil and natural gas capital expenditures  if significant and or continued  will likely result in a reduction in future oil and natural gas reserve volumes and production 
cash flows cash flows used in operations totaled  for fiscal  as compared to  of cash flows provided by operations for the same period in fiscal the  decrease in cash flows was primarily due to a decrease in operating profit generated by barnwell s oil and natural gas segment resulting from declines in the market prices for oil and natural gas during fiscal  an increase in residential real estate home development costs  and changes in working capital primarily due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of payments of accrued taxes and accrued bonuses in fiscal as compared to the same period in fiscal net cash used in investing activities totaled  for fiscal  as compared to  for fiscal the decrease in net cash used was primarily attributable to reduced capital expenditures  offset in part by decreased proceeds from land investment segment sales  during fiscal  as compared to the same period in fiscal cash flows provided by financing activities totaled  for fiscal  as compared to  of cash flows used in financing activities for fiscal this increase in cash inflows was primarily due to increased long term debt borrowings in hawaii related to the residences under construction and reduced barnwell stock repurchases and dividend payments in fiscal as compared to fiscal residential real estate capitalized costs construction of two luxury residences commenced in january and as of september   both homes are complete and available for sale 
capitalized expenditures related to construction of the two residences  including accrued construction costs and capitalized interest  totaled  for the year ended september  the first home  on lot  was completed and listed for sale at an offering price of  in june the home is a fully furnished bedroom  bath ranch style home with a th bedroom that can also be used as an office 
the home is  square feet in size 
it is designed with an open air breezeway connecting the bedroom main house with a separate or bedroom guest quarters  creating privacy for both living areas 
the second home  on lot  was recently completed and is anticipated to be listed for sale at a similar price 
this home is planned to be sold unfurnished 
it is of similar design to the lot home and is  square feet in size 

table of contents oil and natural gas capital expenditures barnwell s oil and natural gas capital expenditures  including accrued capital expenditures  decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to sharp declines in oil and natural gas prices  spending for fiscal was significantly reduced from previous estimates 
during the year ended september   barnwell participated in drilling gross net wells  of which gross net wells appear to be successful or are currently being evaluated and gross net wells were not successful 
including revisions of previous estimates  barnwell replaced of oil production including natural gas liquids and of natural gas production during fiscal  as compared to and  respectively  during fiscal excluding revisions of previous estimates  barnwell replaced of oil production including natural gas liquids and of natural gas production during fiscal  as compared to and  respectively  during fiscal of the gross wells drilled in fiscal  barnwell initiated gross net wells 
the term gross refers to the total number of wells in which barnwell owns an interest  and net refers to barnwell s aggregate interest therein 
for example  a interest in a well represents gross well  but net well 
the gross figure includes interests owned of record by barnwell and  in addition  the portion owned by others 
of the  total oil and natural gas properties investments for fiscal   was for acquisition of oil and natural gas properties   was for exploration costs   was for development of oil and natural gas properties  and  was for support equipment and facilities 
the following table sets forth the gross and net numbers of oil and natural gas wells barnwell participated in drilling for each of the last three fiscal years gross net gross net gross net exploratory oil and natural gas wells development oil and natural gas wells successful oil and natural gas wells unsuccessful oil and natural gas wells barnwell estimates that oil and natural gas capital expenditures for fiscal will range from  to  this estimated amount will decrease or increase as dictated by cash flows generated by operations and management s assessment of the oil and natural gas environment and prospects 
the company is currently unable to estimate when it will increase its oil and natural gas exploration and development activity as such a determination will depend upon future oil and natural gas prices and a strengthening of general economic conditions 
reduced capital expenditures  if significant and or continued  will likely result in a reduction in reserve volumes and oil and natural gas production 
credit arrangements barnwell s credit facility at royal bank of canada  a canadian bank  was renewed in april for  canadian dollars  unchanged from the prior year amount  or approximately us  at the september  exchange rate

both of the homes are complete and available for sale 
the real estate revolving credit facility pertaining to the homes and lots held for investment is due on december  we cannot predict whether our real estate revolving credit facility s loan advance limitation will be reduced below borrowed amounts due to a decrease in appraised values of the underlying security  or whether the homes and residential lots will be sold before the facility s expiration date 
if barnwell is unable to sell the homes and lots held for investment within a reasonable timeframe  barnwell will be required to refinance the debt  secure alternative financing  reduce fiscal oil and natural gas capital expenditures  liquidate assets  or take other necessary actions in order to make any required repayments 
in addition  barnwell will have cash outflows such as interest  maintenance  property taxes  and other holding costs until the homes and lots are sold
