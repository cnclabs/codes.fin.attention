overview we are a specialized asset management company that uses industry specific expertise to evaluate  originate  service and manage investment opportunities in the commercial finance  real estate and financial fund management sectors 
as a specialized asset manager  we seek to develop investment funds for outside investors for which we provide asset management services  typically under long term management arrangements either through a contract with  or as the manager or general partner of  our sponsored investment funds 
we typically maintain an investment in the funds we sponsor 
assets under management have grown from billion at september  to billion at september  we limit our fund development and management services to asset classes in which we have specific expertise 
we believe this strategy enhances the return on investment we can achieve for our funds 
in our commercial finance operations  we focus on originating small and middle ticket equipment leases and commercial loans secured by business essential equipment  including technology  commercial and industrial equipment and medical equipment 
in our real estate operations  we concentrate on the ownership  operation and management of multifamily and commercial real estate and real estate mortgage loans including whole mortgage loans  first priority interests in commercial mortgage loans  known as a notes  subordinated interests in first mortgage loans  known as b notes  mezzanine loans and investments in discounted and distressed real estate and real estate related debt 
in our financial fund management operations  we concentrate on trust preferred securities of banks  bank holding companies  insurance companies and other financial companies  bank loans and asset backed securities  or abs 
as a specialized asset manager  we are affected by conditions in the financial markets and  in particular  have been affected by the recent volatility and reduction in liquidity in the global credit markets which have reduced the revenues from  and the values of  many of the types of financial assets which we manage or own 
these conditions resulted in our recording the following charges during fiscal a million charge  net of tax  from the sale of our interest in apidos cdo vi  a million charge  net of minority interest and tax  to reflect the other than temporary impairment of certain investments in cdo issuers with investments in bank loans million  including million in europe and financial institutions  a million provision for credit losses  net of tax  which impacted our business segments as follows commercial finance million  real estate  and financial fund management million  and a million charge  net of tax  to reflect our equity losses in the unrealized depreciation in the book value of securities held by our investment entities 
principally  as a result of these charges  we recorded a net loss of million in fiscal as compared to a net loss of million for fiscal and net income of million for fiscal assets under management we decreased our assets under management by billion to billion at september  from billion at september  the following table sets forth information relating to our assets under management by operating segment in millions september  decrease amount percentage financial fund management real estate commercial finance for information on how we calculate assets under management  see item  business assets under management

the revenues in each of our operating segments are generated by the fees we earn for structuring and managing the investment entities we sponsored on behalf of individual and institutional investors and rcc  and the income produced by the assets and investments we manage for our own account

we provide a more detailed discussion of the revenues generated by each of our business segments under results of operations commercial finance  real estate and financial fund management 
results of operations commercial finance during fiscal  our commercial finance assets under management decreased million to billion as compared to billion in fiscal because the amortization and repayment of existing commercial finance assets exceeded new originations 
our originations of new equipment financing decreased by million to million in fiscal from billion in fiscal originations in fiscal included million related to our november acquisitions of the dolphin capital corp 
and netbank portfolios of leases and loans 
excluding these acquisitions  originations decreased by million for fiscal as compared to fiscal our originations have been and we expect they will continue to be impacted by the state of the credit markets and the ability of our funds to maintain and obtain financing to acquire portfolios of leases and loans from us 
subsequent to the acquisitions made in fiscal and the acquisition of the leasing division of pacific capital bank at the end of fiscal  we embarked on converting the systems and processes of the acquired entities onto the leaf platform 
these conversion efforts were substantially completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we focused our efforts on improving our financial condition by selling investments and reducing our costs by eliminating operating redundancies following conversion of the fiscal acquisitions and to reduce our staff in light of reduced origination capabilities brought on by the recession and tight debt markets 

back to index 
back to index in march  two public equipment leasing partnerships we sponsored and manage formed a joint venture 
the joint venture subsequently acquired a portion of our interest in leaf commercial finance fund  llc  or lcff  an investment fund we formed to acquire and finance leases and loans we originate 
as a result of the transaction  lcff became a vie for which the joint venture was determined to be the primary beneficiary and  therefore  we ceased to consolidate lcff as of march  accordingly  a total of million of commercial finance assets and million of debt financing were transferred to the joint venture and removed from our financial statements 
as a result of this transaction and the deleveraging and due to the reduction in our warehouse borrowings  the commercial finance assets we managed for our own account for fiscal decreased million to million as compared to million for fiscal the billion in assets we managed for others has remained the same level for fiscal and in august  we commenced a public offering of limited partnership interests in a new investment entity that commenced operations in september this offering was closed to new investors on october  having raised million 
in addition  through february  we raised million from the issuance of lcff subordinated notes 
as of september   we managed approximately  leases and loans that had an average original finance value of  with an original average term of months 
as of september   we managed approximately  leases and loans that had an average original finance value of  with an original average term of months 
the following table sets forth information related to commercial finance assets we manage in millions september  leaf lcff merit managed for our own account leaf investment entities rcc other managed for others for information on how we calculate assets under management  see item  business assets under management 
as of march   lcff is no longer a consolidated entity  and at september  is included in assets managed for our investment entities 
the revenues from our commercial finance operations consist primarily of finance revenues from leases and loans held by us prior to being sold to our investment entities  acquisition fees which we earn when we sell commercial finance assets to one of our investment entities  and asset management fees earned over the life of the lease or loan after we sell it 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the revenues recognized and costs and expenses incurred in our commercial finance operations in thousands years ended september  revenues finance revenues acquisition fees fund management fees other costs and expenses wages and benefit costs other costs and expenses total revenues include rcc servicing and origination fees of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 

back to index 
back to index revenues fiscal compared to fiscal revenues decreased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal we attribute these decreases primarily to the following a million decrease in commercial finance revenues 
in fiscal  we held a significantly higher portfolio balance of leases and loans as a result of the million netbank portfolio acquired in november and held by us until being completely sold in april in addition  as of march  we no longer consolidated lcff  a million portfolio 
as a result of these transactions  our finance revenues decreased significantly  however  since these assets are now owned by our investment funds  we are earning ongoing asset management fees 
our warehouse line of credit that allows us to originate and hold equipment financings prior to selling them to our investment entities was extended until january   but at a lower borrowing limit of million previously million 
this will require us to reduce the size of the portfolio we can hold on our balance sheet  which accordingly  will decrease of our future commercial finance revenues  a million decrease in acquisition fees resulting from the billion decrease in the amount of leases sold to our funds and rcc to million 
this decrease reflects the portfolio acquisitions we sold to our investment entities in fiscal additionally  the difficulty in obtaining debt financing by our investment funds has limited their ability to acquire equipment financings from us 
consequently  we have reduced our commercial finance originations to match the asset acquisition capabilities of our funds  an  increase in fund management fees 
our management fees include fees we receive to service the commercial finance assets we manage  offering fees earned for raising capital in our investment entities as well as fees received for originating loans for those entities 
during fiscal  management fees earned to service leases increased by  due to the growth in assets under management created by the billion of lease originations in fiscal these increases were offset  in part  by decreased offering fees of  related to the time between the closing of one fund and the opening of another investment fund 
in addition  during fiscal  we waived  of fund management fees in one of our investment entities as payment of such fees is contingent upon providing a certain annual distribution rate to the investment entity s partners  which was not met and is uncertain for future periods  and a million decrease in other income  primarily reflecting reduced gains on equipment finance dispositions and late fees derived from commercial finance assets held by us 
these fees typically vary widely from period to period and are driven by the amount and seasoning of commercial finance assets held by us 
the large decrease in fiscal was due to the sale of the well seasoned netbank portfolio in fiscal costs and expenses fiscal compared to fiscal costs and expenses from our commercial finance operations decreased by million for fiscal we attribute this decrease primarily to a million reduction in wages and benefits 
our costs have decreased due to several factors i in fiscal  we held significantly higher assets and accordingly  incurred higher servicing costs  ii for fiscal  many of these costs were reimbursed by the investment entities to whom we have sold these assets  and iii in conjunction with converting the operations we acquired in fiscal onto the leaf platform  we have reduced overhead costs by eliminating redundant positions 
furthermore  in response to the ongoing recession and reduced originations  we have increased collection and customer service staff  while to a greater extent  we have decreased sales  credit and lease processing staff 
in total  we reduced the number of full time employees in our commercial finance operations by to as of september  from at september   and a million reduction in other costs and expenses 
this decrease is due to the decline in assets managed for our own account  which resulted in reduced costs to service our portfolio  primarily legal costs  and to our ongoing cost saving and consolidation efforts 
these efforts targeted eliminating overhead redundancies occurring through our acquisitions and taking advantage of efficiencies obtained by operating on a single platform 
in addition  fiscal included one time costs related to the portfolio acquisitions we made  which did not recur in fiscal revenues fiscal compared to fiscal revenues increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal we attribute these increases primarily to the following a million increase in commercial finance revenues primarily as a result of a greater number of assets held on our balance sheet as a result of the netbank assets acquired coupled with increased availability under our credit facilities  a million increase in commercial finance revenues attributable to merit s first full year of operations  
back to index

sales of leases increased by million to billion for fiscal  principally related to commercial assets sold to our investment entities in connection with the netbank and dolphin capital corp 
portfolio acquisitions  a million increase in fund management fees resulting from the million increase in assets under management  and a million increase in other income  reflecting primarily million of net gains on equipment finance dispositions which typically vary widely from period to period  but increased as a result of holding the netbank portfolio on our books 
additionally  documentation fees increased by million in relation to the increase in originations 
costs and expenses fiscal compared to fiscal costs and expenses from our commercial finance operations increased million for fiscal we attribute this increase primarily to the following an increase of million in wages and benefits 
the number of full time employees increased to as of september  from as of september  due to the acquisitions of the netbank and dolphin portfolios and to support our expanding operations 
increases in personnel costs reflect additional costs incurred to service the increased amount of leases held on our books throughout fiscal and that resulted in our increase in finance revenues 
additionally  we incurred additional payroll costs due to our recent acquisitions 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we consolidated certain business operations and reduced duplicative headcount  and an increase of million in operating expenses as a result of our increase in origination capabilities and increased facility costs  primarily due to our acquisitions 
results of operations real estate we anticipate that the focus of our real estate subsidiary  resource real estate  inc  will evolve during fiscal from acquiring and managing performing multifamily assets to acquiring and managing a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate and real estate related debt that has been significantly discounted due to the effects of economic events and high levels of leverage 
we closed resource real estate investors  lp in september after raising million 
we have raised approximately million through december  and continue to raise funds for resource real estate opportunity fund  lp  an offering which invests in discounted real estate and real estate related debt 
we expect to close this fund by december  we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for resource real estate opportunity reit  inc which will further invest in discounted commercial real estate and real estate related debt 
in fiscal  we expect our primary fundraising efforts to focus on this reit 
in our real estate operating segment  we currently manage four classes of assets a commercial real estate debt portfolio we manage for rcc  comprised principally of a notes  whole loans  mortgage participations  b notes  mezzanine debt and related commercial real estate securities  real estate investment fund assets  primarily multifamily apartments  discounted real estate and real estate related debt we acquired through joint ventures with institutional investors and our opportunity fund  and real estate loans  owned assets and ventures  known collectively as our legacy portfolio

our financial fund management operations have depended upon our ability to sponsor cdo issuers and sell their cdos 
although we continue to manage and receive fees from cdo issuers that we formed and sponsored  we do not expect to sponsor any new cdo issuers as a result of current conditions in the global credit markets

during fiscal and  we recorded subordinated management fees of  and million  respectively  on cdo issuers 
the loss recorded during fiscal was primarily the result of the write off of cumulative accrued subordinated management fees that we no longer expect to receive from nine cdo issuers  and a  decrease in senior management fees as a result of portfolio defaults which reduced our collateral base 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in incentive management fees

these management fees are net asset based  and a  decrease in collateral management fees from the european cdo issuer we manage due to a decrease in the euro to dollar exchange rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in collateral management fees resulting from a full year of fees on four bank loan cdo issuers whose management we assumed from an unaffiliated third party asset manager in may  a  increase in rcc management fees and equity compensation  reflecting a  increase in management fees and a  increase in equity compensation  and an  decrease in our share of expenses for the management of trapeza capital management llc and trapeza management group llc  primarily due to a decrease in asset management personnel and state taxes

back to index liquidity and capital resources at september   our liquidity consisted of two primary sources cash of million  including cash proceeds from the issuance of million of senior notes of which million was used to paydown our borrowings outstanding under the td facility  and restricted cash of million comprised of various escrow balances principally million held in leaf collection accounts and million escrowed for taxes and capital improvements for our investment in a hotel property  and cash generated from operations  as well as payments received on leases and loans 
during fiscal  we have concentrated our efforts on deleveraging our balance sheet  reducing our assets by million and borrowings by million  principally from the sale of our interests in apidos cdo vi which generated million in cash and lcff which  together with the repayment of some outstanding receivables from managed entities  generated a total of million in cash 
we also received total proceeds of million from the resolution of certain of our legacy portfolio assets 
we have employed these funds principally to reduce the outstanding borrowings on our existing credit facilities and to fund our asset management operations 
for fiscal  we expect to fund our asset management businesses through a combination of cash on hand  cash generated by operations  and the continued monetization of our non strategic investments  including the legacy portfolio 
our legacy portfolio at september  consists of five loans and six property interests 
because of current economic conditions  the amount of cash we may be able to derive from resolution of our legacy portfolio and other non strategic investments in the future may be limited  in any event  the amount of cash we may derive from them is subject to significant variations 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our legacy portfolio will be a source of significant on going cash generation in the future 
furthermore  we may defer or discount our fees from investment entities based upon current economic conditions 
in certain circumstances  we may also waive all or part of these fees based upon required priority distributions to our investors 
as an asset manager  our liquidity needs consist principally of capital needed to make investments and to pay our operating expenses  primarily for employee wages and benefits 
our ability to meet our liquidity needs will be subject to our ability to generate cash from operations and  with respect to our strategic investments  our ability to raise investor funds and more importantly  to obtain adequate debt financing 
however  the availability of any such financing will depend on market conditions which  as we discuss in overview  have been subject to significant constraints 
in september and october  we completed our private placement offering of three year senior notes  which generated million in cash 
we used a portion of the offering proceeds to paydown our corporate line of credit borrowings under the td bank facility 
in november  we amended the td facility to provide additional flexibility and reduce our debt costs 
in particular  the amendment lowered the minimum interest rate on borrowings  reinstated the libor rate option on borrowings  lowered the required monthly principal paydowns from  to  and extended the term to october the tight credit market continues to limit the ability of leaf and its investment entities to obtain debt financing and as such  reduces its opportunities to grow the commercial finance business 
accordingly  leaf will further monitor and scale back its commercial finance business  as necessary  to accommodate the limited availability of debt financing to its investment entities 
during fiscal  borrowing capacity on our leaf credit facilities has been reduced by million  primarily reflecting the million facility that was transferred on the sale of lcff in addition to reduced limits on the leaf secured revolving credit facility as well as the credit facilities 
an amendment to the leaf facility with pnc in the first quarter of fiscal has further reduced the borrowing capacity 
accordingly  we will continue to scale back our commercial finance business to accommodate the limited availability of debt financing 
if we are unable to renew  replace or expand our sources of financing on substantially similar terms  we may be unable to implement our investment strategies successfully and may be required to liquidate portfolio investments 
if required  a sale of portfolio investments could be at prices lower than the carrying value of such investments  which could result in losses and reduced income 
capital requirements our capital needs consist principally of funds to make investments in the investment vehicles we sponsor or for our own account and to provide bridge financing or other temporary financial support to facilitate asset acquisitions by our sponsored investment vehicles 
accordingly  the amount of capital we require will depend to a significant extent upon our level of activity in making investments for our own account or in sponsoring investment vehicles  all of which is largely within our discretion

the complaint alleges that the offering materials for the cdos were prepared in part by tcm and were false and misleading 
the complaint further alleges that tcm breached fiduciary and contractual obligations by failing to properly monitor the collateral for the cdos  failing to mitigate losses and failing to disclose known quality and performance problems with the underlying collateral 
tcm believes that none of the claims have merit and intends to vigorously defend itself in this matter 
we are also a party to various routine legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business 
management believes that none of these actions  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations 
guarantees 
in connection with the sale of a real estate loan in march  we have agreed that in exchange for the current property owner relinquishing certain control rights  we would make payments to the current property owner under stipulated circumstances  including the sale or foreclosure of the property or a subsequent resale of the loan 
a payment of million  increasing  per month to a maximum of million  would be due upon the occurrence of specified events 
in addition  the current property owner has the right to receive collateral as security for this obligation equal to or greater than of the value of the obligation upon the occurrence of certain specified events or if our net worth falls below million 
our obligation runs through december  in addition  we agreed to partially indemnify the purchaser of the loan for a portion of the difference between ordinary income tax rates and capital gain rates on accrued interest on the note between the date of sale of the loan in march and december

tic investment programs and real estate partnerships obtain senior lien financing with respect to acquired properties  on a non recourse basis  with the lenders remedies limited to the properties securing the senior lien financing 
although non recourse in nature  these loans are subject to limited standard exceptions  which we have guaranteed  or carveouts 
these carveouts will expire as the related indebtedness is paid down over the next ten years 
subsidiaries of the ours are both i the general partner of the real estate limited partnerships or the asset manager of the tic investment programs and ii the property manager of all of these properties 
accordingly  we have control over the operations of the underlying assets which mitigates the potential risk associated with these carveouts  and accordingly  no liabilities for these obligations have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
to date  we have not been required to make any carveout payments 
general corporate commitments 
as a specialized asset manager  we sponsor investment funds in which we may make an equity investment along with outside investors 
this equity investment is generally based on a percentage of funds raised and varies among investment programs 
we have committed to purchase units equal to of one of our real estate funds gross offering proceeds  or million at september  we will purchase our shares at the close of funding which is anticipated to be in december we are also party to employment agreements with senior executives that provide for compensation and other benefits  including severance payments under specified circumstances

additionally  chadwick serves as an introducing agent for transactions involving sales of securities of financial services companies  reits and insurance companies 
as a broker dealer  chadwick is subject to the net capital provision of rule c under the securities exchange act of  which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital  as defined

two financial fund management investment entities that have incentive distributions  also known as carried interest  are subject to a potential clawback to the extent that such distributions exceed their cumulative net profits  as defined in the respective partnership agreements 
during fiscal  based upon the evaluation of current information  we reduced the total potential clawback obligation by million to million at september  from million at september  the estimated liability is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
on november   we purchased substantially all the remaining third party limited partner interests in these investment entities for million 
we believe that this transaction will result in a further reduction of our potential clawback liability 
as of september   except for the clawback liability recorded for the two financial fund management investment entities  we do not believe it is probable that any payments will be required under any of our indemnifications and accordingly  no liabilities for these obligations have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and cost and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we make estimates of our allowance for credit losses  the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  discounts on management fees  and in determining whether a decrease in the fair value of an investment is an other than temporary impairment 
significant estimates for the commercial finance segment include the unguaranteed residual values of leased equipment  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill and the fair value and effectiveness of interest rate swaps 
the financial fund management segment makes assumptions in determining the fair value of our investments in securities available for sale and in estimating the liability  if any  for clawback provisions on certain of our partnership interests 
we used assumptions  specifically inputs to the black scholes pricing model and the discounted cash flow model  in computing the fair value of the senior notes and warrants 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations

back to index stock based compensation employee stock options 
we expense employee stock option grants over their respective vesting periods  based on the estimated fair value of each award as determined on the date of grant 
loans loans held for investment 
prior to march   apidos cdo vi purchased participations in secured bank loans in the secondary market and through syndications of newly originated loans 
these loans were held for investment and  as such  were initially recorded at their purchase price and subsequently accounted for based on their outstanding principal plus or minus any unamortized premiums or discounts and reduced as needed by an allowance for credit losses 
purchases and sales of loans held for investment were recorded on a trade date basis 
trades that did not settle as of september  were classified as loans sold  not settled 
interest income on these loans included interest at stated rates as adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts 
premiums and discounts were amortized or accreted into interest income using the effective interest method which recognized a level interest rate as a percentage of the carrying amount of the loan 
loans held for investment were generally evaluated for impairment individually  but loans purchased on a pooled basis with relatively smaller balances and substantially similar characteristics could have been evaluated collectively for impairment 
loans held for investment were separated into four categories for evaluation of impairment 
when a loan became impaired  the credit loss was increased by the amount of the excess of the amortized cost basis of the loan over its fair value 
fair value was based on i market price  if available  ii the fair value of the collateral less estimated disposition costs  or iii the present value of estimated cash flows 
increases in the allowance for credit losses were recognized in the statements of operations as a provision for credit losses 
when a loan  or a portion thereof  was considered uncollectible and pursuit of the collection was not warranted  we recorded a charge off or write down of the loan against the allowance for credit losses 
real estate loans 
real estate loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at the amount of unpaid principal  reduced by unearned income and an allowance for credit losses  if necessary 
these loans are included in investments in real estate in the consolidated balance sheets 
interest on these loans is calculated based upon the principal amount outstanding 
accrual of interest is stopped on a loan when management believes  after considering economic factors  business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
an impaired real estate loan may remain on accrual status during the period in which we are pursuing repayment of the loan  however  the loan is placed on non accrual status at such time as either i management believes that contractual debt service payments will not be met  ii the loan becomes days delinquent  and iii management determines the borrower is incapable of  or has ceased efforts toward  curing the cause of the impairment 
while on non accrual status  we recognize interest income only when an actual payment is received 
we maintain an allowance for real estate loans at a level deemed sufficient to absorb probable losses 
we consider general and local economic conditions  neighborhood values  competitive overbuilding  casualty losses and other factors that may affect the value of real estate loans 
the value of loans and real estate may also be affected by factors such as the cost of compliance with regulations and liability under applicable environmental laws  changes in interest rates and the availability of financing 
income from a property will be reduced if a significant number of tenants are unable to pay rent or if available space cannot be rented on favorable terms 
in addition  we review all credits on a quarterly basis and continually monitor collections and payments from our borrowers and maintain an allowance for credit losses based upon our historical experience and knowledge of specific borrower collection issues 
we reduce our investments in real estate loans and real estate by an allowance for amounts that may become unrealizable in the future 
such allowance can be either specific to a particular loan or property or general to all loans and real estate 
investments in commercial finance our investments in commercial finance consist of loans  direct financing leases  operating leases and future payment card receivables 
those investments that we are holding for sale to our investment entities are reflected separately at fair value as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets 
loans 
for term loans  the investment consists of the sum of the total future minimum loan payments receivable less unearned finance income 
unearned finance income  which is recognized as revenue over the term of the financing by the effective interest method  represents the excess of the total future minimum contracted payments over the original cost of the loan 
for all other loans  interest income is recorded at the stated rate on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 

back to index 
back to index direct financing leases 
certain of our lease transactions are accounted for as direct financing leases as distinguished from operating leases 
such leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the customer 
our investment in direct financing leases consists of the sum of the total future minimum contracted payments receivable and the estimated unguaranteed residual value of leased equipment  less unearned finance income 
unearned finance income  which is recognized as revenue over the term of the financing by the effective interest method  represents the excess of the total future minimum lease payments plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value expected to be realized at the end of the lease term over the cost of the related equipment 
initial direct costs incurred in the consummation of the lease are capitalized as part of the investment in lease receivables and amortized over the lease term as a reduction of the yield 
we discontinue recognizing revenue for lease and loans for which payments are more than days past due 
fees from delinquent payments are recognized when received 
operating leases 
leases not meeting any of the criteria to be classified as direct financing leases are deemed to be operating leases 
under the accounting for operating leases  the cost of the leased equipment  including acquisition fees associated with lease placements  is recorded as an asset and depreciated on a straight line basis over the equipment s estimated useful life  generally up to seven years 
rental income consists primarily of monthly periodic rental payments due under the terms of the leases 
we recognize rental income on a straight line basis 
during the lease term of existing operating leases  we may not recover all of the cost and related expenses of our rental equipment and  therefore  it is prepared to remarket the equipment in future years 
our policy is to review  on at least a quarterly basis  the expected economic life of its rental equipment in order to determine the recoverability of its undepreciated cost 
we write down our rental equipment to its estimated net realizable value when it is probable that its carrying amount exceeds such value and the excess can be reasonably estimated  gains are only recognized upon actual sale of the rental equipment 
there were no write downs of equipment during fiscal  and future payment card receivables 
merit provides capital advances to small businesses based on future credit card receipts 
the future payment card receivables in the merit portfolio have risk characteristics that are different than those in other portfolios originated by us 
revenues from merit are recorded under the effective interest method 
under this method  an effective interest rate  irr  is applied to the cost basis of the future credit card receivable 
the irr that is calculated when the future credit card receivable is originated remains constant and is the basis for subsequent impairment testing and income recognition 
we discontinue revenue recognition when no payments have been received for days 
if the amount and timing of the future cash collections are not reasonably estimable  we account for the future credit card receivable on the cost recovery method 
under the cost recovery method of accounting  no income is recognized until the basis of the future payment card receivable have been recovered 
allowance for credit losses 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses in commercial finance including investments in leases  loans and future payment card receivables based upon  among other factors  our historical experience with the commercial finance portfolios we manage  an analysis of contractual delinquencies  economic conditions and trends  industry statistics and equipment finance portfolio characteristics  as adjusted for expected recoveries 
in evaluating historic performance of leases and loans  we perform a migration analysis  which estimates the likelihood that an account progresses through delinquency stages to ultimate write off 
for merit  the allowance for losses is based upon its previous loss history  economic conditions and trends 
our policy is to charge off to the allowance those financings for which we believe the collectability is unlikely 
investments in commercial finance assets held for sale 
commercial finance assets  which we do not have the intent to hold until maturity  are classified as commercial finance assets held for sale 
these investments  which primarily consist of loans and direct financing leases  are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
cost basis includes deferred origination fees and costs 
fair value is determined based upon discounted cash flow models 
investment securities available for sale our investment securities available for sale  including the investments in the cdo issuers we sponsored  which are owned directly as well as indirectly through the consolidation of the sff entities  are carried at fair value 
the fair value of these cdo investments is based primarily on internally generated expected cash flow models that require significant management judgment and estimation due to the lack of market activity and unobservable pricing inputs 
our investments in affiliates  including holdings in the bancorp  inc tbbk nasdaq tbbk and rcc  are valued at the closing price of the respective stock 
the fair value of the cumulative net unrealized gains and losses on these investment securities  net of tax  are reported through accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on the basis of specific identification and are included in net income 
we recognize a realized loss when it is probable there has been an adverse change in the security holder s estimated cash flow from that estimated in previous projections 
the security is written down to fair value  and the unrealized loss is transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the statement of operations as a reduction of current earnings 
the cost basis adjustment for other than temporary impairment would be recoverable only upon the sale or maturity of the security 

back to index 
back to index periodically  we review the carrying value of our available for sale securities 
if we deem an unrealized loss to be other than temporary  it will record an impairment charge 
we process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors 
these factors include i the duration of a significant decline in value  ii the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  iii the magnitude of the decline  iv the collateral structure and other credit support  as applicable  and v our intent and ability to hold the investment until the value recovers 
when the analysis of the above factors results in a conclusion that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the cost of the investment is written down to fair value 
we recognize dividend income on our securities classified as available for sale on the ex dividend date 
accounting for income taxes we adjust the balance of our deferred taxes to reflect the tax rates at which future taxable amounts will likely be settled or realized 
the effects of tax rate changes on deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets  as well as other changes in income tax laws  are recognized in net earnings in the period during which such changes are enacted 
valuation allowances are established and adjusted  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we assess our ability to realize deferred tax assets primarily based on the earnings history and future earnings potential of the legal entities through which the deferred tax assets will be realized 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
instead  a review for impairment is performed at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment might have occurred 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level using a two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  step two is completed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
in step two  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying amount 
the implied fair value of goodwill is computed by subtracting the sum of the fair values of the individual asset categories tangible and intangible from the indicated fair value of the reporting unit as determined under step one 
to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
we utilize the discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units for our impairment review of goodwill 
the discounted cash flow approach requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors  including revenue and market growth  operating cash flows  market multiples  and discount rates 
these assumptions are based on the current economic environment and credit market conditions 
long lived assets and identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in fiscal  leaf acquired the leasing division of pacific capital bank na and recorded goodwill of million 
we test for impairment on an annual basis as of may st 
due to the potential impact of the economic recession and the scarcity of debt financing in the marketplace we performed  as of december  and september   interim assessments of our goodwill for impairment at the commercial finance reporting unit 
based on a third party valuation as well as test results that were internally generated  we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill at december   may  or september  additionally  in connection with the pacific capital bank acquisition  we acquired customer relationships with pacific capital s third party originators  classified as a customer related intangible asset 
the value of the intangible asset consists of the estimated excess of future cash inflows over the related cash outflows generated by the acquired customer base and relationships with third party originators 
we amortize the intangible asset over the expected useful life of the asset and continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of the intangible asset may not be recoverable 
we determined that the intangible asset was not impaired as of september   and 
back to index 
back to index derivative instruments our policies permit it to enter into derivative contracts  including interest rate swaps and caps to add stability to its financing costs and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
we have designed these transactions as cash flow hedges 
the contracts or hedge instruments are evaluated at inception and at subsequent balance sheet dates to determine if they continue to qualify for hedge accounting and  accordingly  derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
we record changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative in accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent that it is effective 
any ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
recent accounting standards in june  the fasb identified the fasb accounting standards codification  or asc  as the authoritative source of us gaap other than guidance put forth by the us securities and exchange commission 
all other accounting literature not included in the asc will be considered non authoritative 
we adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal and revised our disclosures accordingly for references to us gaap 
accounting standards issued but not yet effective the fasb has issued the following accounting standards which are not yet effective for us as of september  fair value of liabilities 
in august  the fasb clarified techniques for valuing a liability in circumstances where a quoted price for an identical liability is not available 
the provisions of this guidance are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal contingencies in business combinations 
in april  the fasb issued guidance which requires an acquirer to recognize at fair value  at the acquisition date  an asset acquired and or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period 
this standard is effective for us for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is after september  consolidations 
in june  the fasb issued guidance which requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in an entity  and an ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a variable interest entity  or vie  and whether an interest in a vie makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the vie and  thus  is required to consolidate the vie in its financial statements 
this guidance is effective for us beginning october  the fasb also issued guidance which eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  or spe  changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and requires greater transparency of related disclosures 
this guidance is effective for our fiscal year and interim periods beginning october  disclosure of plan assets of pension and other postretirement plans 
the fasb enhanced the disclosures required for the plan assets of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
these disclosures are intended to provide users of financial statements with a greater understanding of i how investment allocation decisions are made  including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies  ii the major categories of plan assets  iii the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets  iv the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period  and v significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
this guidance is effective for us in fiscal participating securities 
in june  the fasb issued guidance which addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share 
unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and are to be included in the computation of earnings per share 
all prior period earnings per share data presented must be adjusted retrospectively 
this guidance is effective for us in fiscal useful life of intangible assets 
in april  the fasb amended the factors to be considered in developing a renewal or extension of assumptions used for purposes of determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
this guidance is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset and is effective for us in fiscal 
back to index 
back to index business combinations 
in december  the fasb established principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination i recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling minority interest in the acquiree  ii recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and iii determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
additionally  all costs related to an acquisition are to be expensed as incurred 
this guidance applies prospectively to business combinations made by us on or after october noncontrolling interests 
in december  the fasb established accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
this guidance is effective for us in fiscal with the exception of the guidance on the consolidation of vies which we are still evaluating  we do not believe that these standards will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
newly adopted accounting principles we adopted the following accounting standards during fiscal fair value and other than temporary impairment  or otti 
in april  the fasb issued the following new financial staff positions which provided further guidance on fair value and otti which we adopted in the third quarter of fiscal a two step approach to determine whether or not a market is active 
the guidance further provides that if a transaction is considered to have been entered into on a distressed basis  the entity should use its own judgment rather than relying on observable transactions 
an entity must recognize an otti only at the time at which it intends or is required to sell the asset prior to the recovery of its cost basis 
the guidance also changes the presentation of otti for debt securities that the entity does not intend to sell 
impairments are separated into two components i the amount of impairments related to credit losses and ii the amount related to other factors 
the amount of impairment related to credit losses is reflected as a charge to earnings  while the amount deemed to be related to other factors is reflected as an adjustment to shareholders equity through other comprehensive income 
disclosures about fair value of financial instruments are required in interim as well as in annual financial statements 
these disclosures are also required in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods 
subsequent events 
in may  the fasb issued guidance which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued 
we adopted this guidance in the third quarter of fiscal disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in march  the fasb issued guidance that requires enhanced disclosures for derivative instruments  including those used in hedging activities 
we adopted this guidance in the second quarter of fiscal although the adoption did not have a significant impact on our financial statements  additional disclosures were added to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements in inactive and distressed markets 
in october  the fasb issued clarification of when the market for a financial asset is inactive 
this guidance had no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
transfers of financial assets and interests in vies 
in december  the fasb issued guidance that requires public entities to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets 
it also requires public enterprises  including sponsors that have a variable interest in a vie  to provide additional disclosures about the vie 
additionally  this guidance requires certain disclosures to be provided by a public enterprise that is i a sponsor of a spe that holds a variable interest in the qualifying spe but was not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying spe and ii a servicer of a qualifying spe that holds a significant variable interest in the qualifying spe but was not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying spe 
the required disclosures are intended to provide greater transparency to financial statement users about a transferor s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets and an enterprise s involvement with vies and qualifying spes 
we adopted this pronouncement as of october  and have included the appropriate disclosures within our consolidated financial statements as of september  enhanced disclosures about credit derivatives and guarantees 
in september  the fasb issued guidance to improve disclosures about credit derivatives by requiring more information about the potential adverse effects of changes in credit risk on financial position  financial performance  and cash flows of the sellers of credit derivatives 
we adopted this pronouncement as of december  and have included the appropriate disclosures within our consolidated financial statements

back to index fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued guidance which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the fair value option permits an entity to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
entities choosing the fair value option are required to report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
we elected to not to apply this guidance to any of our existing assets or liabilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk resource america is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we have not entered into any market sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
the range of changes presented reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period and provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
general we are exposed to various market risks  principally fluctuating interest rates 
these risks can impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities 
the following analyzes the potential impact on our earnings  cash flows and financial position from a hypothetical change in market risk factors as of september  our analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
commercial finance we hold commercial finance assets for sale which are comprised of loans and leases at fixed rates of interest 
these assets are generally sold to our leasing investment entities at fair value  generally within three months from the date acquired 
accordingly  our exposure to changes in market interest rates on these assets is minimized 
to finance these assets  we have a million variable rate revolving warehouse credit facility with a group of banks led by national city bank  which had an outstanding balance of million at september  interest is charged at one of two rates i libor plus  or ii the prime rate 
a hypothetical change in libor would change our annual interest expense by  real estate portfolio loans and related senior liens 
as of september   we believe that a loan held in our legacy portfolio that is subordinate to senior liens is not sensitive to changes in interest rates since the loan is subject to forbearance or other agreements that require all of the operating cash flow from the property underlying the loan  after debt service on senior lien interest  to be paid to us and therefore is not currently being paid based on the stated interest rate of the loan  the senior lien interest ahead of our interest is at a fixed rate and is not subject to interest rate fluctuation that would affect payments to us  and the loan has significant accrued and unpaid interest and other charges outstanding to which cash flow from the underlying property would be applied even if cash flows were to exceed the interest due  as originally underwritten 
other loans 
a mortgage owned by a vie that we consolidated at september  is at a fixed interest rate and  therefore  not subject to interest rate fluctuations 
other at september   we had two secured revolving credit facilities for general business use 
weighted average borrowings on these two facilities were million for fiscal at an effective interest rate of 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate on these facilities would change our annual interest expense by
