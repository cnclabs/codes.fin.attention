we expect to finance our growth  acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds  proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets 
we compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers  some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments 
principal factors of competition are rents charged  attractiveness of location  the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided 
our success depends upon  among other factors  trends of the national  regional and local economies  the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers  availability and cost of capital  construction and renovation costs  taxes  governmental regulations  legislation and population trends

in the second half of the residential mortgage and capital markets began showing signs of stress  primarily in the form of escalating default rates on sub prime mortgages  declining home values and increasing inventory nationwide 
in  the credit crisis spread to the broader commercial credit and financial markets resulting in illiquidity and volatility in the bond and equity markets 
we are currently in an economic recession which has negatively affected all businesses  including ours 
during the past year  real estate transactions have diminished significantly and capitalization rates have risen 
our real estate portfolio may be affected by declining demand for office and retail space and tenant bankruptcies  which may result in lower average occupancy rates and effective rents  and a corresponding decrease in net income  funds from operations and cash flow 
in addition  the value of our assets  including investments in joint ventures  marketable securities  and mezzanine loans may also decline  and may result in impairment charges and or valuation allowances and a corresponding decrease in net income and funds from operations

we were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because h street and its partially owned entities were operated as c corporations at the time they were acquired

overview continued leasing activity the following table sets forth certain information for the properties we own directly or indirectly  including leasing activity 
the leasing activity presented below is based on leases signed during the period and is not intended to coincide with the commencement of rental revenue recognition in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
tenant improvements and leasing commissions are presented below based on square feet leased during the period  on a per square foot and per square foot per annum basis based on weighted average lease terms and as a percentage of initial rent per square foot

pursuant to sfas  acquired below market leases are marked to market at the time of their acquisition 
accordingly  when the space is subsequently re leased  the cash basis rent increase is greater than the gaap basis rent increase 
critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of real estate  net of accumulated depreciation  were billion and billion  respectively 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
if we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
upon the acquisition of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired assets including land  buildings and improvements  identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and customer relationships and acquired liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments 
we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions 
our properties  including any related intangible assets  are individually reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over our anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis 
an impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property s carrying amount over its estimated fair value 
impairment analyses are based on our current plans  intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared 
if our estimates of the projected future cash flows  our anticipated holding period for properties  or the estimated fair value of properties change based on market conditions or otherwise  our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based  in part  on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results 
plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses 
identified intangible assets upon an acquisition of a business we record intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill 
we amortize identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired 
intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset  including the related real estate when appropriate  is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets  a component of other assets on our consolidated balance sheets  were  and  respectively 
in addition  the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities  a component of deferred credit on our consolidated balance sheets  were  and  respectively 
if the intangible assets are deemed to be impaired  or the estimated useful lives of finite life intangibles assets or liabilities change  the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material 
critical accounting policies continued mezzanine loans receivable we invest in mezzanine loans to entities which have significant real estate assets 
these investments  which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property  are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate 
we record investments in mezzanine loans at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of mezzanine loans receivable were  and  respectively 
we accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method  or straight line method if the result is not materially different 
we evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans  if circumstances warrant  in determining whether they are impaired 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
when a loan is impaired  the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or  as a practical expedient  to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if our estimates of the collectibility of both interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on market conditions or otherwise  our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
partially owned entities as of december  and  the carrying amounts of investments and advances to partially owned entities  including alexander s and toys r us  were billion and billion  respectively 
in determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity  we consider factors such as ownership interest  board representation  management representation  authority to make decisions  and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we will absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses  if they occur  or receive the majority of the expected residual returns  if they occur  or both 
we account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met  and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee 
equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions 
investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method 
our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable 
the ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary 
if our estimates of the projected future cash flows  the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned  and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise  our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based  in part  on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  and  as of december  and for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements 
we also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents  and  as of december  and 
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
these estimates may differ from actual results  which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies continued revenue recognition we have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rent income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases 
we commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use 
in addition  in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant  we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
percentage rent income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold 
these rents are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  sales thresholds have been achieved 
hotel revenue income arising from the operation of the hotel pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue  food and beverage revenue  and banquet revenue 
income is recognized when rooms are occupied 
food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered 
trade shows revenue income arising from the operation of trade shows  including rentals of booths 
this revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred 
expense reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property 
this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
management  leasing and other fees income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities 
this revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements 
before we recognize revenue  we assess  among other things  its collectibility 
if our assessment of the collectibility of revenue changes  the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
income taxes we operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit under sections of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
we distribute to our shareholders of our taxable income 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is required 
if we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders  or fail to meet other reit requirements  we may fail to qualify as a reit which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences 
recently issued accounting literature in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas was effective for our financial assets and liabilities on january  the fasb has deferred the implementation of the provisions of sfas relating to certain non financial assets and liabilities until january  this standard did not materially affect how we determine fair value  but resulted in certain additional disclosures 
sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities  level observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets  but corroborated by market data  and level unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to level inputs and the lowest priority to level inputs 
in determining fair value  we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value 
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in our consolidated financial statements primarily consist of i marketable securities  ii the assets of our deferred compensation plan primarily marketable securities and equity investments in limited partnerships  for which there is a corresponding liability on our consolidated balance sheets and iii class a units of the operating partnership  held by third parties 
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of december  are presented in the table below based on their level in the fair value hierarchy 
fair value hierarchy amounts in thousands total level level level marketable securities deferred compensation plan assets included in other assets interest rate caps included in other assets total assets class a units included in minority interest deferred compensation plan liabilities we chose not to elect the fair value option prescribed by statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  for our financial assets and liabilities that had not been previously measured at fair value 
these financial assets and liabilities include our outstanding debt  accounts receivable  accounts payable and investments in partially owned entities 
the fair value of level deferred compensation plan assets represents equity investments in certain limited partnerships  for which there is a corresponding level liability to the plan s participants 
the following is a summary of changes in level deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities  for the year ended december amounts in thousands beginning balance total realized unrealized losses purchases  sales  other settlements and issuances  net ending balance for the year ended december  recently issued accounting literature continued in february  the fasb issued sfas  which permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas was effective on january  we did not elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial instruments on the effective date and have not determined whether we will elect this option for any eligible financial instruments we acquire in the future 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r broadens the guidance of sfas  extending its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
sfas r also broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and interests transferred as a result of business combinations  and acquisition related costs will generally be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition 
sfas r expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
sfas r is effective for all transactions entered into on or after january  the adoption of this standard on january  could materially impact our future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate  in part because acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred compared to our current practice of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be identified in the consolidated financial statements 
sfas also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent s ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation 
as of december   as part of our preparation for the adoption of sfas  which is effective for us on january   we have retroactively adopted the measurement provisions of eitf topic d  classification and measurement of redeemable securities 
upon adoption  we adjusted the carrying amounts of the class a units held by third parties  a component of minority interest on our consolidated balance sheets  by recognizing a  increase to the january  balance of minority interest and a corresponding decrease in earnings in excess of less than distributions which ws accounted for a cumulative effect adjustment on january  subsequent adjustments to the carrying amounts of the class a units  to reflect their redemption value at the end of each reporting period  were recorded to additional capital 
the adoption of sfas on january   will not result in the re classification of the carrying amounts of the class a units held by third parties to a component within shareholders equity 
in march  the fasb issued statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires enhanced disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities  including disclosures regarding how an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and the impact of derivative instruments and related hedged items on an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
sfas is effective on january  we believe that the adoption of this standard on january  will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting literature continued in may  the fasb issued staff position no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  the fsp  which is effective for us on january  and requires retroactive application 
the adoption of this fsp will affect the accounting for our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and series d convertible preferred units 
the fsp requires the initial proceeds from the sale of our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and series d convertible preferred units to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component 
the resulting discount will be amortized using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding as additional interest expense 
the adoption of the fsp on january  will result in the recognition of an aggregate unamortized debt discount of  as of december  in our consolidated balance sheets and additional interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
our current estimate of the incremental interest expense  net of minority interest  for each reporting period is as follows amounts in thousands for the year ended december in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for financial guarantee insurance contracts sfas 
sfas was issued to decrease inconsistencies within statement no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises  and clarify how it applies to financial guarantee insurance contracts issued by insurance enterprises  including the recognition of premium revenue and claim liabilities 
sfas also requires expanded disclosures about financial guarantee insurance contracts 
sfas is effective on january  we believe that the adoption of this standard on january  will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf issue  determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf 
paragraph a of sfas specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both a indexed to the company s own stock and b classified in stockholders equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument 
eitf provides a new two step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer s own stock and thus able to qualify for the sfas paragraph a scope exception

the debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in   and and in certain other limited circumstances 
the debentures are convertible  under certain circumstances  for cash and vornado common shares at an initial conversion rate of common shares per  of principal amount of debentures 
the initial conversion price was  which represented a premium of over the march  closing price for our common shares 
the principal amount of debentures will be settled for cash and the amount in excess of the principal defined as the conversion value will be settled in cash or  at our election  vornado common shares

coverage for certified acts of terrorism is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the federal government with no exposure to ppic 
prior to the formation of ppic  we were uninsured for nbcr losses

we continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism

our debt instruments  consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are generally non recourse to us  senior unsecured notes  exchangeable senior debentures  convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance 
although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements  we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future 
further  if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio

the environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination 
however  there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination  changes in the extent or known scope of contamination  the discovery of additional sites  or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us

on january   stop shop filed a complaint with the united states district court for the district of new jersey usdc nj claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the  of annual rent from stop shop pursuant to the master agreement and guaranty  because of the expiration of the east brunswick  jersey city  middletown  union and woodbridge leases to which the  of additional rent was previously allocated 
stop shop asserted that a prior order of the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york dated february   as modified on appeal to the district court for the southern district of new york on february   froze our right to re allocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from stop shop 
on march   after we moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction  stop shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint 
on march   stop shop filed a new complaint in new york supreme court  asserting substantially the same claims as in its usdc nj complaint 
we removed the action to the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
in january that court remanded the action to the new york supreme court 
on february   we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that stop shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the master agreement and guaranty remain in effect 
on may   we filed a motion for summary judgment 
on july   stop shop opposed our motion and filed a cross motion for summary judgment 
on december   the court issued its decision denying the motions for summary judgment 
both parties appealed the court s decision and on december   the appellate court division issued a decision affirming the court s decision 
on january   we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the appellate court s decision which was denied on march  we are currently engaged in discovery and anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in we intend to vigorously pursue our claims against stop shop 
in our opinion  after consultation with legal counsel  the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
on may   we acquired a controlling interest in avenue of the americas and the california street complex 
our interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own  through us entities  the sole general partnership interest and a limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties

mr 
trump s claims arose out of a dispute over the sale price of and use of proceeds from  the sale of properties located on the former penn central rail yards between west th and nd streets in manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships 
in decisions dated september  and july   the court denied several of mr 
trump s motions and ultimately dismissed all of mr 
trump s claims  except for his claim seeking access to books and records 
in a decision dated october   the court determined that mr 
trump had already received access to the books and records to which he was entitled  with the exception of certain documents which were subsequently delivered to mr 
trump 
mr 
trump sought re argument and renewal on  and filed a notice of appeal in connection with  his dismissed claims 
in a decision dated january   the court denied all of mr 
trump s motions 
mr 
trump has filed a notice appealing the and decisions 
in connection with the acquisition  we agreed to indemnify the sellers for liabilities and expenses arising out of mr 
trump s claim that the general partners of the partnerships we acquired did not sell the rail yards at a fair price or could have sold the rail yards for a greater price and any other claims asserted in the legal action  provided however  that if mr 
trump prevails on certain claims involving partnership matters  other than claims relating to sale price  the sellers will be required to reimburse us for certain costs related to those claims 
we believe that the claims relating to the sale price are without merit 
all other allegations are not asserted as a basis for damages and regardless of merit  in our opinion  after consultation with legal counsel  will not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operation or cash flows 
in july  we acquired h street building corporation h street which has a subsidiary that owns  among other things  a tenancy in common interest in land located in arlington county  virginia  known as pentagon row  leased to two tenants 
in april  h street acquired the remaining interest in that fee 
in april  we received letters from those tenants  street retail  inc and post apartment homes  lp  claiming they had a right of first offer triggered by each of those transactions 
on september   both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners 
the claim alleges the right to purchase the fee interest  damages in excess of  and punitive damages

th street l street crystal mall two fifth avenue other funds from operations ffo ffo is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
nareit defines ffo as net income or loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo and ffo per diluted share are used by management  investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity reits 
ffo and ffo per diluted share should be evaluated along with gaap net income and income per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap measures  as well as cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  in evaluating the operating performance of equity reits 
management believes that ffo and ffo per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  these non gaap measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in our statements of cash flows 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity

our exposure to a change in interest rates on our consolidated and non consolidated debt all of which arises out of non trading activity is as follows amounts in thousands  except per share amounts december  balance weighted average interest rate effect of change in base rates december  balance weighted average interest rate consolidated debt variable rate fixed rate pro rata share of debt of non consolidated entities non recourse variable rate excluding toys variable rate toys fixed rate including  and  of toys debt in and minority limited partners share of above total change in annual net income per share diluted we may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings  including hedging strategies  depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies 
as of december   variable rate debt with an aggregate principal amount of  and a weighted average interest rate of was subject to libor caps 
these caps are based on a notional amount of  and cap libor at a weighted average rate of 
as of december   we have investments in mezzanine loans with an aggregate carrying amount of  that are based on variable interest rates which partially mitigate our exposure to a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
fair value of our debt the estimated fair value of our debt at december  was less than its aggregate carrying amount by approximately  based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the current rate at which we believe similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt 
derivative instruments we have  and may in the future enter into  derivative positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
because these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the gains or losses resulting from their mark to market at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on our consolidated statements of income 
in addition  we are  and may in the future be  subject to additional expense based on the notional amount of the derivative positions and a specified spread over libor 
because the market value of these instruments can vary significantly between periods  we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our investment income or expense 
in  we recognized a net loss of  and in and we recognized net gains aggregating approximately  and  respectively  from these positions
