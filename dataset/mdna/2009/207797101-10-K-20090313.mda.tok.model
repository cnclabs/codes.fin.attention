table of contents our regulated business on july   the company announced that it had reached a definitive purchase agreement with ellington acres company ellington acres to purchase all of ellington acres outstanding stock for approximately million 
ellington acres is a regulated water company serving approximately customers in ellington and somers  connecticut  situated between two systems in the company s northern region that the company had planned to interconnect 
the company will be able to interconnect the two systems in the northern region with ellington acres  saving ratepayers of both connecticut water and ellington acres significant capital expenditures 
the department of utility control dpuc approved the acquisition in december and the company completed the transaction on january  the company expects the integration to be materially complete in the second quarter of for more information  please refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on january   connecticut water and newus acquired the regulated water utility assets of eastern connecticut regional water company  inc eastern  a wholly owned subsidiary of birmingham utilities  inc 
birmingham and the unregulated assets of birmingham ho services  inc ho for million  at which point all of the former customers of eastern became customers of connecticut water 
the acquisition of eastern added more than  residential customers residing in towns across connecticut  some only a few miles from existing connecticut water systems 
the operations of birmingham have been fully integrated as of december  in july  the company filed a rate application with the dpuc for connecticut water requesting an increase in rates of approximately million  or 
on january   the dpuc issued its final decision and approved a settlement agreement  negotiated with the office of consumer counsel and the dpuc s prosecutorial staff  that allowed connecticut water an increase in revenues of approximately  or 
the settlement agreement allowed connecticut water to defer a portion of the approved rate increase  approximately million through december  and million through march  the company recognized that increase through recording deferred revenues and a corresponding regulatory asset  as required by the decision 
on january   the company filed to reopen the case  a procedure required by the settlement agreement  to implement the second phase 
in addition to the approval for the inclusion in current rates of the previously approved deferred revenues of million  the filing includes requested recovery and a return on a million of additional capital investments made in on march  an increase was approved 
the approved rates became effective on april  our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and weather variations 
the demand for water is generally greater during the warmer months than the cooler months due to customers incremental water consumption related to cooling systems and various outdoor uses such as private and public swimming pools and lawn sprinklers 
demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels from year to year and season to season  particularly during the warmer months 
in general  the profitability of the water utility industry is largely dependent on the timeliness and adequacy of rates allowed by utility regulatory commissions 
in addition  profitability is affected by numerous factors over which we have little or no control  such as costs to comply with security  environmental  and water quality regulations 
inflation and other factors also impact costs for construction  materials and personnel related expenses 

table of contents costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
since the enactment of the safe drinking water act  we have spent approximately million in constructing facilities and conducting aquifer mapping necessary to comply with the requirements of the safe drinking water act  and other federal and state regulations  of which million was expended in the last five years 
the company expects to spend approximately million in on safe water drinking act projects  primarily to bring newly acquired systems up to the company s standards 
the company believes that we are presently in compliance with current regulations  but the regulations are subject to change at any time 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify existing filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 
connecticut water derives its rights and franchises to operate from special state acts that are subject to alteration  amendment or repeal and do not grant us exclusive rights to our service areas 
our franchises are free from burdensome restrictions  are unlimited as to time  and authorize us to sell potable water in all the towns we now serve 
there is the possibility that the state of connecticut could attempt to revoke our franchises and allow a governmental entity to take over some or all of our systems 
while we would vigorously oppose any such attempts  from time to time such legislation is contemplated 
the rates we charge our water customers are established under the jurisdiction of and are approved by the dpuc 
it is our policy to seek rate relief as necessary to enable us to achieve an adequate rate of return 
as noted above  on march   the dpuc approved an increase of revenues for connecticut water effective april  connecticut water s allowed return on equity and return on rate base are and  respectively 
on october   the company filed its infrastructure assessment report iar under the water infrastructure and conservation adjustment wica act which was passed into law in wica allows the company to add a surcharge to customers bills  subject to an expedited review and approval by the dpuc  to reflect the costs of replacement of certain types of aging utility plant 
the purpose of the iar is to clearly define the criteria for determining the priority of future replacement projects 
the first public hearing on the company s iar took place on january  the company expects a decision from the dpuc on its iar in the first quarter of the company does not expect to file for a surcharge under the wica mechanism until the second quarter of approximately days after the surcharge filing  customers would begin to see an increase in their bills 
our water systems our water infrastructure consists of noncontiguous water systems in the state of connecticut 
our system  in total  consists of approximately  miles of water main and reservoir storage capacity of billion gallons 
the safe  dependable yield from our active wells and reservoirs is approximately million gallons per day 
water sources vary among the individual systems  but overall approximately of the total dependable yield comes from reservoirs and from wells 
as of december   connecticut water s  customers consumed approximately billion gallons of water generating  in revenue 
we supply water  and in most cases  fire protection to all or portions of towns in connecticut 

table of contents the following table breaks down the above total figures by customer class as of december   and customers residential commercial industrial public authority fire protection other including non metered accounts total water revenues in thousands residential commercial industrial public authority fire protection other including non metered accounts total customer water consumption millions of gallons residential commercial industrial public authority total connecticut water owns various small  discrete parcels of land that are no longer required for water supply purposes 
at december   this land totaled approximately acres 
over the past several years  we have been disposing of these land parcels 
for more information  please refer to segments of our business below 
additional information on land dispositions can be found in item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations commitments and contingencies 
competition connecticut water faces competition from a few small privately owned water systems operating within  or adjacent to  our franchise areas and from municipal and public authority systems whose service areas in some cases overlap portions of our franchise areas 
employees as of december   we employed a total of persons  an increase of employees over december  eight of these employees were added as a result of the birmingham acquisition 
our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 

table of contents segments of our business for management and financial reporting purposes we divide our business into three segments water activities  real estate transactions  and services and rentals 
water activities the water activities segment is comprised of our core regulated water activities to supply public drinking water to our customers 
this segment encompasses all transactions of our regulated water company with the exception of certain real estate transactions 
real estate transactions our real estate transactions segment involves the sale or donation for income tax benefits of our real estate holdings 
these transactions can be effected by any of our subsidiary companies 
during  the company did not engage in any land transactions 
currently  the company plans to complete one land transaction during  additional information can be found on page of this form k 
during  the company engaged in two land transactions totaling acres and increased its valuation allowance  resulting in a net profit of  in february  the company sold acres of land that were owned by barlaco to the town of barnstable  massachusetts for million 
in  the company reduced after tax profit by  by recording a reserve for income taxes 
this was due to an examination by the internal revenue service irs  which was examining the fair market value of the property reflected on the company s  and tax returns 
the irs completed its examination during and no adjustment to the company s tax liability was needed 
as a result  the reserve of  along with an additional  in reserves was reversed in a breakdown of the net income of this segment between our regulated and unregulated companies for the past three years is as follows income loss from real estate transactions from continuing operations regulated unregulated total services and rentals our services and rentals segment provides contracted services to water and wastewater utilities and other clients and also leases certain of our properties to third parties through our unregulated companies 
the types of services provided include contract operations of water and wastewater facilities  linebacker  our service line protection plan for public drinking water customers  and providing bulk deliveries of emergency drinking water to businesses and residences via tanker truck 
our lease and rental income comes primarily from the renting of residential and commercial property 
linebacker is an optional service line protection program offered by the company to eligible residential and commercial customers through newus covering the cost of repairs for leaking or broken water service lines which provide the drinking water to a customer s home or business 
for customers who enroll in this program  the company will repair or replace a leaking or broken water service line  curb box  curb box cover  meter pit  meter pit cover  meter pit valve plus in home water main shut off valve before the meter 
the program does not cover non standard items such as pressure reducing valves  booster pumps  and lawn and or fire sprinkler protection systems 
the linebacker program costs per year for residential customers and per year for commercial customers 
the program has no deductible or limits on number or cost of leaks repaired each year 
as of december  and  the company had  and  customers enrolled in its linebacker protection program  respectively 
some of the services listed above  including the service line protection plan  have little or no competition 
but there can be considerable competition for contract operations of large water and wastewater facilities and systems 
however  we have sought to develop a niche market by seeking to serve smaller facilities and systems in our service areas where there is less competition 
the services and rentals segment  while still a relatively small portion of our overall business  has grown significantly over the past five years and now provides approximately of our overall net income in net income generated by this segment of our business was   and  for the years  and  respectively 

table of contents item a 
risk factors our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth below  any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or anticipated future results 
for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  see the discussion in forward looking information in item below management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements 
because we incur significant capital expenditures annually  we depend on the rates we charge our customers 
the water utility business is capital intensive 
on an annual basis  we spend significant sums for additions to or replacement of property  plant and equipment 
our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is dependent upon the rates we charge our customers 
these rates are subject to approval by the dpuc 
the company is entitled to file rate increase requests  from time to time  to recover our investments in utility plant and expenses  however as part of our settlement agreement with the dpuc  we have agreed not to request rate relief that would become effective prior to january once a rate increase petition is filed with the dpuc  the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly 
the timing of our future rate increase requests are dependent on the terms of our rate case decision on january  and also partially dependent upon the estimated cost of the administrative process in relation to the investments and expenses that we hope to recover through the rate increase to the extent approved 
we can provide no assurances that any future rate increase requests will be approved by the dpuc  and  if approved  we cannot guarantee that any such rate increase requests will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase 
additionally  the dpuc may rule that a company must reduce its rates 
under a law  the dpuc may authorize regulated water companies to use a rate adjustment mechanism  known as a water infrastructure and conservation adjustment wica  for eligible projects completed and in service for the benefit of the customers 
the company has filed its iar and expects a ruling from the dpuc on its iar in the first quarter of the company does not expect to file for a surcharge under the wica mechanism until the second quarter of approximately days after the surcharge filing  customers would begin to see an increase in their bills 
for more information related to wica  please refer to the executive overview found in item of this form k 
if we are unable to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due  or we default under certain other provisions of our loan documents  our indebtedness could be accelerated and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance 
our performance is affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we believe that our cash generated from operations  and  if necessary  borrowing under our existing and planned credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to make our debt payments as they become due 
if  however  we do not generate sufficient cash  we may be required to refinance our obligations or sell additional equity  which may be on terms that are not favorable to the company as current terms 
no assurance can be given that any refinancing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms 
in addition  our failure to comply with certain provisions contained in our trust indentures and loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness could lead to a default on these documents  which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness 
credit market volatility may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt  borrow funds under our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt 
the credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than months 
in recent months  the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels 
in many cases  the markets have limited credit capacity for certain issuers  and lenders have requested shorter terms 
the market for new debt financing is limited and in some cases not available at all 
in addition  the markets have increased the uncertainty that lenders will be able to comply with their previous commitments 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  we may not be able to refinance our existing debt when it comes due  draw upon our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt  which may require us to seek other funding sources to meet our liquidity needs or to fund our capital expenditures budget 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or other financing on reasonable terms  or at all 
failure to maintain our existing credit ratings could affect our cost of funds and related margins and liquidity position 
since  standard poor s ratings services has rated our outstanding debt and has given credit ratings to us and our subsidiary the connecticut water company 
their evaluations are based on a number of factors  which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting 
on august   standard poor s ratings services raised the senior unsecured rating on connecticut water service to a from a and affirmed the a rating of the connecticut water company  our subsidiary  both with an outlook of stable 
in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the difficult financial markets  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current strong credit ratings 
failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins and liquidity position 

table of contents market disruptions caused by the worldwide financial crisis could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long term commitments  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on our revolving credit facility and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs 
further disruptions in the credit markets or further deterioration of the banking industry s financial condition  may discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments  extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments 
market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt securities in the capital markets 
the company has received approval from its board of directors to increase its line of credit to million from its current million 
the company expects to secure access to increased lines of credit by the end of the second quarter of our inability to comply with debt covenants under our credit facilities could result in prepayment obligations 
we are obligated to comply with debt covenants under some of our loan and debt agreements 
failure to comply with covenants under our credit facilities could result in an event of default  which if not cured or waived  could result in us being required to repay or finance these borrowings before their due date  could limit future borrowings  and result in cross default issues and increase borrowing costs 
the covenants are normal and customary in bank and loan agreements 
the company was in compliance with the covenants at december  market conditions may unfavorably impact the value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities which then could require significant additional funding 
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans and could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position 
as detailed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has significant obligations in these areas and the company holds significant assets in these trusts 
these assets are subject to market fluctuations  which may affect investment returns  which may fall below the company s projected return rates 
a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets  as was experienced in  will increase the funding requirements under the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value 
additionally  the company s pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as interest rates decrease  the liabilities increase  potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements 
further  changes in demographics  including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
also  future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable from our customers  and our the results of operations and financial position of the company could be negatively affected 
our operating costs could be significantly increased because of state and federal environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations  including the federal safe drinking water act  the clean water act and similar state laws  and federal and state regulations issued under these laws by the us environmental protection agency and state environmental regulatory agencies 
these laws and regulations establish  among other things  criteria and standards for drinking water and for discharges into the waters of the united states and or connecticut 
pursuant to these laws  we are required to obtain various environmental permits from environmental regulatory agencies for our operations 
we cannot assure that we have been or will be at all times in full compliance with these laws  regulations and permits 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
environmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently 
these laws  and the enforcement thereof  have tended to become more stringent over time 
while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and our permits  it is possible that new or stricter standards could be imposed that will raise our operating costs 
although these costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that the dpuc would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such costs 
in summary  we cannot be assured that our costs of complying with  or discharging liabilities under  current and future environmental and health and safety laws will not adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations which could affect demand for our water services and our revenues 
demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems  swimming pools  cooling systems and other outside water use 
throughout the year  and particularly during typically warmer months  demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels 
in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal  or if there is more rainfall than normal  the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 
in  the company s northern region experienced approximately double the rainfall when compared to  reducing per customer residential consumption 
declining per customer residential water usage may reduce our revenues  financial condition and results of operations in future years 
a trend of declining per customer residential water usage in connecticut has been observed for the last several years  which we would attribute to the declining household size reported throughout the state  as well as increased water conservation  including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential users 
our regulated business is heavily dependent on revenue generated from rates we charge to our residential customers for the volume of water they use 
the rate we charge for our water is regulated by the dpuc and we may not unilaterally adjust our rates to reflect changes in demand 
declining volume of residential water usage may  thus  have a negative impact on our operating revenues in the future if regulators do not reflect any usage declines in the rate setting design process 
potential regulatory changes or drought conditions may impact our ability to serve our current and future customers demand for water and our financial results 
we depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers 
changes in regulatory requirements could affect our ability to utilize existing supplies and or secure new sources  as required 
insufficient supplies or an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
although not occurring in  drought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our existing and future customers 
an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water  even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions  which may adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
the failure of  or the requirement to repair  upgrade or dismantle  any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we own and operate dams throughout the state of connecticut 
while the company maintains robust dam maintenance and inspection programs  a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and damage to residential and or commercial property downstream for which we may be responsible  in whole or in part 
the failure of a dam could also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
any losses or liabilities incurred due to the failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates  and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 
any failure of our reservoirs  storage tanks  mains or distribution networks could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 
connecticut water distributes water through an extensive network of mains and stores water in reservoirs and storage tanks located across connecticut 
a failure of major mains  reservoirs  or tanks could result in injuries and damage to residential and or commercial property for which we may be responsible  in whole or in part 
the failure of major mains  reservoirs or tanks may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our water distribution network in order to conduct repairs 
such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water delivery requirements prescribed by governmental regulators  including the dpuc  and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  liquidity and reputation 
any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates  and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 
any future acquisitions we may undertake may involve risks and uncertainties 
an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and integration of water systems in order to move into new service areas and to broaden our current service areas 
connecticut water has completed two acquisitions since the beginning of through the filing of this report on form k on march  the acquisitions of birmingham s eastern division and ellington acres water systems have increased the company s customer base by approximately  customers 
following these acquisitions  the connecticut water company now serves more than  customers  or a population of over  people  in more than connecticut towns 
we will not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates 
it is our intent  when practical  to integrate any businesses we acquire with our existing operations 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management s time and resources 
future acquisitions by us could result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  failure to have effective internal control over financial reporting  fluctuations in quarterly results  and other acquisition related expenses 

table of contents some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as our ability to finance our business and comply with regulatory requirements 
the businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve sales and profitability that would justify our investment and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process  including in the integration of controls necessary for internal control and financial reporting  could interfere with our operations  reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal controls 
in addition  as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries  the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions 
water supply contamination may adversely affect our business 
our water supplies are subject to contamination  including contamination from the development of naturally occurring compounds  chemicals in groundwater systems  pollution resulting from man made sources  such as mtbe  and possible terrorist attacks 
in the event that our water supply is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source or provide additional treatment 
we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
if we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost effective manner  there may be an adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates 
we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage 
for example  private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 
our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims 
the need to increase security may continue to increase our operating costs 
in addition to the potential pollution of our water supply as described above  in the wake of the september  terrorist attacks and the ongoing threats to the nation s health and security  we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply 
we have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business 
we have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities  operations and supplies 
these costs may be significant 
we are currently not aware of any specific threats to our facilities  operations or supplies  however  it is possible that we would not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur 
the accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition 
we make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding  among others the number of years to depreciate certain assets  amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory obsolesces and uninsured losses  our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims  including medical and workers compensation claims  future costs for pensions and other post retirement benefits  and  possible tax allowances 

table of contents the quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs at the end of each accounting period 
if our estimates are not accurate  we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period 
key employee turnover may adversely affect our operating results 
our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team 
the loss of the services of any member of our senior management team or the inability to hire and retain experienced management personnel could harm our operating results

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition executive overview the company is a non operating holding company  whose income is derived from the earnings of its four wholly owned subsidiary companies the connecticut water company connecticut water  new england water utility services  inc newus  chester realty company chester realty  and barnstable holding company barnstable holding 
in  approximately of the company earnings from continuing operations were attributable to the water activities of its largest subsidiary  connecticut water  a regulated water utility with  customers throughout connecticut towns  as of december  the rates charged for service by connecticut water are subject to review and approval by the connecticut department of public utility control dpuc 
in the mid s  connecticut water made a conscious decision to minimize its reliance on rate increase requests to drive its financial performance 
instead  it relied upon unregulated operations and cost containment to grow the earnings of the company without seeking higher rates 
after a successful extended period of meeting these objectives  it became clear in that a rate increase was needed to continue to provide shareholder value through increased earnings 
the company decided to return to the more traditional model of recurring rate increase filings to efficiently collect its cost of both annual expenses and its investment in the infrastructure of the regulated business 
in  the connecticut water communicated to its customers  regulators and shareholders that it expected to seek rate relief on a more recurring basis for amounts less than the that was requested in the filing 
currently  the company is precluded from increasing its customers base rates prior to january  the company has not determined when it will file for its next general rate increase 
over the next twenty years  the environmental protection agency expects water companies to spend over billion in infrastructure costs nationwide to ensure compliance with existing and future water regulations 
recognizing the importance of timely infrastructure replacement and improvement  the company  along with other investor owned regulated water companies in the state  campaigned for the passage of the water infrastructure and conservation adjustment wica act in the connecticut general assembly in wica allows the company to add a surcharge to customers bills  subject to an expedited review and approval by the dpuc and no more than twice a year  to reflect the replacement of certain types of aging utility plant  principally water mains  meters  service lines and water conservation related investments 
the company  however  does not expect to be able to file for a surcharge under the wica mechanism until the second quarter of the passage of the wica legislation will help augment the company s current strategy of seeking to collect its costs of operating the regulated utility on a timely basis through a mechanism even more efficient than a general rate filing with the dpuc 
the use of wica will help to eliminate the regulatory lag from the time the company invests in infrastructure replacement  or certain qualified new  plant and when it can begin to recover that investment in the rates charged to customers 
in october  the company filed with the dpuc its infrastructure assessment report iar required under the wica legislation 
the purpose of the iar is to clearly define the criteria for determining the priority of future replacement projects 
the first public hearing on the company s iar was held on january  the company expects a ruling on its iar from the dpuc in the first quarter of  after which the company would be eligible to file for its first surcharge under wica 
approximately days after the surcharge filing  customers would begin to see an increase in their bills 

table of contents the company has and will continue to focus on minimizing operating costs that are passed along to its customers without sacrificing the quality service it values and the customers demand 
at the same time  the company will continue to employ its current strategy of timely collection of appropriate costs and a fair rate of return for its shareholders through appropriate rates for its regulated water service 
following our successful acquisition and integration of the water utility assets of eastern connecticut regional water company eastern  which added over  customers  the company announced on july  that it had reached a definitive purchase agreement with ellington acres company ellington acres to purchase all of ellington acres outstanding stock for approximately million 
ellington acres is a regulated water company serving approximately customers in ellington and somers  connecticut  situated between two systems in the company s northern region that the company had planned to interconnect 
the company will be able to interconnect the two systems in the northern region with ellington acres  saving ratepayers of both connecticut water and ellington acres significant capital expenditures 
the dpuc approved the acquisition in december and the company completed the transaction on january  in and beyond  the company will continue to look for acquisition candidates that we would easily be able to tuck in to existing service territories  as well as possible acquisitions outside of our service territories  including outside the state of connecticut 
additionally  the company plans to continue its efforts to tie in private well owners whose homes are in close proximity to our mains 
in  connecticut water added private well owners in our existing service territories 
lastly  the company will continue to work with developers to encourage public water use for new residential construction within connecticut water s service areas 
while the company plans to file timely rate cases  continue to make acquisitions and  in the future  utilize the wica adjustment to increase its earnings through its regulated subsidiary  it will also look to newus to increase its earnings in the unregulated business 
as part of the company s january acquisition of eastern  newus acquired the operation and maintenance contracts of birmingham ho services inc  an unregulated business of birmingham that has nearly contracts for unregulated water systems in eastern connecticut  totaling approximately  in annual revenues 
the company will continue to seek out maintenance and service contracts with new customers and renew existing contracts that have proven to be beneficial to the company  as well as to continue the expansion of the linebacker program 
in  the company entered into negotiations with the town of windsor locks  connecticut to sell a conservation easement on a well field property no longer needed as a source of supply for million 
windsor locks was awarded a grant from the connecticut department of environmental protection to assist in purchasing the conservation easement in order to permanently protect the approximate acre property from development and guarantee public access to the land for passive recreation 
the purchase and sale agreement between the company and the town has not been executed as of the date of this filing 
the company expects to file an application with the dpuc and will submit the draft agreement and the form of conservation easement to the dpuc in march dpuc approval is expected in the second half of subject to successful receipt of dpuc approval  and of final authorization for the town to proceed with the transaction  the company expects the transaction to be completed in if the transaction closes  the company estimates that it will generate approximately million in net income in the real estate segment 
the company currently has no other specific plans for land transactions in and beyond 
regulatory matters and inflation the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve  and expand its service capabilities 
the cumulative effect of inflation over time results in significantly higher operating costs and facility replacement costs  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
connecticut water s ability to recover its increased expenses and or investment in utility plant is dependent on the rates we charge our customers 
changes to these rates must be approved by the dpuc through formal rate proceedings 
due to the subjectivity of certain items involved in the process of establishing rates such as customer usage  future customer growth  inflation  and allowed return on investment  we have no assurance that we will be able to raise our rates to a level we consider appropriate  or to raise rates at all  through any future rate proceeding 
connecticut water is also subject to environmental and water quality regulations  which are continually modified and refined to ensure the safety of the company s water sources and  ultimately  the public s health 
costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify current filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 
while there can be no guarantee that all expenditures related to increased regulation will be recoverable in rate proceedings  the company believes that the regulatory environment in connecticut would allow prudent expenditures to be recovered in rates 
to date  the company has never had any costs associated with water quality and environmental spending refused in a general rate proceeding 
the company believes that it is in compliance with current regulations  but the regulations are subject to change at any time 
during  the company incurred approximately million in capital expenditures on safe drinking water act projects 
the company expects to spend approximately million on safe water drinking act projects in  primarily to bring newly acquired systems up to the company s standards 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and as directed by the regulatory commissions to which the company s subsidiaries are subject 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the company believes the following policies and estimates are critical to the presentation of its consolidated financial statements 
public utility regulation statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas  requires cost based  rate regulated enterprises such as connecticut water to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their financial statements 
the state regulators  through the rate regulation process  can create regulatory assets that result when costs are allowed for ratemaking purposes in a period after the period in which costs would be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise 
the balance sheet includes regulatory assets and liabilities as appropriate  primarily related to income taxes and post retirement benefit costs 
the company believes  based on current regulatory circumstances  that the regulatory assets recorded are likely to be recovered and that its use of regulatory accounting is appropriate and in accordance with the provisions of sfas material regulatory assets  other than deferred revenue  are earning a return 
revenue recognition the company s accounting policies regarding revenue recognition by segment are as follows water activities most of our water customers are billed quarterly  with the exception of larger commercial and industrial customers  as well as public and private fire protection customers who are billed monthly 
most customers  except fire protection customers  are metered 
revenues from metered customers are based on their water usage multiplied by approved  regulated rates and are earned when water is delivered 
public fire protection revenues are based on the length of the water main  and number of hydrants in service and are earned on a monthly basis 
private fire protection charges are based on the diameter of the connection to the water main 
our water companies accrue an estimate for metered customers for the amount of revenues earned relating to water delivered but unbilled at the end of each quarter 
real estate transactions revenues are recorded when a sale or other transaction has been completed and title to the real estate has been transferred 
services and rentals revenues are recorded when the company has delivered the services called for by contractual obligation 
employee benefit plan accounting management evaluates the appropriateness of the discount rate through the modeling of a bond portfolio which approximates the pension and postretirement plan liabilities 
management further considers rates of high quality corporate bonds of approximate maturities as published by nationally recognized rating agencies consistent with the duration of the company s pension and postretirement plans 
the discount rate assumption we use to value our pension and postretirement benefit obligations has a material impact on the amount of expense we record in a given period 
our and pension and postretirement expense was calculated using assumed discount rates of and  respectively 
in  our pension and postretirement expense will be calculated using an assumed discount rate of and  respectively 
the following table shows how much a one percent change in our assumed discount rate would have changed our reported pension and postretirement expense increase decrease in pension expense increase decrease in postretirement expense increase in the discount rate decrease in the discount rate outlook the company s earnings and profitability are primarily dependent upon the sale and distribution of water  the amount of which is dependent on seasonal weather fluctuations  particularly during the summer months when water demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels 
the company s earnings and profitability in future years will also depend upon a number of other factors  such as the ability to maintain our operating costs at current or lower levels  customer growth in the company s core regulated water utility business  growth in revenues attributable to non water sales operations  and the timing and adequacy of rate relief when requested  from time to time  by our regulated water company 
the company believes that the factors described above and those described in detail below under the heading commitments and contingencies may have significant impact  either alone or in the aggregate  on the company s earnings and profitability in fiscal years and beyond 
please also review carefully the risks and uncertainties described in item a risk factors and those described below under the heading forward looking information 
based on the company s current projections  assuming normal weather patterns and appropriate regulatory treatment on recovery of infrastructure improvement  and the completion of the windsor locks land sale  the company believes that its net income from continuing operations for the year will increase from the levels reported for  primarily as a result of the second phase of the rate increase which was approved by the dpuc in march during and subsequent years  the ability of the company to maintain and increase its net income from continuing operations will principally depend upon the effect on the company of the factors described above in this outlook section  those factors described in the section entitled commitments and contingencies and the risks and uncertainties described in forward looking information and item a risk factors

they are secured by irrevocable direct pay letters of credit issued by a financial institution 
these bonds are currently remarketed on a weekly basis 
on october   the company was notified that there was a combined remarketing failure of million on two of these bonds

the company anticipates utilization of private activity bonds issued through the connecticut development authority cda  for long term debt issuance in and beyond  as approved by the board of directors 
in december  connecticut water borrowed million through the issuance of water facilities revenue bonds by the cda sold in a single series with an interest rate of five percent maturing on december  the proceeds from the sale of the bonds have been used to finance construction and installation of various capital improvements to the company s existing water system 
in connection with the issuance of the million variable rate bonds  connecticut water entered into an interest rate swap transaction with a counterparty in the notional principal amount of  the interest rate swap agreement provides that  beginning in april and thereafter on a monthly basis  connecticut water paid jp morgan  the counterparty  a fixed interest rate of on the notional amount for a period of five years  which expired on march  in exchange  the counterparty began in april and thereafter on a monthly basis  paying connecticut water a floating interest rate based on of the us dollar one month libor rate on the notional amount for a period of five years
