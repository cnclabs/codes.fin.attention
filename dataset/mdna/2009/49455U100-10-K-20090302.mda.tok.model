represents income from continuing operations per unit 
basic limited partners income per unit from continuing operations was computed by dividing the interest of our unitholders in income from continuing operations by the weighted average number of units outstanding during the period 
diluted limited partners income per unit from continuing operations reflects the maximum potential dilution that could occur if units whose issuance depends on the market price of the units at a future date were considered outstanding  or if  by application of the treasury stock method  options to issue units were exercised  both of which would result in the issuance of additional units that would then share in our net income 
represents the amount of cash distributions declared with respect to that year 
for the purpose of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  earnings are defined as income from continuing operations before income taxes  and before minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries  equity earnings including amortization of excess cost of equity investments and unamortized capitalized interest  plus fixed charges and distributed income of equity investees 
fixed charges are defined as the sum of interest on all indebtedness excluding capitalized interest  amortization of debt issuance costs and that portion of rental expense which we believe to be representative of an interest factor

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
additional sections in this report which should be helpful to the reading of our discussion and analysis include the following i a description of our business strategy found in items and business and properties c narrative description of business business strategy  ii a description of developments during  found in items and business and properties a general development of business recent developments  and iii a description of risk factors affecting us and our business  found in item a risk factors 
in addition to any uncertainties described in this discussion and analysis  our risk factors disclosure provides a more detailed description of a variety of risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
general our business model is built to support two principal components helping customers by providing energy  bulk commodity and liquids products transportation  storage and distribution  and creating long term value for our unitholders 
to achieve these objectives  we focus on providing fee based services to customers from a business portfolio consisting of energy related pipelines  bulk and liquids terminal facilities  and carbon dioxide and petroleum reserves 
our reportable business segments are based on the way our management organizes our enterprise  and each of our five segments represents a component of our enterprise that engages in a separate business activity and for which discrete financial information is available 
our five reportable business segments are products pipelines the ownership and operation of refined petroleum products pipelines that deliver gasoline  diesel fuel  jet fuel and natural gas liquids to various markets  plus the ownership and or operation of associated product terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix facilities  natural gas pipelines the ownership and operation of major interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage systems  co i the production  transportation and marketing of carbon dioxide  referred to as co  to oil fields that use co to increase production of oil  ii ownership interests in and or operation of oil fields in west texas  and iii the ownership and operation of a crude oil pipeline system in west texas  terminals the ownership and or operation of liquids and bulk terminal facilities and rail transloading and materials handling facilities located throughout the united states  and kinder morgan canada i the ownership and operation of the trans mountain pipeline system that transports crude oil and refined petroleum products from edmonton  alberta  canada to marketing terminals and refineries in british columbia  canada and the state of washington  and ii the interest in the express pipeline system and the jet fuel pipeline system we acquired from knight effective august  following the acquisition of these two businesses  the operations of our trans mountain  express and jet fuel pipeline systems have been combined to represent our kinder morgan canada segment 
as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the united states and canada s various energy businesses and markets  we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future 
many of our operations are regulated by various us and canadian regulatory bodies 
the profitability of our products pipeline transportation business is generally driven by the utilization of our facilities in relation to their capacity  as well as the prices we receive for our services 
transportation volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the petroleum products being shipped or stored  and the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index 
because of the overall effect of utilization on our products pipeline transportation business  we seek to own refined products pipelines located in  or that transport to  stable or growing markets and population centers 
with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines and related storage facilities  the revenues from these assets tend to be received under contracts with terms that are fixed for various periods of time 
to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors  we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms  with higher per unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity 
however  changes  either positive or negative  in actual quantities transported on our interstate natural gas pipelines may not accurately measure or predict associated changes in profitability because many of the underlying transportation contracts  sometimes referred to as take or pay contracts  specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available  whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity 
our co sales and transportation business  like our natural gas pipelines business  generally has take or pay contracts  although the contracts in our co business typically have minimum volume requirements 
in the long term  our success in this business is driven by the demand for co however  short term changes in the demand for co typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum transport volumes under many of our contracts 
in the oil and gas producing activities within our co business segment  we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that is added or the amount of declines in oil and gas production that are postponed 
in that regard  our production during any period and the reserves that we add during that period are important measures 
in addition  the revenues we receive from our crude oil  natural gas liquids and co sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products 
over the long term  we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products 
in the shorter term  however  published market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management  or hedging  program in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed  capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts  particularly for crude oil 
as with our pipeline transportation businesses  the profitability of our terminals businesses is generally driven by the utilization of our terminals facilities in relation to their capacity  as well as the prices we receive for our services  which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored 
the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals businesses in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts  the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported  and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time 
to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors  we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms  with higher per unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity 
in addition  weather related factors such as hurricanes  floods and droughts may impact our facilities and access to them and  thus  the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or  in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities  for longer periods 
in our discussions of the operating results of individual businesses which follow  we generally identify the important fluctuations between periods that are attributable to acquisitions and dispositions separately from those that are attributable to businesses owned in both periods 
we believe that we have a history of making accretive acquisitions and economically advantageous expansions of existing businesses 
our ability to increase earnings and increase distributions to our unitholders will  to some extent  be a function of completing successful acquisitions and expansions 
we continue to have opportunities for expansion of our facilities in many markets  and we expect to continue to have such opportunities in the future  although the level of such opportunities is difficult to predict 
our ability to make accretive acquisitions is a function of the availability of suitable acquisition candidates and  to some extent  our ability to raise necessary capital to fund such acquisitions  factors over which we have limited or no control 
thus  we have no way to determine the extent to which we will be able to identify accretive acquisition candidates  or the number or size of such candidates in the future  or whether we will complete the acquisition of any such candidates 
on november   we announced that we expect to declare cash distributions of per unit for  a increase over our cash distributions of per unit for our expected growth in distributions in assumes an average west texas intermediate crude oil price of per barrel in with some minor adjustments for timing  quality and location differences 
based on actual prices received through the first seven weeks of and the forward curve  adjusted for the same factors as the budget  our average realized price for is currently projected to be per barrel 
although the majority of the cash generated by our assets is fee based and is not sensitive to commodity prices  our co business segment is exposed to commodity price risk related to the price volatility of crude oil and natural gas liquids 
we hedge the majority of our crude oil production  but do have exposure to unhedged volumes  the majority of which are natural gas liquids volumes 
for  we expect that every change in the average wti crude oil price per barrel will impact our co segment s cash flows by approximately million or approximately of our combined business segments anticipated distributable cash flow 
this sensitivity to the average wti price is very similar to what we experienced in our cash distribution expectations do not take into account any capital costs associated with financing any payment we may be required to make of reparations sought by shippers on our pacific operations interstate pipelines 
basis of presentation as discussed in note of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements  our financial statements and the financial information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflect the august  transfer of both the interest in the express pipeline system net assets and the jet fuel pipeline system net assets from knight as of the date of transfer 
accordingly  we have included the financial results of the express and jet fuel pipeline systems within our kinder morgan canada business segment disclosures presented in this report for all periods subsequent to august  critical accounting policies and estimates accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates  and the application of generally accepted accounting principles involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities  our revenues and expenses during the reporting period and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we routinely evaluate these estimates  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  the fair values used to allocate purchase price and to determine possible asset impairment charges  reserves for environmental claims  legal fees  transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables  exposures under contractual indemnifications  and unbilled revenues 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others  which policies are discussed as follows 
environmental matters with respect to our environmental exposure  we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts 
we expense or capitalize  as appropriate  environmental expenditures that relate to current operations  and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs 
we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value  and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable 
our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action  but generally  we recognize and or adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations 
these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates 
these environmental liability adjustments are recorded pursuant to our management s requirement to recognize contingent environmental liabilities whenever the associated environmental issue is likely to occur and the amount of our liability can be reasonably estimated 
in making these liability estimations  we consider the effect of environmental compliance  pending legal actions against us  and potential third party liability claims 
for more information on our environmental disclosures  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
legal matters we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as a result of our business operations and transactions 
we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders  judgments or settlements 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates  our earnings will be affected 
in general  we expense legal costs as incurred 
when we identify specific litigation that is expected to continue for a significant period of time and require substantial expenditures  we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to litigate the matter to a conclusion or reach an acceptable settlement 
generally  if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount  we record a liability equal to the low end of the range 
any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available 
as of december   our most significant ongoing litigation proceedings involved our west coast products pipelines 
tariffs charged by certain of these pipeline systems are subject to certain proceedings at the ferc involving shippers complaints regarding the interstate rates  as well as practices and the jurisdictional nature of certain facilities and services 
generally  the interstate rates on our product pipeline systems are grandfathered under the energy policy act of unless substantially changed circumstances are found to exist 
to the extent substantially changed circumstances are found to exist  our west coast products pipeline operations may be subject to substantial exposure under these ferc complaints and could  therefore  owe reparations and or refunds to complainants as mandated by the ferc or the united states judicial system 
for more information on our ferc regulatory proceedings  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
intangible assets intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance 
we account for our intangible assets according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these accounting pronouncements introduced the concept of indefinite life intangible assets and provided that all identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives  including goodwill  will not be subject to regular periodic amortization 
such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite 
instead  the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
there have not been any significant changes in these policies and estimates during  however  during the second quarter of  we changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment test date to may of each year from january  and we have determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of may  although our change to a new testing date  when applied to prior periods  does not yield different financial statement results  this change constitutes a change in the method of applying an accounting principle  as discussed in paragraph of sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
for more information on this change  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
as of december  and  our goodwill was  million and  million  respectively 
included in our december  goodwill balance is million related to our trans mountain pipeline system  which we acquired from knight on april  following the provisions of generally accepted accounting principles  this transaction caused knight to consider the fair value of the trans mountain pipeline system and to determine whether goodwill related to these assets was impaired 
knight recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the first quarter of this impairment is also reflected on our books due to the accounting principles for transfers of assets between entities under common control  which require us to account for trans mountain as if the transfer had taken place on january  our remaining intangible assets  excluding goodwill  include customer relationships  contracts and agreements  technology based assets and lease value 
these intangible assets have definite lives  are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and are reported separately as other intangibles  net in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  these intangibles totaled million and million  respectively 
for more information on our goodwill and other intangible assets  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities 
the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved reserves  both developed and undeveloped 
the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect  among other things  whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed  the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities 
the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties also rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of proved reserves may change  either positively or negatively  as additional information becomes available and as contractual  economic and political conditions change 
hedging activities we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates  and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives 
however  the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are complex  and even when we engage in hedging transactions that are effective economically  these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes 
according to the provisions of current accounting standards  to be considered effective  changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged 
a perfectly effective hedge is one in which changes in the value of the derivative contract exactly offset changes in the value of the hedged item or expected cash flow of the future transactions in reporting periods covered by the derivative contract 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately  accordingly  our financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges 
in addition  it is not always possible for us to engage in a hedging transaction that completely mitigates our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices 
for example  when we purchase a commodity at one location and sell it at another  we may be unable to hedge completely our exposure to a differential in the price of the product between these two locations 
even when we cannot enter into a completely effective hedge  we often enter into hedges that are not completely effective in those instances where we believe to do so would be better than not hedging at all  but because that the part of the hedging transaction that is not effective in offsetting undesired changes in commodity prices the ineffective portion is required to be recognized currently in earnings  our financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge 
hurricanes and fires in september  two hurricanes struck the gulf coast communities of southern texas and louisiana and a third hurricane made us landfall near the south carolina north carolina border 
the three named hurricanes hanna  gustav  and ike caused wide spread damage to residential and commercial property  but our primary assets in those areas experienced only relatively minor damage 
our terminals  products pipelines  natural gas pipelines and co business segments were negatively impacted by these hurricanes and we realized a combined million decrease in net income due to incremental expenses associated with the clean up and asset damage from these storms but excluding estimates for lost business and lost revenues 
this decrease is described in the footnotes to the tables below 
additionally  in the third quarter of  we experienced fire damage at three separate terminal locations 
the largest was an explosion and fire at our pasadena  texas liquids terminal facility on september  the fire primarily damaged a manifold system used for liquids distribution 
we intend to repair the damaged portions of each separate terminal facility  and we recognized a combined million decrease in net income from our terminals business segment due to incremental expenses and asset damage associated with these fires excluding estimates for lost business and lost revenues 
this decrease is described in the footnotes to the tables below

for more information on this acquisition and the goodwill impairment  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses because our partnership agreement requires us to distribute of our available cash to our partners on a quarterly basis available cash as defined in our partnership agreement generally consists of all our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and changes in reserves  we consider each period s earnings before all non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  including amortization of excess cost of equity investments  to be an important measure of our success in maximizing returns to our partners 
we also use segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses defined in the table above and sometimes referred to in this report as ebda internally as a measure of profit and loss used for evaluating segment performance and for deciding how to allocate resources to our five reportable business segments 
as a result of internal growth and expansion across our business portfolio  as well as incremental contributions from asset acquisitions  our total segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million in  when compared to the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above including the goodwill impairment expense accounted for million of the overall increase combining to decrease segment ebda by million in and to decrease segment ebda by million in 
the remaining million increase in year to year segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization resulted from incremental earnings from our co  natural gas pipelines  terminals and kinder morgan canada business segments 
specifically  in  we benefitted from higher revenues from crude oil and carbon dioxide sales  the start up of the rockies express west natural gas pipeline  improved margins from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group  incremental earnings from expanded bulk and liquids terminal operations  and a full year impact of trans mountain and its expansions 
the overall increase in our earnings compared to last year was tempered by such factors as i a continued slowing economy  ii the negative impact of higher energy prices primarily in the first three quarters on demand for petroleum products which negatively impacted our deliveries of gasoline  diesel and jet fuel in  iii increases in average construction and fuel costs which negatively impacted both our capital expansion programs and our existing operations when compared to  iv a weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar and primarily since the end of the third quarter of  and v lower crude oil  natural gas liquids and natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of in light of the economic uncertainties we are taking cost reduction measures for we are reducing our travel costs and compensation costs  decreasing the use of outside consultants  reducing overtime where possible and reviewing capital and operating budgets to identify the costs we can reduce without compromising operating efficiency  maintenance or safety

we accounted for our north system business as a discontinued operation pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles which require that our income statement be formatted to separate the divested business from our continuing operations  however  as discussed above  because the sale of our north system does not change the structure of our internal organization in a manner that causes a change to our reportable business segments  we have included the north system s operating results within our products pipelines business segment disclosures for all periods presented in this discussion and analysis 
this decision was based on the way our management organizes segments internally to make operating decisions and assess performance 
our north system generated million of earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in prior to the effective sale date of october  in addition  we recognized a million gain on disposal of the north system in the fourth quarter of we also recorded incremental gain adjustments of million in the gains  unlike the earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  are not reflected in the operating results above

for information on our reconciliation of segment information with our consolidated general purpose financial statements  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the decrease in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from our pacific operations in compared to was primarily due to an increase in system wide operating and maintenance expenses 
the increase primarily reflects lower product gains in  due both to lower physical gains and to the impact of unfavorable changes in diesel fuel versus gasoline prices  lower capitalized overhead credits  due to lower capital spending in  higher labor and payroll expenses due to an increase in headcount  and incremental expenses associated with litigation and right of way liability adjustments 
total revenues earned by our pacific operations in were essentially flat compared to  as higher pipeline delivery revenues were largely offset by lower fee based terminal revenues 
the year over year increase in refined products delivery revenues resulted from both higher average tariff rates in and a more favorable delivery mix of higher rate east line volumes versus lower rate west line volumes 
the increase was offset by decreases of and  respectively  in gasoline and diesel fuel delivery volumes  relative to last year  as us gasoline and diesel demand has trailed year earlier levels 
the decrease in earnings from our equity investment in plantation was due to lower overall net income earned by plantation pipe line company  mainly due to lower product transportation and pipeline service revenues 
for the year  pipeline throughput volumes dropped compared to the previous year 
the drop in delivery volumes was due to a combination of decreased demand due to lower product consumption  supply disruptions caused by hurricane related refinery outages  and a volume shift by customers to competing pipelines 
when compared to last year  our products pipelines business segment benefitted from higher earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses from our southeast terminal operations  our cochin and central florida pipeline systems  and our west coast terminal operations 
the improved performances from our southeast and west coast terminal operations were primarily related to higher margins on liquids inventory sales  increased earnings from incremental terminal throughput and storage activity at higher rates  and incremental returns from the completion of a number of capital expansion projects that modified and upgraded terminal infrastructure  enabling us to provide additional terminal and ethanol related services to our customers 
we continue to invest in projects that have now added ethanol storage and blending capabilities to six separate terminal facilities included in our southeast terminal operations  and we are currently in the process of securing commercial commitments to support the installation of ethanol handling infrastructure at our remaining southeast terminals 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we completed construction of four new fuel storage tanks with a combined capacity of  barrels at two military bases in the state of california 
the increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses from our cochin pipeline was driven largely by a year end reduction in income tax expense  related to lower canadian operating results in and to canadian income tax liability adjustments 
the decrease in income tax expense more than offset a year over year drop in operating revenues that was primarily related to lower pipeline transportation revenues 
the decrease in delivery revenues was due both to a continued decrease in demand for propane in eastern canadian and midwestern us petrochemical and fuel markets since the end of and to cochin s ceasing of ethane transportation in july the increase in earnings from our central florida pipeline was chiefly revenue related  driven by incremental ethanol terminal revenues that began in april and by incremental ethanol pipeline transportation revenues that began in october the increase in revenues was also related to higher product delivery revenues  driven by an increase in the average tariff as a result of a mid year tariff rate increase on product deliveries 
for all segment assets combined  revenues for from refined petroleum products deliveries increased a slight  but total volumes delivered fell  when compared to compared to last year  the segment s volumes were negatively impacted by reductions in demand  driven primarily by higher crude oil and refined product prices and weaker economic conditions  and partly by lost business associated with hurricanes in the third quarter of the decrease in delivery volumes included an drop in gasoline volumes  a drop in diesel fuel volumes  and a decline in total jet fuel volumes 
excluding deliveries by plantation pipeline  total segment revenues from refined petroleum products deliveries increased in  when compared to last year  and total refined products delivery volumes decreased 
although plantation sustained no hurricane damage in  the pipeline system pumped reduced volumes in the third quarter of due to hurricane induced refinery shut downs and to extended delays in restarting certain refineries impacted by the hurricanes 
all of the assets in our products pipelines business segment produced higher earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in than in the overall increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to was driven largely by incremental earnings from our cochin pipeline system 
the higher earnings and revenues from cochin were largely attributable to our january  acquisition of the remaining approximate ownership interest that we did not already own 
upon closing of the transaction  we became the operator of the pipeline 
for more information on this acquisition  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
other increases in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with included the following an increase from our west coast terminal operations due mainly to higher operating revenues  lower operating expenses and incremental gains from asset sales 
the increases in terminal revenues were driven by higher throughput volumes from our combined carson los angeles harbor terminal system  and from our linnton and willbridge terminals located in portland  oregon 
the increase in volumes at our carson terminal was partly due to completed storage expansion projects since the end of the decrease in operating expenses was largely related to higher environmental expenses recognized in  due to adjustments to accrued environmental liabilities  an increase from our approximate equity investment in plantation pipe line company due to higher overall net income earned by plantation  largely resulting from both higher pipeline revenues and lower year to year operating expenses 
the increase in revenues was largely due to a higher oil loss allowance percentage in  relative to  and the drop in operating expenses was due to decreases in both refined products delivery volumes and pipeline integrity expenses  an increase from our petroleum pipeline transmix operations reflecting incremental revenues from our greensboro  north carolina transmix facility and higher processing revenues from our colton  california facility 
we constructed and placed into service our greensboro facility in may  and the increases in earnings and revenues from our colton facility  which processes transmix generated from volumes transported to the southern california and arizona markets by our pacific operations pipelines  were primarily due to a year to year increase in average processing contract rates  an increase from our pacific operations largely revenue related  attributable to increases in both products transportation volumes and average tariff rates 
combined mainline delivery and terminal revenues increased in  compared to  due largely to higher delivery volumes to arizona  the completed expansion of our east line pipeline during the summer of  and higher deliveries to various west coast military bases  an increase from our calnev pipeline driven by higher year over year revenues  due to increased military and commercial tariff rates in  and higher terminal revenues associated with ethanol blending at our las vegas terminal that more than offset a drop in refined products delivery volumes  and an increase from our southeast terminal operations driven by higher overall liquids throughput volumes  and an increase from our north system mainly due to lower combined operating expenses  due to its sale in the fourth quarter of the decline in expense was greater than the associated decline in revenue 
combining all of the segment s operations  while revenues from refined petroleum products deliveries increased in  compared to the prior year  total refined products delivery volumes decreased 
gasoline delivery volumes decreased primarily due to plantation  while diesel and jet fuel volumes were up and  respectively  in versus excluding plantation  which continued to be impacted by a competing pipeline that began service in mid  total refined products delivery volumes increased by in  when compared to volumes on our pacific operations and our central florida pipelines were up and  respectively  in  and while natural gas liquids delivery volumes were down in versus  revenues were up substantially due to our increased ownership in the cochin pipeline system

we account for our investment in rockies express under the equity method of accounting  and the increase in our equity earnings reflects higher net income earned in by rockies express  primarily due to the start up of service on the rockies express west pipeline segment in january and may the rockies express pipeline began limited interim service in the first quarter of on its westernmost segment the line that extends from meeker  colorado to wamsutter  wyoming  and the million decrease in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from rockies express in reflected lower net income  when compared to  due primarily to incremental depreciation and interest expense allocable to another segment of the pipeline that was placed in service in february and  until the completion of the rockies express west project  had limited natural gas reservation revenues and volumes 
the segment realized increases in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in both and from strong year over year performances from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group  which includes the operations of the following four natural gas pipeline systems kinder morgan tejas including kinder morgan border pipeline  kinder morgan texas pipeline  kinder morgan north texas pipeline and our mier monterrey mexico pipeline 
the higher earnings in both and  when compared to the respective prior years  were primarily due to higher sales margins on renewal and incremental sales contracts  increased transportation revenues from higher volumes and rates  greater value from natural gas storage activities  and higher natural gas processing margins 
the earnings improvement in both years from higher natural gas sales margins reflected more favorable market conditions and year over year customer growth 
the increases in earnings from transportation and storage activities in both and were partly driven by incremental natural gas transport and fee based storage revenues due to a long term contract with one of the group s largest customers that became effective april  the increases in gas processing margins were largely due to more favorable price changes in natural gas liquids relative to the price of natural gas 
with regard to natural gas sales activity  our intrastate group s business strategy involves relying both on long and short term natural gas sales and purchase agreements  however  the spot market activity of our texas intrastate group  which involves purchasing and selling natural gas under short term commitments at a single volume price  gives us greater flexibility to balance supply and demand in order to react to changing market conditions 
furthermore  our spot market transactions can often be accomplished under contract terms that are less complex than traditional long term arrangements and allow us to take advantage of the large concentration of buyers and sellers as pipeline interconnections located close to a large consuming region the state of texas 
we use this flexibility with regard to our natural gas sales activities to help optimize the margins we realize by capturing favorable differences due to changes in timing  location  prices and volumes 
generally  we attempt to lock in an acceptable margin by capturing the difference between our average gas sales prices and our average gas purchase and cost of fuel prices 
because our intrastate group buys and sells significant quantities of natural gas  the variances from period to period in both segment revenues and segment operating expenses which include natural gas costs of sales are partly due to changes in our intrastate group s average prices and volumes for natural gas purchased and sold 
to the extent possible  we balance the pricing and timing of our natural gas purchases to our natural gas sales  and these contracts are frequently settled in terms of an index price for both purchases and sales 
in order to minimize commodity price risk  we attempt to balance sales with purchases at the index price on the date of settlement

combined  the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above account for a million decrease in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses ebda between and  and million of the million increase in ebda between and the items also account for a million increase in revenues between and for each of the segment s two primary businesses  following is information related to the remaining changes in i earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  and ii operating revenues in both and  when compared to the respective prior year year ended december  versus year ended december  ebda revenues increase decrease increase decrease in millions  except percentages sales and transportation activities oil and gas producing activities intrasegment eliminations total co year ended december  versus year ended december  ebda revenues increase decrease increase decrease in millions  except percentages sales and transportation activities oil and gas producing activities intrasegment eliminations total co the segment s overall million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in  when compared to  was driven almost evenly by higher earnings from its carbon dioxide sales and transportation activities and its oil and gas producing activities 
the earnings increase was largely revenue related  driven by increased crude oil  carbon dioxide  and natural gas liquids sales revenues  due primarily to increases in average crude oil which also impacts the price of carbon dioxide and natural gas plant product prices during the first three quarters of generally  earnings for the segment s oil and gas producing activities  which include the operations associated with its ownership interests in oil producing fields and natural gas processing plants  are closely aligned with our realized price levels for crude oil and natural gas liquids products 
revenues from crude oil sales and natural gas plant products sales increased million and million  respectively  in compared to  driven by increases of and  respectively  in the realized weighted average price per barrel 
crude oil sales volumes increased in  when compared to last year  but natural gas liquids sales volumes dropped in  due primarily to the effects from hurricane ike  and in part to operational issues on a third party owned pipeline  which resulted in pro rationing production allocation 
hurricane ike  which made landfall at galveston  texas  on september   temporarily shut down third party fractionation facilities  which caused a decline in liquids production volumes in and around the permian basin area through the end of november 
because prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids are subject to external factors over which we have no control  and because future price changes may be volatile  our co segment is exposed to commodity price risk related to the price volatility of crude oil and natural gas liquids 
to some extent  we are able to mitigate this risk through a long term hedging strategy that is intended to generate more stable realized prices by using derivative contracts as hedges to the exposure of fluctuating expected future cash flows produced by changes in commodity sales prices 
nonetheless  decreases in the prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids will have a negative impact on the results of our co business segment 
all of our hedge gains and losses for crude oil and natural gas liquids are included in our realized average price for oil 
had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk  our crude oil sales prices would have averaged per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in for more information on our hedging activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the year over year increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from the segment s sales and transportation activities in was driven by a million increase in carbon dioxide sales revenues and a million increase in carbon dioxide and crude oil pipeline transportation revenues 
the increase in carbon dioxide sales revenues was driven by a increase in average sales prices and a increase in average sales volumes  when compared to the increase in total pipeline transportation revenues was chiefly due to a increase in carbon dioxide delivery volumes in  relative to last year 
the increase in average carbon dioxide sales prices reflect continued customer demand for carbon dioxide for use in oil recovery projects throughout the permian basin area and  in addition  a portion of our carbon dioxide contracts are tied to crude oil prices  which as discussed above  have increased since the end of we do not recognize profits on carbon dioxide sales to ourselves 
the increases in carbon dioxide sales and delivery volumes were largely due to the january  start up of the doe canyon carbon dioxide source field located in dolores county  colorado 
we hold an approximately working interest in doe canyon 
since july  we have invested approximately million to develop this source field 
in addition  investments were also made to drill additional carbon dioxide wells at the mcelmo dome unit  increase transportation capacity on the cortez pipeline  and extend the cortez pipeline to the new doe canyon deep unit 
the overall million increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in versus was driven by higher earnings from the segment s oil and gas producing activities 
the increase was largely due to higher oil production at the yates oil field unit  higher realized average oil prices in relative to  and higher earnings from natural gas liquids sales  largely due to increased recoveries at the snyder  texas gas plant and to an increase in our realized weighted average price per barrel 
the year to year decrease in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from the segment s sales and transportation activities in was primarily due to a decrease in carbon dioxide sales revenues  resulting mainly from lower average prices for carbon dioxide  and partly from a drop in carbon dioxide sales volumes 
the segment s average price received for all carbon dioxide sales decreased in  when compared to the decrease was mainly attributable to the expiration of a significant high priced sales contract in december the million increase in segment revenues in  when compared to  was mainly due to higher revenues from the segment s oil and gas producing activities natural gas liquids and crude oil sales 
combined  plant product and crude oil sales revenues increased million in compared to the increase in revenues from the sales of natural gas liquids and crude oil was driven by favorable sales price variances our realized weighted average price per barrel for liquids products increased in  relative to  and our average crude oil realization increased in compared to the prior year 
plant product liquids volumes also increased  but total crude oil sales volumes decreased in compared to  largely due to a decline in gross production at the sacroc field unit 
the decline in crude oil production at sacroc was mainly attributable to lower observed recoveries from certain project areas and partly attributable to an intentional slow down in development pace  given this reduction in recoveries

beginning with our acquisition of the vancouver wharves bulk marine terminal on may  and including  among others  the terminal assets we acquired from marine terminals  inc effective september   we have invested approximately million in cash to acquire both terminal assets and equity interests in terminal operations  and combined  these acquired operations accounted for incremental earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  revenues of million  equity earnings of million  and operating expenses of million in in  we also benefitted significantly from the incremental contributions attributable to the bulk and liquids terminal businesses we acquired during and combined  these acquired operations accounted for incremental amounts of earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  revenues of million  operating expenses of million and equity earnings of million  respectively  in all of the incremental and amounts listed above represent the earnings  revenues and expenses from acquired terminals operations during the additional months of ownership in and  respectively  and do not include increases or decreases during the same months we owned the assets in the respective prior year 
for more information on our acquisitions  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
for all other terminal operations those owned during identical periods in both pairs of comparable years  earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses increased million in  and million in  when compared to the respective prior years 
the increases in earnings represent net changes in terminal results at various locations  and the million year over year increase in compared to for terminal operations owned during identical periods in both years included the following a million increase from our gulf coast terminal facilities  primarily our two large liquids terminal facilities located along the houston ship channel in pasadena and galena park  texas 
the increase was due mainly to higher liquids throughput volumes and increased liquids storage capacity as a result of expansions completed since the end of  a million increase from our mid atlantic terminals  primarily our pier ix bulk terminal located in newport news  virginia  due to higher period over period coal transfer volumes  and our fairless hills  pennsylvania bulk terminal  largely due to incremental earnings from a new import fertilizer facility that began operations in the second quarter of the increases in coal throughput at pier ix were largely due to an almost million capital improvement project  completed in the first quarter of  that involved the construction of a new ship dock and the installation of additional terminal equipment 
the import fertilizer facility at fairless hills cost approximately million to build  and included the construction of two storage domes  conveying equipment  and outbound loading facilities for both rail and truck  a million increase from our northeast terminals  largely due to higher earnings from our new york harbor liquids terminals  which include our perth amboy  new jersey terminal  our carteret  new jersey terminal  and our kinder morgan staten island terminal 
the year over year increase in earnings from these terminals was driven by a combined increase in liquids throughput volumes resulting both from incremental business driven by strong demand for imported fuel and from tank expansions completed since the end of  higher transfer and storage rates  and incremental revenues from ancillary terminal services  and a million increase from our west region terminals  mainly from our vancouver wharves bulk marine terminal and from our kinder morgan north terminal  a crude oil tank farm located in edmonton  alberta  canada 
we announced the construction of the north terminal in june  and we completed construction and began terminal operations in the second quarter of the increase from vancouver wharves was due largely to higher terminal revenues from liquids throughput and handling services 
the million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to from terminal operations owned during identical periods in both years was largely due to the following a million increase from our two liquids terminal facilities located in pasadena and galena park  texas 
the two terminals benefitted from both completed expansions that added new liquids tank and truck loading rack capacity since the end of and incremental business from ethanol and biodiesel storage and transfer activity 
for the entire terminals segment combined  our expansion projects and acquisitions completed since the end of increased our liquids terminals leaseable capacity by in  more than offsetting a less than drop in our overall utilization percentage  a million increase from the combined operations of our argo and chicago  illinois liquids terminals  due to increased ethanol throughput and incremental liquids storage and handling business  a million increase from our texas petcoke terminals  due largely to higher petroleum coke throughput volumes in at our port of houston facility  a million increase from our pier ix bulk terminal  chiefly due to a year to year increase in coal transfer volumes and higher rail incentives  and a million decrease from our lower river louisiana terminals  primarily due to both lower revenues from our interest in the international marine terminals partnership facility  a multi product bulk terminal located in sulphur springs  louisiana  and to higher income tax expense accruals 
the decrease in revenues from imt was mainly due to lower tonnage volumes and lower ship dockage revenues in  and the increase in income tax expense was largely due to higher taxable income attributable to kinder morgan bulk terminals  inc  our tax paying subsidiary that owns many of our louisiana bulk terminal businesses which handle non qualifying products

after taking into effect the certain items described in footnotes to the table above  the remaining increases in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization totaled million in versus  and million in versus the increase related entirely to our acquisition of trans mountain effective april   and the increase consisted of i higher earnings of million from the trans mountain pipeline assets we owned in the same periods in both years may through december  and ii incremental earnings of million from periods we owned assets in only trans mountain for the period january through april  and express and jet fuel for the period september through december 
the million increase in earnings from assets owned during the same periods in both and was driven primarily by higher operating revenues  due largely to the completion of the trans mountain pipeline anchor loop expansion project discussed elsewhere in this report 
the anchor loop project boosted pipeline capacity from  to  barrels per day and resulted in higher period to period average toll rates 
the higher tariffs became effective in june  and more than offset an decline in mainline throughput volumes  which resulted primarily from lower demand for water borne exports out of vancouver  british columbia

amount includes i a million increase in expense  allocated to us from knight  associated with closing the going private transaction we do not have any obligation  nor do we expect to pay any amounts related to this expense  ii a million expense related to trans mountain expenses for periods prior to our acquisition date of april   iii a million expense due to the adjustment of certain insurance related liabilities  iv a million increase in expense associated with the hurricane season  v a million expense for certain trans mountain acquisition costs  and vi a million expense related to the cancellation of certain commercial insurance policies

b amount includes i a million decrease in interest expense from the amounts previously reported in our fourth quarter earnings release issued on january   due to certain non cash trans mountain regulatory accounting adjustments  ii a million increase in imputed interest expense related to our january  cochin pipeline acquisition  and iii a million increase in interest expense related to the proposed settlement of certain litigation matters related to our pacific operations east line pipeline 
amount includes a million increase in expense related to imputed interest on our cochin pipeline acquisition  and a million expense for trans mountain expenses for periods prior to our acquisition date of april  amount includes trans mountain expenses of million 
c  and amounts include a million decreases in expense  a million decrease in expense  and a million increase in expense  respectively  related to the minority interest effect from all of the  and items previously disclosed in the footnotes to the tables included in results of operations 
items not attributable to any segment include general and administrative expenses  unallocable interest income and income tax expense  interest expense and minority interest 
overall  our total general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to  and million in compared to however  the certain items described in footnote a to the tables above resulted in a combined million decrease in expense in compared to  and a combined million increase in expense in compared to the remaining million and million increases in general and administrative expenses in and were largely due to i higher compensation related expenses comprising salary and benefit expenses  payroll taxes and other employee and contractor related expenses  and ii higher shared corporate services expenses including legal services  corporate secretary  tax  human resources  information technology and other shared services 
these increases in administrative expenses were associated with our larger year over year asset base and included incremental expenses and higher corporate overhead associated with the assets and operations we have acquired since the end of  including the trans mountain  express one third interest and jet fuel pipeline systems we acquired from knight  and the acquired bulk and liquids terminal operations that are described above in terminals 
acquiring assets and supporting internal growth initiatives result in increased spending levels and expenses  however  we continue to manage aggressively our infrastructure expenses in order to operate our assets in the most efficient manner possible 
unallocable interest expense  net of interest income  increased million less than in compared to  and million in compared to the certain items described in footnote b to the tables above decreased interest expense by million in and decreased interest expense by million in  when compared to the respective prior year periods 
the remaining million increase in expense in compared to was driven by a increase in average borrowings excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements  partially offset by a drop in our weighted average interest rate 
the decrease in our weighted average borrowing rate in reflects a general decrease in variable interest rates since the end of last year the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings was approximately during and during the remaining million increase in interest expense in compared to was due to both higher average debt levels and higher effective interest rates 
in  average borrowings increased and the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings increased from in to in the year over year increases in our average borrowings was largely due to the capital spending for asset expansion and improvement projects  including additional pipeline construction costs and the external business acquisitions we have made since the end of generally  we initially fund both our discretionary capital spending including payments for pipeline project construction costs and our acquisition outlays from borrowings under our commercial paper program or our long term revolving bank credit facility 
from time to time  we issue senior notes and equity in order to refinance our commercial paper borrowings 
for more information on our capital expansion and acquisition expenditures  see liquidity and capital resources investing activities 
as of december   approximately of our  million consolidated debt balance excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements was subject to variable interest rates either as short term or long term variable rate debt obligations or as fixed rate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps 
as of december   approximately of our  million consolidated debt balance was subject to variable interest rates 
the incremental unallocable income tax expense  in both and  relates to higher year to year corporate income tax accruals for the texas margin tax  an entity level tax initiated january  and imposed on the amount of our total revenue that is apportioned to the state of texas 
minority interest  which represents the deduction in our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our operating limited partnerships and their consolidated subsidiaries that are not held by us  increased in and decreased in  when compared to the respective prior year 
both the increase  in  and the drop  in  was due to overall lower partnership income in  relative to both and liquidity and capital resources general as of december   we believe our balance sheet and liquidity positions remained strong 
cash on hand was million at the close of the year  and on december   we demonstrated our continued access to the term debt market by issuing million in senior notes that mature on february  also in december  we took advantage of the general decrease in variable interest rates since the start of the year by terminating two of our existing fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements  and we received combined proceeds of million from the early termination of these swap agreements we terminated a third swap agreement in january and received additional proceeds of million 
similarly  we demonstrated continued access to the equity market by raising million in cash from the public offering of  additional common units on december  in addition  our diverse set of energy assets generated  million in cash from operations in  and based on long term contracted customer commitments and current cost estimates  we expect to realize incremental returns from completed capital expansion projects that are currently in process 
we also had  at december   billion of borrowing capacity available under our billion bank credit facility discussed below in short term liquidity and  at knight s third quarter board meeting on october   knight s board indicated its willingness to contribute up to million of equity to us over the subsequent months  if necessary  in order to support our capital raising efforts 
our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are debt service  sustaining capital expenditures defined as capital expenditures which do not increase the capacity of an asset  expansion capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholder and general partner 
in addition to utilizing cash generated from operations  we could meet our cash requirements for expansion capital expenditures through borrowings under our credit facility  issuing long term notes or additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr with the proceeds from issuances of additional kmr shares 
in general  we expect to fund cash distributions and sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash and cash flows from operating activities  expansion capital expenditures and working capital deficits with retained cash resulting from including i units in the determination of cash distributions per unit but paying quarterly distributions on i units in additional i units rather than cash  additional borrowings  the issuance of additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr  interest payments with cash flows from operating activities  and debt principal payments with additional borrowings  as such debt principal payments become due  or by the issuance of additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr 
credit ratings and capital market liquidity as part of our financial strategy  we try to maintain an investment grade credit rating  which involves  among other things  the issuance of additional limited partner units in connection with our acquisitions and internal growth activities in order to maintain acceptable financial ratios 
as a publicly traded limited partnership  our common units are attractive primarily to individual investors  although such investors represent a small segment of the total equity capital market 
we believe that some institutional investors prefer shares of kmr over our common units due to tax and other regulatory considerations  and we are able to access this segment of the capital market through kmr s purchases of i units issued by us with the proceeds from the sale of kmr shares to institutional investors 
on may   standard poor s rating services and moody s investors service each placed our long term credit ratings on credit watch pending the resolution of kmi s going private transaction 
on january   in anticipation of the going private transaction closing  s p downgraded us one level to bbb and removed our rating from credit watch with negative implications 
as previously noted by moody s in its credit opinion dated november   it downgraded our credit rating from baa to baa on may   following the closing of the going private transaction 
additionally  our rating was downgraded by fitch ratings from bbb to bbb on april  currently  our long term corporate debt credit rating is bbb  baa and bbb  respectively  at s p  moody s and fitch 
on september   lehman brothers holdings inc filed for bankruptcy protection under the provisions of chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
one lehman entity was a lending institution that provided a portion of our  rockies express  and mid continent express respective credit facilities 
since lehman brothers declared bankruptcy  its affiliate  which is a party to the aforementioned credit facilities  has not met its obligations to lend under those agreements 
as such  the commitments have been effectively reduced by million  million  and million  respectively  to billion  billion  and billion 
the commitments of the other banks remain unchanged  and the facilities are not defaulted 
on october   s p revised its outlook on our long term credit rating to negative from stable but affirmed our long term credit rating at bbb  due to our previously announced expected delay and cost increases associated with the completion of the rockies express pipeline project 
at the same time  s p lowered our short term credit rating to a from a as a result  we no longer have access to the commercial paper market 
however  we believe that our billion credit facility is adequate to meet our short term liquidity needs 
additionally  some of our customers are experiencing  or may experience in the future  severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness 
these financial problems may arise from the current financial crises  changes in commodity prices or otherwise 
we have and are working to implement  to the extent allowable under applicable contracts  tariffs and regulations  prepayments and other security requirements  such as letters of credit  to enhance our credit position relating to amounts owed from these customers 
we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our current or future financially distressed customers will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  future results of operations  or future cash flows  however  we believe we have provided adequate allowance for such customers 
short term liquidity we employ a centralized cash management program that essentially concentrates the cash assets of our operating partnerships and their subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing 
our centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of our operating partnerships and their subsidiaries are concentrated  consolidated  or otherwise made available for use by other entities within our consolidated group 
we place no restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities  payment of inter company balances or the ability to upstream dividends to parent companies other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities 
however  our cash and the cash of our subsidiaries is not concentrated into accounts of knight or any company not in our consolidated group of companies  and knight has no rights with respect to our cash except as permitted pursuant to our partnership agreement 
furthermore  certain of our operating subsidiaries are subject to ferc enacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs 
ferc regulated entities subject to these rules must  among other things  place their cash management agreements in writing  maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements  and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 
our outstanding short term debt as of december  was million  primarily consisting of a million principal amount of senior notes that matured and was paid on february  as of december   our outstanding short term debt was million 
our principal sources of short term liquidity are our billion five year senior unsecured revolving bank credit facility that matures august   and our cash from operations discussed following in operating activities 
borrowings under our five year credit facility can be used for general partnership purposes and as a backup for a commercial paper program 
the facility can be amended to allow for borrowings up to billion 
as of both december  and  we had no borrowings under our five year credit facility 
we provide for liquidity by maintaining excess borrowing capacity under our five year revolving credit facility 
after reduction for i our letters of credit  ii commercial paper and or borrowings under our revolving credit facility outstanding none at december   and iii lending commitments made by a lehman brothers related bank  the remaining available borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility was  million as of december  as a result of the revision to our short term credit rating and the current commercial paper market conditions  we are unable to access commercial paper borrowings and as of december   there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program 
however  we expect that our financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through borrowings made under our long term bank credit facility  and we do not anticipate that fluctuations in the availability of the commercial paper market will affect our liquidity because of the flexibility provided by our credit facility 
as of december   we had million of commercial paper outstanding 
currently  we believe our liquidity to be adequate  and we continue to monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our announced business strategy to grow our portfolio of businesses 
we expect that part of our short term financing and liquidity needs will continue to be met through our long term bank credit facility 
for more information on our credit facility  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
long term financing in addition to our principal sources of short term liquidity listed above  we could meet our cash requirements other than distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholders and general partner through issuing long term notes or additional common units  or by utilizing the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr with the proceeds from issuances of kmr shares 
on september   we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of on form s this registration statement  commonly referred to as a shelf registration statement  will allow us to sell up to billion of additional common units or debt securities 
the shelf registration statement is intended to provide us with flexibility to raise funds from the offering of our securities in one or more offerings  in amounts  and at prices to be set forth in subsequent filings made with the sec at the time of each separate offering 
this registration statement on form s was declared effective by the sec on december  pursuant to this shelf registration statement  on january   we entered into an equity distribution agreement with ubs securities llc 
according to the provisions of this agreement  we may offer and sell from time to time common units having an aggregate offering value of up to million through ubs  as sales agent 
sales of the units  if any  will be made by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the new york stock exchange at market prices  in block transactions or as otherwise agreed between us and ubs 
under the terms of this agreement  we also may sell common units to ubs as principal of its own account at a price agreed upon at the time of the sale 
any sale of common units to ubs as principal would be pursuant to the terms of a separate terms agreement between us and ubs 
we believe this equity distribution agreement provides us further flexibility to raise funds from the offering of our securities because it provides us the right  but not the obligation  to draw down on the facility in the future  at prices we deem appropriate 
we retain at all times complete control over the amount and the timing of each draw down  and we will designate the maximum number of common units to be sold through ubs  on a daily basis or otherwise as we and ubs agree 
ubs will then use its reasonable efforts to sell  as our sales agent and on our behalf  all of the designated common units 
we may instruct ubs not to sell common units if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price designated by us in any such instruction 
either we or ubs may suspend the offering of common units pursuant to the agreement by notifying the other party 
as of february   we have issued  of our common units pursuant to this agreement 
we received net proceeds of approximately million for the issuance of these common units 
our offerings would be subject to market conditions and our capital needs  and unless we specify otherwise in a prospectus supplement  we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of offered securities for general partnership purposes 
this may include  among other things  additions to working capital  repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness or other partnership obligations  financing of capital expenditures and acquisitions  investment in existing and future projects  and repurchases and redemptions of securities 
pending any specific application  we may initially invest funds in short term marketable securities or apply them to the reduction of other indebtedness 
we are subject  however  to changes in the equity and debt markets for our limited partner units and long term notes  and there can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for our limited partner units and or long term notes in the future 
if we were unable or unwilling to issue additional limited partner units  we would be required to either restrict potential future acquisitions or pursue other debt financing alternatives  some of which could involve higher costs or negatively affect our credit ratings 
furthermore  our ability to access the public and private debt markets is affected by our credit ratings 
see credit ratings and capital market liquidity above for a discussion of our credit ratings

all of our outstanding debt securities are unsecured obligations that rank equally with all of our other senior debt obligations  however  a modest amount of secured debt has been incurred by some of our operating partnerships and subsidiaries

capital structure we attempt to maintain a relatively conservative overall capital structure  financing our expansion capital expenditures and acquisitions with approximately equity and debt 
in the short term  we fund these expenditures from borrowings under our credit facility until the amount borrowed is of a sufficient size to cost effectively do either a debt or equity offering  or both 
with respect to our debt financed expenditures  we target a debt mixture of approximately fixed and variable 
we achieve our variable rate exposure primarily by issuing long term fixed rate debt and then swapping the fixed rate interest payments for variable rate payments 
our interest rate mix is currently weighted more heavily towards fixed interest rates due to a decision to terminate a portion of our interest rate swap agreements at attractive prices in december and january as discussed under interest rate risk below 
our equity offerings consist of the issuance of additional common units or the issuance of additional i units to kmr which kmr purchases with the proceeds from the sale of additional kmr shares to institutional investors 
capital expenditures our sustaining capital expenditures for the year were million including approximately million for our proportionate share of rockies express sustaining capital expenditures  and our forecasted expenditures for for sustaining capital expenditures are approximately million including million for our proportionate share of rockies express

in december  we terminated two existing fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements having a combined notional principal amount of million and we received combined proceeds of million  in march  we terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement having a notional principal amount of million and we received a termination payment of million  a million increase related to higher distributions received from equity investments chiefly due to million of initial distributions received in from our investment in westeast pipeline llc  the sole owner of rockies express pipeline llc 
currently  we own a equity interest in westeast pipeline llc  and when construction of the rockies express pipeline is completed  our ownership interest will be reduced to and the capital accounts of westeast pipeline llc will be trued up to reflect our economic interest in the project 
the overall increase in period to period distributions from equity investments includes a million decrease in distributions received from the red cedar gathering company 
in the first quarter of  red cedar distributed to us million following a refinancing of its long term debt obligations 
red cedar used the proceeds received from the march sale of unsecured senior notes to refund and retire the outstanding balance on its then existing senior notes  and to make a distribution to its two owners  a million decrease in cash inflows related to period to period changes in both non current assets and liabilities and other non cash expenses 
the decrease in cash was driven by  among other things  lower transportation and dock prepayments received from trans mountain pipeline system customers in  lower increases in environmental liability reserves in  and lower non cash general and administrative expenses in  due to higher expenses in related to the activities required to complete kmi s going private transaction 
with regard to the going private transaction expenses  for accounting purposes  knight is required to allocate to us a portion of these transaction related amounts and we are required to recognize the amounts as expense on our income statements  however  we were not responsible for paying these buyout expenses  and accordingly  we recognize the unpaid amount as both a contribution to partners capital and an increase to minority interest on our balance sheet  a million decrease in cash attributable to reparation and or refund payments made in to certain shippers on our pacific operations pipelines 
the settlement payments were made pursuant to both ferc orders and certain litigation settlement agreements primarily related to a ferc ruling in february that resolved certain challenges by complainants with regard to delivery tariffs and gathering enhancement fees at our pacific operations watson station  located in carson  california  and a million decrease in cash inflows relative to net changes in working capital items 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  million for the year ended december   compared to  million in the prior year 
the million overall increase in funds utilized in investing activities was primarily attributable to the following a million increase in cash used from higher capital expenditures largely due to increased investment undertaken to construct our kinder morgan louisiana pipeline  add infrastructure to our carbon dioxide producing and delivery operations  and expand our trans mountain crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline system 
since the end of  rising construction costs  additional regulatory requirements  and certain weather delays have continued to create a challenging business environment and accordingly  the amount of capital expenditures we made on our major projects during increased from the projection we made at the beginning of most of this increase has been on our major natural gas pipeline projects for example  market conditions for consumables  labor and construction equipment along with certain provisions in the final environmental impact statement have resulted in increased construction costs for the rockies express pipeline 
our current estimate of total construction costs for the entire rockies express pipeline project is now approximately billion our proportionate share is and this cost estimate is consistent with our january  fourth quarter earnings press release 
we continue to be focused on managing these cost increases in order to complete our expansion projects as close to on time and on budget as possible  and we attempt to identify ancillary opportunities to increase our returns where possible 
in addition to utilizing cash generated from its operations or proceeds from contributions received from its member owners  rockies express can fund its cash requirements for capital expenditures through borrowings under its own credit facility  issuing its own short term commercial paper when credit market conditions are favorable  or issuing long term notes 
our sustaining capital expenditures totaled million in and million in the above amounts include our proportionate share of rockies express sustaining capital expenditures approximately million in and none in but do not include the sustaining capital expenditures of our trans mountain pipeline system for periods prior to our acquisition date of april  generally  we fund our sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash or from cash flows from operations 
all of our capital expenditures  with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures  are discretionary  and our discretionary capital expenditures including expenditures for internal expansion projects totaled  million for  versus  million for  a million increase in cash used due to lower net proceeds received from the sales of investments  property  plant and equipment  and other net assets net of salvage and removal costs 
the decrease in cash sales proceeds was driven by the approximately million we received for the fourth quarter sale of our north system operations 
in  we received approximately million for the sale of our equity ownership interest in thunder creek gas services  llc both divestitures are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  a million increase in cash used from a loan we made in december to a single customer of our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group  a million increase in cash used from incremental contributions to investments in  largely driven by a million equity investment paid in february to westeast pipeline llc to partially fund its rockies express pipeline construction costs 
total contributions to westeast pipeline increased million in  when compared to  and in we also purchased a combined million in principal amount of tax exempt development revenue bonds and contributed million to fayetteville express pipeline llc  our owned equity investee that will construct and operate the fayetteville express natural gas pipeline 
our purchase of the revenue bonds was linked to corresponding loan agreements we entered into with borrowing authorities in the states of louisiana and mississippi 
per the loan agreements  we received million under the same payment and interest terms of the bonds  and we used the cash to partially fund our construction of our kinder morgan louisiana pipeline and our bulk terminal facility expansions within the state of mississippi 
the overall increase in period to period contributions to investments includes a million decrease in contributions paid to midcontinent express pipeline llc  the sole owner of the midcontinent express pipeline 
in and  we contributed million and million  respectively  for our proportionate share of midcontinent express pipeline construction costs 
a million decrease in cash used for acquisitions  including a decrease of million related to our acquisition of trans mountain from knight 
in  we paid million to knight to acquire the net assets of trans mountain  and in april  we received a cash contribution of million from knight as a result of certain true up provisions in our acquisition agreement 
for more information on our acquisition of trans mountain from knight  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the remaining million decrease in cash used was primarily related to higher expenditures for terminal assets in compared to a million decrease in cash used due to lower period to period payments for margin and restricted deposits in compared to  associated largely with our utilization of derivative contracts to hedge offset against the volatility of energy commodity price risks  and an million decrease in cash used related to a return of capital received from midcontinent express pipeline llc in the first quarter of in february  midcontinent entered into and then made borrowings under a new billion three year  unsecured revolving credit facility due february  midcontinent then made distributions in excess of cumulative earnings to its two member owners to reimburse them for prior contributions made to fund its pipeline construction costs 
a million increase in cash used due to changes in natural gas stored underground and natural gas linefill  property casualty indemnifications  and other items 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in  while in the prior year  our financing activities provided net cash of million 
the million overall decrease in cash inflows provided by financing activities was primarily due to a million decrease in cash from higher partnership distributions in  when compared to distributions paid in distributions to all partners  consisting of our common and class b unitholders  our general partner and our minority interests  totaled  million in  compared to  million last year 
the increase in partnership distributions reflects higher year over year distributable cash  which represents the amount of cash we generate that is available to pay our unitholders 
the increase in distributable cash was in turn driven by the increase in total segment earnings before depreciation and amortization expenses discussed above in results of operations 
more information on our cash distributions is provided below in partnership distributions  a million decrease in cash inflows from partnership equity issuances 
the decrease relates to the combined million we received  after commissions and underwriting expenses  from three separate offerings of additional common units in  versus the combined million we received last year from our may issuance of additional i units to kmr and our december public offering of additional common units 
both our and equity issuances are discussed more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  a million increase in cash from overall debt financing activities which include our issuances and payments of debt and our debt issuance costs 
the period to period increase in cash from overall financing activities was primarily due to i a million increase in cash inflows from net issuances and payments of senior notes  ii a million increase in cash from funds we originally invested in long term tax exempt development revenue bonds described above in investing activities  and iii an million decrease in cash inflows from lower overall net commercial paper borrowings 
the increase in cash from changes in senior notes outstanding reflects the combined  million we received from three separate public offerings of senior notes in discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  versus the  million increase in cash inflows from the issuances and payments of senior notes during see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on our issuances and payments of senior notes 
we used the proceeds from each of our debt offerings and from our first two offerings to reduce the borrowings under our commercial paper program 
we used the proceeds from our third and final debt offering in december to reduce the borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility  and a million increase in cash inflows from net changes in cash book overdrafts resulting from timing differences on checks issued but not yet endorsed 
a million increase in cash from repayment from loans to related party  contributions from minority interest  and other 
partnership distributions our partnership agreement requires that we distribute of available cash  as defined in our partnership agreement  to our partners within days following the end of each calendar quarter in accordance with their respective percentage interests 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts  including cash received by our operating partnerships and net reductions in reserves  less cash disbursements and net additions to reserves and amounts payable to the former general partner of sfpp  lp in respect of its remaining interest in sfpp 
our general partner is granted discretion by our partnership agreement  which discretion has been delegated to kmr  subject to the approval of our general partner in certain cases  to establish  maintain and adjust reserves for future operating expenses  debt service  sustaining capital expenditures  rate refunds and distributions for the next four quarters 
these reserves are not restricted by magnitude  but only by type of future cash requirements with which they can be associated 
when kmr determines our quarterly distributions  it considers current and expected reserve needs along with current and expected cash flows to identify the appropriate sustainable distribution level 
for  and  we distributed approximately  and  respectively  of the total of cash receipts less cash disbursements calculations assume that kmr unitholders received cash instead of additional i units 
the difference between these numbers and of distributable cash flow reflects net changes in reserves 
our general partner and owners of our common units and class b units receive distributions in cash  while kmr  the sole owner of our i units  receives distributions in additional i units 
we do not distribute cash to i unit owners but instead retain the cash for use in our business 
however  the cash equivalent of distributions of i units is treated as if it had actually been distributed for purposes of determining the distributions to our general partner 
each time we make a distribution  the number of i units owned by kmr and the percentage of our total units owned by kmr increase automatically under the provisions of our partnership agreement 
available cash is initially distributed to our limited partners and to our general partner 
these distribution percentages are modified to provide for incentive distributions to be paid to our general partner in the event that quarterly distributions to unitholders exceed certain specified targets 
available cash for each quarter is distributed first  to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  second  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  third  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  and fourth  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata  to owners of common units and class b units in cash and to owners of i units in the equivalent number of i units  and to our general partner 
incentive distributions are generally defined as all cash distributions paid to our general partner that are in excess of of the aggregate value of cash and i units being distributed 
our general partner s incentive distribution that we declared for and was million and million  respectively  while the incentive distribution paid to our general partner during and was million and million  respectively 
the difference between declared and paid distributions is because our distributions for the fourth quarter of each year are declared and paid in the first quarter of the following year 
on february   we paid a quarterly distribution of per unit for the fourth quarter of this distribution was greater than the distribution per unit we paid for the fourth quarter of we paid this distribution in cash to our common unitholders and to our class b unitholders 
kmr  our sole i unitholder  received additional i units based on the cash distribution per common unit 
we believe that future operating results will continue to support similar levels of quarterly cash and i unit distributions  however  no assurance can be given that future distributions will continue at such levels 
litigation and environmental as of december   we have recorded a total reserve for environmental claims  without discounting and without regard to anticipated insurance recoveries  in the amount of million 
in addition  we have recorded a receivable of million for expected cost recoveries that have been deemed probable 
as of december   our environmental reserve totaled million and our estimated receivable for environmental cost recoveries totaled million  respectively 
our environmental reserve is primarily established to address and clean up soil and ground water impacts from former releases to the environment at facilities we have acquired or accidental spills or releases at facilities that we own 
reserves for each project are generally established by reviewing existing documents  conducting interviews and performing site inspections to determine the overall size and impact to the environment 
reviews are made on a quarterly basis to determine the status of the cleanup and the costs associated with the effort 
in assessing environmental risks in conjunction with proposed acquisitions  we review records relating to environmental issues  conduct site inspections  interview employees  and  if appropriate  collect soil and groundwater samples 
additionally  as of december  and  we have recorded a total reserve for legal fees  transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities in the amount of million and million  respectively 
this reserve is primarily related to various claims from lawsuits arising from our west coast products pipelines operations  and the contingent amount is based on both the circumstances of probability and reasonability of dollar estimates 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these claims in order to determine the adequacy of our liability provision 
though no assurance can be given  we believe we have established adequate environmental and legal reserves such that the resolution of pending environmental matters and litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business  cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
however  changing circumstances could cause these matters to have a material adverse impact 
pursuant to our continuing commitment to operational excellence and our focus on safe  reliable operations  we have implemented  and intend to implement in the future  enhancements to certain of our operational practices in order to strengthen our environmental and asset integrity performance 
these enhancements have resulted and may result in higher operating costs and sustaining capital expenditures  however  we believe these enhancements will provide us the greater long term benefits of improved environmental and asset integrity performance 
please refer to notes and of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding pending litigation and environmental matters  respectively 
regulation the pipeline safety improvement act of requires pipeline companies to perform integrity tests on natural gas transmission pipelines that exist in high population density areas that are designated as high consequence areas 
pipeline companies are required to perform the integrity tests within ten years of december   the date of enactment  and must perform subsequent integrity tests on a seven year cycle 
at least of the highest risk segments must be tested within five years of the enactment date 
the risk ratings are based on numerous factors  including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline  as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating 
testing may consist of hydrostatic testing  internal electronic testing  or direct assessment of the piping 
a similar integrity management rule for refined petroleum products pipelines became effective may  all baseline assessments for products pipelines were required to be completed by march  and we met that deadline 
we have included all incremental expenditures estimated to occur during associated with the pipeline safety improvement act of and the integrity management of our products pipelines in our budget and capital expenditure plan

fair value measurements we utilize energy commodity derivative contracts for the purpose of mitigating our risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil  and utilize interest rate swap agreements to mitigate our risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
pursuant to current accounting provisions  we record our derivative contracts at their estimated fair values as of each reporting date 
for more information on our risk management activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
sfas no 
 fair value measurements establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring fair value 
the hierarchy of valuation techniques is based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs or reflect a company s own assumptions of market participant valuation unobservable inputs 
this framework defines three levels of inputs to the fair value measurement process  and requires that each fair value measurement be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the lowest level of fair value hierarchy based on these two types of inputs is designated as level  and is based on prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable 
as of december   the fair value of our derivative contracts classified as level under the established fair value hierarchy consisted primarily of west texas intermediate crude oil options costless collars and west texas sour crude oil hedges 
costless collars are designed to establish floor and ceiling prices on anticipated future oil production from the assets we own in the sacroc oil field unit 
while the use of these derivative contracts limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
in addition to these oil commodity derivatives  our level derivative contracts included natural gas basis swaps and natural gas options 
basis swaps are used in connection with another derivative contract to reduce hedge ineffectiveness by reducing a basis difference between a hedged exposure and a derivative contract 
natural gas options are used to offset the exposure related to certain physical contracts 
the following table summarizes the total fair value asset and liability measurements of our level energy commodity derivative contracts in accordance with sfas no 
significant unobservable inputs level assets liabilities december  december  change december  december  change wti options wts oil swaps natural gas basis swaps natural gas options other total the largest changes in the fair value of our level assets and liabilities between december  and december  were related to west texas intermediate options and west texas sour hedges 
we entered into the majority of our wti option contracts during  which accounts for the changes 
the changes in value from our wts swap contracts were largely due to favorable crude oil price changes since the end of there were no transfers into or out of level during the period 
the valuation techniques used for the above level input derivative contracts are as follows option contracts valued using internal model 
internal models incorporate the use of options pricing and estimates of the present value of cash flows based upon underlying contractual terms 
the models reflect management s estimates  taking into account observable market prices  estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices  the risk free market discount rate  volatility factors  estimated correlations of commodity prices and contractual volumes  wts oil swaps prices obtained from a broker using their proprietary model for similar assets and liabilities  quotes are non binding  and natural gas basis swaps values obtained through a pricing service  derived by combining raw inputs from the new york mercantile exchange referred to in this report as nymex with proprietary quantitative models and processes 
although the prices are originating from a liquid market nymex  we believe the incremental effort to further validate these prices would take undue effort and would not materially alter the assumptions 
as a result  we have classified the valuation of these derivatives as level for our energy commodity derivative contracts  the most observable inputs available are used to determine the fair value of each contract 
in the absence of a quoted price for an identical contract in an active market  we use broker quotes for identical or similar contracts  or internally prepared valuation models as primary inputs to determine fair value 
no adjustments were made to quotes or prices obtained from brokers and pricing services  and our valuation methods have not changed during the quarter ended december  when appropriate  valuations are adjusted for various factors including credit considerations 
such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence  including but not limited to our credit default swap quotes as of december  collateral agreements with our counterparties serve to reduce our credit exposure and are considered in the adjustment 
we adjust the fair value measurements of our energy commodity derivative contracts for credit risk in accordance with sfas no 
 and as of december   our consolidated accumulated other comprehensive loss balance included a gain of million related to discounting the value of our energy commodity derivative net assets for the effect of credit risk

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk generally  our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading 
our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or commodity prices 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 
energy commodity market risk we are exposed to commodity market risk and other external risks  such as weather related risk  in the ordinary course of business 
however  we take steps to hedge  or limit our exposure to  these risks in order to maintain a more stable and predictable earnings stream 
stated another way  we execute a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses 
our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil 
the derivative contracts we use include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange and over the counter markets  including  but not limited to  futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps and basis swaps 
fundamentally  our hedging strategy involves taking a simultaneous position in the futures market that is equal and opposite to our position  or anticipated position  in the cash market or physical product in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change 
for example  as sellers of crude oil and natural gas  we often enter into fixed price swaps and or futures contracts to guarantee or lock in the sale price of our oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery  thereby directly offsetting any change in prices  either positive or negative 
a hedge is successful when gains or losses in the cash market are neutralized by losses or gains in the futures transaction 
our policies require that we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors  and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties credit ratings 
while we enter into derivative transactions only with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard poor s rating services credit rating citigroup a j 
aron company goldman sachs a morgan stanley a as discussed above  our principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil 
using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide us increased certainty with regard to our operating cash flows and helps us undertake further capital improvement projects  attain budget results and meet distribution targets to our partners 
sfas no 
categorizes such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges  because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but whose value is uncertain 
cash flow hedges are defined as hedges made with the intention of decreasing the variability in cash flows related to future transactions  as opposed to the value of an asset  liability or firm commitment  and sfas no 
prescribes special hedge accounting treatment for such derivatives 
in accounting for cash flow hedges  gains and losses on the derivative contracts are reported in other comprehensive income  outside net income reported in our consolidated statements of income  but only to the extent that the gains and losses from the change in value of the derivative contracts can later offset the loss or gain from the change in value of the hedged future cash flows during the period in which the hedged cash flows affect net income 
that is  for cash flow hedges  all effective components of the derivative contracts gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss  pending occurrence of the expected transaction 
other comprehensive income loss consists of those financial items that are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets but not included in our net income 
thus  in highly effective cash flow hedges  where there is no ineffectiveness  other comprehensive income changes by exactly as much as the derivative contracts and there is no impact on earnings until the expected transaction occurs 
all remaining gains and losses on the derivative contracts the ineffective portion are included in current net income 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts is the difference between the gain or loss from the change in value of the derivative contract and the effective portion of that gain or loss 
in addition  when the hedged forecasted transaction does take place and affects earnings  the effective part of the hedge is also recognized in the income statement  and the earlier recognized effective amounts are removed from accumulated other comprehensive loss 
if the forecasted transaction results in an asset or liability  amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss should be reclassified into earnings when the asset or liability affects earnings through cost of sales  depreciation  interest expense  etc 
the accumulated components of other comprehensive income are reported separately as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
for us  the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets primarily include i the effective portion of the gains and losses on cash flow hedging items  and ii foreign currency translation adjustments 
the gains and losses on hedging items primarily relate to the derivative contracts associated with our hedging of anticipated future cash flows from the sales and purchases of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil 
the translation adjustments are a cumulative total  resulting from translating all of our foreign denominated assets and liabilities at current exchange rates  while equity is translated by using historical or weighted average exchange rates 
the total accumulated other comprehensive loss included within the partners capital section of our accompanying balance sheets as of december  and december   included amounts associated with energy commodity price risk management activities of million and  million  respectively 
the total accumulated other comprehensive loss as of december  also included a cumulative translation debit unrealized loss balance of million 
the total accumulated other comprehensive loss as of december  included a cumulative translation credit unrealized gain balance of million in future periods  as the hedged cash flows from our actual purchases and sales of energy commodities affect our net income  the related gains and losses included in our accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of our hedging are transferred to the income statement as well  effectively offsetting the changes in cash flows stemming from the hedged risk 
we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil markets utilizing a value at risk model 
value at risk is a statistical measure indicating the minimum expected loss in a portfolio over a given holding period  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
we utilize a closed form model to evaluate risk on a daily basis 
the value at risk computations utilize a confidence level of for the resultant price movement and a holding period of one day is chosen for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk number presented 
derivative contracts evaluated by the model include commodity futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps  basis swaps and over the counter options 
for each of the years ended december  and  our value at risk reached a high of million and million  respectively  and a low of million and million  respectively 
value at risk as of december  was million  and averaged million for value at risk as of december  was million  and averaged million for our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative contracts assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 
in addition  as discussed above  we enter into these derivative contracts solely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and  therefore  the change in the market value of our portfolio of derivative contracts  with the exception of a minor amount of hedging inefficiency  is offset by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 
for more information on our risk management activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
interest rate risk in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure  it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
as of december  and  the carrying values of our fixed rate debt were approximately  million and  million  respectively 
these amounts compare to  as of december  and  fair values of  million and  million  respectively 
fair values were determined using quoted market prices  where applicable  or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
a hypothetical change approximately basis points in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for and  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair values of these instruments 
the carrying value and fair value of our variable rate debt  including associated accrued interest and excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements discussed below  was million as of december  and million as of december  a hypothetical change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings  when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december  and  including adjustments for notional swap amounts  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in our and annual pre tax earnings 
we adjusted the fair value measurement of our long term debt as of december  in accordance with sfas no 
 and the estimated fair value of our debt as of december  includes a decrease of million related to discounting the fair value measurement for the effect of credit risk 
as of december  and  we were a party to interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of billion and billion  respectively 
an interest rate swap agreement is a contractual agreement entered into between two counterparties under which each agrees to make periodic interest payments to the other for an agreed period of time based upon a predetermined amount of principal  which is called the notional principal amount 
normally at each payment or settlement date  the party who owes more pays the net amount  so at any given settlement date only one party actually makes a payment 
the principal amount is notional because there is no need to exchange actual amounts of principal 
we entered into our interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of transforming a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long term fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
since the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest  we enter into swap agreements to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest 
such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest  and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 
as of both december  and  all of our interest rate swap agreements represented fixed for variable rate swaps  where we agreed to pay our counterparties a variable rate of interest on a notional principal amount  comprised of principal amounts from various series of our long term fixed rate senior notes 
in exchange  our counterparties agreed to pay us a fixed rate of interest  thereby allowing us to transform our fixed rate liabilities into variable rate obligations without the incurrence of additional loan origination or conversion costs 
we monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements 
in general  we attempt to maintain an overall target mix of approximately fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
as of december   our cash and investment portfolio included approximately million in fixed income debt securities 
because our investment in debt securities was made and will be maintained in the future to directly offset the interest rate risk on a like amount of long term debt  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio  and because we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information related to our debt instruments  for more information on our interest rate swap agreements  see note
