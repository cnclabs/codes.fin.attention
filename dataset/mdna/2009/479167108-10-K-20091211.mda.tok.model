critical accounting policies and estimates the company s management discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of its assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related footnote disclosures 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates for product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed these policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of ownership have passed to the buyer 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated by the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer accounts receivable balances 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
though the company considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates and any specific customer collection issues the company identifies could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on required reserve balances 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost determined using the first in first out method or market 
management s judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated or because the amount on hand is more than will be used to meet future needs 
inventory reserves are estimated by the individual operating companies using standard quantitative measures based on criteria established by the company 
the company also considers current forecast plans  as well as market and industry conditions in establishing reserve levels 
though the company considers these balances to be adequate  changes in economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on required reserve balances 
deferred taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
goodwill and other intangible assets impairment goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
during  the company elected to change the measurement date of its annual assessment of goodwill impairment to one month earlier from the end of the fiscal year to the last day of fiscal august 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test under asc  intangibles goodwill and other  in the fourth quarter of in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  the company estimates the fair value of the businesses to which the goodwill relates 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value  no impairment exists 
when fair value is less than the carrying value of the net assets and related goodwill  an impairment test is performed to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the company has three reporting units that have recorded goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles that were tested for impairment 
the canadian watercraft reporting unit had a fair value that was below its net book value and was determined to be fully impaired resulting in an impairment charge of million 
the global diving reporting unit and the marine electronics reporting unit had fair values that were above their respective net book values and carried goodwill of approximately million and million respectively 
the estimate of fair value for the reporting units are calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires a number of key estimates and assumptions 
we estimated the future cash flows of the reporting units based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs 
we applied a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for purposes of the valuation 
this discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital  which includes certain assumptions such as market capital structure  market betas  risk fee rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing 
changes in these key estimates and assumptions  or in other assumptions used in this process  could materially affect our impairment analysis in a given year 
at the company s annual impairment testing date  the measurement of the global diving reporting unit indicated that global diving is at risk for failing its impairment test in future periods in the event significant assumptions such as an increase to the discount rate or reduction in estimated earnings were to occur in the future period 
the company recognized a million and million impairment charge in fiscal and  respectively 
the company s remaining goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles could be further impaired in future periods 
a number of factors  many of which the company has no ability to control  could affect its financial condition  operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions that the company used in its calculation 
these factors include prolonged global economic crisis  a significant decrease in demand for the company s products  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator and successful efforts by the company s competitors to gain market share 
the company s cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units may change significantly 
such changes could result in impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
warranties the company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
warranty reserves are estimated by the individual operating companies using standard quantitative measures based on criteria established by the company 
estimates of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience  expectation of future conditions and known product issues 
to the extent the company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required 
the company engages in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers  to help minimize warranty obligations
