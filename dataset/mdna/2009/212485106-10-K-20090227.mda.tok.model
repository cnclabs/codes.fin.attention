overview customer management our customer management segment  which accounted for of our consolidated revenues in  partners with clients to deliver solutions that enhance the value of their customer relationships  turning the customer experience into a strategic differentiator 
as an end to end single source provider of self service  agent assisted and proactive care  we combine consulting  innovative technology and agent assisted services to optimize the customer experience and strengthen customer relationships 
whether contact center operations are on premises  fully outsourced or blended  we customize our solutions to meet our clients needs 
on september   we acquired percent of the outstanding common shares of intervoice  a developer of automated voice response systems  for cash consideration of intervoice is a market leader in the delivery of personalized  multi channel automated information solutions that connect people with information  empowering them to control the way they interact with a business 
we expect the integration of intervoice s speech automation and mobile applications with the company s agent assisted services will enable us to build upon our leadership position in relationship management solutions 
our solutions result in improved operational efficiencies  new revenue streams and  most importantly  enhanced differentiation in the large and growing automated services market 
the operating results of intervoice have been included within the customer management segment as of the date of the acquisition 
as more fully described below under the heading  customer management  customer management revenues increased from the prior year to  customer management operating income and operating margin were and  respectively  compared with and in the positive impact from both the intervoice acquisition and operating efficiency improvements were more than offset by the negative foreign currency impact of approximately  as well as investments in our consulting and relationship technology resources and infrastructure costs

information management continues to face competition as well as consolidation within the communications industry 
in january  at t  our largest client  informed us that it intended to migrate its subscribers from the legacy wireless billing system that we currently support through a managed services agreement onto at t s other wireless billing system over the next two years 
while the migration is subject to change  we anticipate that this will result in a loss of revenue of an amount equal to approximately and in and  respectively  compared to our information management revenues 
the impact of this migration on our revenues was approximately compared to our information management revenues 
in september  sprint pcs  a large data processing outsourcing client  completed its acquisition of nextel communications 
in  sprint nextel informed us that it intended to consolidate its billing systems onto a competitor s system 
the migration began in and was substantially completed by june  revenues from sprint nextel were down  or approximately  in compared to the corresponding period last year 
we expect revenue from sprint nextel to be down by approximately in  compared to this revenue decline is incorporated in our guidance discussed in the business outlook section  and we do not expect these migrations to have a material impact on our liquidity and capital resources 
in the third quarter of  we announced that we were evaluating a potential separation of the information management business from convergys to create two independent  publicly traded companies  each focused on its own set of business opportunities 
we retained a third party financial advisor to assist us with this process 
in january  given reduced technology spending by the communications industry and turmoil in capital markets  we determined that the company is not currently in a position to separate the information management business from convergys at this time 
however  we will continue to evaluate this option and provide updates regarding the plan as the year progresses in human resource management our hr management segment provides a full range of human resource outsourcing solutions including benefits administration  compensation  human resource administration  learning  payroll administration  performance management  recruiting and sourcing services to large companies and governmental entities 
we take advantage of our economies of scale in order to standardize human resource processes across departments  business lines  language differences and national borders 
hr management accounted for of our consolidated revenues in as more fully described below under the heading human resource management  hr management revenues increased to from the prior year 
hr management operating loss for was compared to a loss of in the prior year 
the operating loss includes in asset impairment and implementation charges  of which relates to deferred charges and goodwill impairment and relates to expensing of implementation costs 
these charges reflect challenges with complex implementations which have caused an increase in overall implementation and delivery costs and an assessment of capitalized implementation expenses and goodwill 
we have begun a series of actions that will reduce our implementation risk and improve the future earnings in hr management 
actions taken include not signing any new hr management outsourcing business with significant implementation risk  as well as streamlining existing operations  continuing to use additional automation  standardization and leveraging of off shore assets 
through the combination of the client go lives  lower implementation expense and aggressive cost cutting  our expectation is that we will see significant improvement from this business in convergys corporation annual report

the of charges  as more fully described under the heading human resource management  reflect challenges with complex implementations  which have caused an increase in overall implementation and delivery costs and an assessment of capitalized implementation expenses and goodwill 
the customer management operating income decline was due to the negative foreign exchange impact as well as higher costs related to investments in consulting and relationship technology resources and infrastructure partially offset by contribution from the intervoice acquisition

as discussed in further detail in the section titled market risk  we hedge this exposure by entering into foreign currency forward contracts and options to limit potential foreign currency exposure

pass through revenues for and were and  respectively 
costs and expenses in  we recorded of asset impairment and implementation charges at hr management  of which related to impairment of deferred charges and goodwill and related to expensing of implementation costs 
the charges reflect challenges with complex implementations which have caused an increase in overall implementation and delivery costs and an assessment of capitalized implementation expenses and goodwill 
as discussed more fully in the deferred charges section of note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  typically implementation costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the life of the contract 
deferred amounts are periodically evaluated for impairment or when circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amounts 
in the event these costs are not deemed recoverable  we follow the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to determine if impairment exists 
based upon the contract profitability analysis completed in the third quarter of  two global hr management contracts were projected to be unprofitable over their contract terms  due to an increase in their overall implementation and delivery costs 
as a result  the capitalized costs of related to these contracts were impaired and  therefore  were written down as impairment charges and are recorded within the asset impairments caption in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
after the write off  one of the contracts is expected to be profitable over its remaining contract term and the other contract is expected to continue to generate losses 
the losses from this executory contract will be recorded as incurred  over the contract term through in our consolidated statements of operations and are not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements 
further  during the third quarter of  the costs of implementing another large hr management outsourcing client contract exceeded the amount recoverable at september  under the contract 
when implementation costs are deemed not recoverable  such excess costs are expensed even if the contract is profitable over its term  in accordance with our accounting policy 
this resulted in expensing of of implementation costs in the third quarter of  even though the contract is expected to be profitable over its convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents term 
this charge is recorded within the cost of providing services and products sold caption in the consolidated statements of operations 
the charges discussed above  recorded during the third quarter of triggered an impairment review of the goodwill related to the hr management segment 
as discussed more fully in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  the second step requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
we determined that the fair value of the hr management segment was less than its carrying value as of september  and  therefore  the second step of the test was required 
this second step review of the hr management segment was completed during the fourth quarter of and resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of recorded within the asset impairments caption in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in determining the amount of the hr management related goodwill impairment  we engaged a third party appraisal firm to assist in valuing the significant intangible assets of the reporting unit 
key assumptions used by the company in determining the fair value of the hr management segment include revenue increases from existing contracts as services go live and an estimate of future cash implementation costs and revenue

we provide customer management services to sprint nextel under a contract between sprint nextel and ibm  as a subcontractor to ibm 
we serve directv  our third largest client in  under customer management contracts 
volumes under certain of our long term contracts are subject to variation based on  among other things  the spending by clients on outsourced customer support and subscriber levels 
business outlook we and our clients are facing a challenging economic environment within which forecasting is difficult 
going into  some of our existing clients are projecting lower volumes and for planning purposes we have assumed that these adverse conditions will generally continue convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amounts in millions except per share amounts throughout actual economic conditions could positively or negatively impact performance for the year 
given these planning assumptions  expectations for performance are as follows we expect overall revenue to grow slightly in growth is expected to come from a modest increase in customer management including the intervoice acquisition and hr management  partially offset by a decline in information management 
we also expect a slight overall improvement in operating income 
this will include a modest increase in customer management operating income  improvement in hr management operating loss  and some decline in information management 
the overall operating income improvement will be more than offset by expected higher interest expense  as our business plan includes assumptions regarding higher debt levels primarily from the intervoice acquisition and cost of potentially refinancing the bond that is due in december an expected tax rate in the range of about for the full year  with higher rates in the beginning of the year 
given the uncertain environment  we expect earnings per share in the range of and 
this reflects the difficulty of predicting the impact of the current environment on client business 
free cash flow is expected to be approximately in  driven by continued contributions to net income from information management and customer management  reductions in cash usage in hr management  minimal cash tax outflows  and depreciation and amortization expense greater than capital expenditures 
the expected free cash flow of  combined with the cash on the balance sheet at december   would provide us with sufficient liquidity to retire the debt maturing in december  and also provide us with an ability to invest in our business in and beyond 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources liquidity and cash flows we believe that convergys has adequate liquidity from cash and expected future cash flows to fund ongoing operations  invest in the business and make required debt payments 
for  we expect free cash flow to be approximately  significantly higher than the free cash flow of major factors causing the expected increase in free cash flow include a reduction in implementation costs for two global hr management contracts as we have completed the key portions of the implementations and achieved key go live milestones 
an increase in implementation revenue from one of the global hr management clients based on existing contractual payment terms and achieving certain milestones 
an improvement in the hr management operating results as a result of additional revenue realized from ongoing services being performed post go live dates and cost reductions 
the combination of the above factors is expected to result in improvement in the cash flow 
our expected free cash flow will be negatively impacted to the extent there are project delays  contractual settlements or cost overruns related to the remaining implementation phases of the two large hr management contract implementations 
receipts of implementation revenue are based on scheduled contractual amounts and achieving certain milestones 
if achieving the milestones date is delayed  our cash flow could be negatively impacted by a material amount 
in addition to the above factors  we expect that cash flow will be positively impacted in by actions being taken to continue to accelerate collection of accounts receivables  to improve payment terms with vendors and to further reduce capital spending and can be negatively impacted by collateral requirements and client bankruptcies 
convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents we expect that the combination of free cash flow and the solid liquidity position as of december   including cash of  will provide us with the ability to fund ongoing operations  invest in the business and retire the unsecured senior notes due in december without obtaining additional financing 
however  if external financing markets improve during the year  then we may examine opportunities to increase our financial flexibility through the capital markets 
cash flow from operating activities generally provides us with a significant source of funding for our investing and financing activities 
net cash flows from operations net cash flows used in investing net cash flows provided by used in financing computation of free cash flows net cash flows from operations capital expenditures  net of proceeds from disposal of assets free cash flows cash flows from operating activities totaled in  compared to in and in compared to the prior year  the decline in cash flow from operations was driven largely by the increase in net deferred charges due to additional hr management contract implementation costs in the current year 
total implementation related costs  less implementation revenue paid by the clients  and the related amortization of these cost and revenue is described below as net deferred charges 
during  net deferred charges increased by excluding the impact of the of impairment and implementation charges that were incurred in the third quarter in the hr management segment 
we believe that the implementation costs for both of our two large hr management outsourcing contracts have peaked in in  the increase in net deferred charges related to client implementations incurred primarily at hr management was approximately the increase in net deferred charges during compared to was nearly offset by a reduction in accounts receivable of approximately and a decline in other working capital requirements of approximately the decrease in cash flow from operating activities during  compared to  was driven by changes in working capital 
the working capital increases were mostly due to lower bonus accruals in  a decrease in advance billing amounts in and the timing of both accounts payable and restructuring payments 
also in  the increase in net deferred charges related to client implementations incurred primarily at hr management was approximately we used for investing activities in compared to in and in during  we paid net of cash acquired for the acquisition of intervoice in the customer management segment and three small acquisitions in the information management segment 
the investing activity in was favorably impacted by a return of capital from the cellular partnerships 
at this point  we are not aware of any material capital calls from the general partner of cincinnati smsa limited partnership 
the decrease in amounts for investing activities during compared to was due to sale of our short term investments during financing activities provided in compared to using cash of in and in during the third quarter of  we borrowed the entire amount available under our five year competitive advance and revolving credit facility  primarily to fund the acquisition of intervoice 
also in  we repurchased million of the company s shares of common stock for at the current time  we do not anticipate executing additional share repurchases in the cash flow used during and was largely due to debt repayments and repurchase of the company s common stock

as of december   our credit ratings and outlook are as follows long term debt outlook moody s ba under review  possible downgrade standard and poor s bb negative the current as well as any further downgrades could have a negative impact on both our access to capital markets and financing costs 
the company s free cash flow  defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures net of proceeds related to disposals  was  and for  and  respectively 
the company uses free cash flow to assess the financial performance of the company 
the company believes that free cash flow is useful to investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations  such as investment in the company s existing businesses 
further  free cash flow facilitates management s ability to strengthen the company s balance sheet  to repurchase the company s common shares and to repay the company s debt obligations 
limitations associated with the use of free cash flow include that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it does not incorporate certain cash payments including payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions 
management compensates for these limitations by utilizing both the non gaap measure  free cash flow  and the gaap measure  cash from operating activities  in its evaluation of performance 
there are no material purposes for which we use this non gaap measure beyond the purposes described above 
capital resources  off balance sheet arrangements and contractual commitments we believe that our financial structure and condition are solid 
at december   total capitalization was  consisting of of short term and long term debt and  of equity 
at december   total capitalization was  consisting of of short term and long term debt and  of equity 
the total debt to capital ratio at december   was  which compares to at december  the increase in this ratio is due to higher level of borrowings in compared to  primarily as a result of the acquisition of intervoice 
during the third quarter of  we borrowed the entire amount available under our five year competitive advance and revolving credit facility 
this borrowing was mainly to fund our acquisition of intervoice as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the commitment fee on this facility at december  was 
the maturity date of the revolving credit facility agreement is october  the participating agents in the credit facility include jpmorgan chase bank  citicorp usa  pnc bank and deutsche bank ag 
the company s credit facility includes certain restrictive covenants including maintenance of interest coverage and debt to ebitda ratios 
our interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of consolidated earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda to consolidated interest expense  cannot be less than to for four consecutive quarters 
our debt to ebitda ratio cannot be greater than to at any time 
we were in compliance with all covenants throughout in december  we issued in unsecured senior notes due december  the notes were offered and sold pursuant to our universal shelf registration statement  previously declared effective in june at december  and  the senior notes had an outstanding balance of and  respectively 
in may  we filed a shelf registration statement for the issuance of a senior debt in a form not yet determined 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we lease certain facilities and equipment used convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents in our operations under operating leases 
this includes our office complex in orlando  florida  which is leased from wachovia development corporation lessor  a wholly owned subsidiary of wachovia corporation  under an agreement that expires in june upon termination or expiration of the lease  we must either purchase the property from the lessor for or arrange to have the office complex sold to a third party 
if the office complex is sold to a third party for an amount less than the  the amount paid by the lessor for the purchase of the complex from an unrelated third party  we have agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to if the office complex is sold to a third party for an amount in excess of  convergys is entitled to collect the excess 
at the inception of the lease  we recognized a liability of approximately for the related residual value guarantee 
the value of the guarantee was determined by computing the estimated present value of probability weighted cash flows that might be expended under the guarantee 
we have recorded a liability for the fair value of the obligation with a corresponding asset recorded as prepaid rent  which is being amortized to rental expense over the lease term 
the liability will remain on the balance sheet until the end of the lease term 
under the terms of the lease  we also provide certain indemnities to the lessor  including environmental indemnities 
due to the nature of such potential obligations  it is not possible to estimate the maximum amount of such exposure or the fair value 
however  we do not expect such amounts  if any  to be material 
we have concluded that we are not required to consolidate the lessor pursuant to financial accounting standards board financial interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
historically  we believed that our ability to borrow was greater than our established credit facilities in place 
due to current financial and credit market conditions  we believe that there is only limited ability to borrow additional funds 
at december   we had cash of and committed and undrawn credit facilities totaling we repurchased million shares of our common stock for during pursuant to our authorizations 
at the current time  we do not anticipate executing additional share repurchases in the timing and terms of any future transactions depend on a number of considerations including market conditions and our liquidity

at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of related to performance and payment guarantees  of which is set to expire by the end of  is set to expire within to years and is set to expire after years 
we do not believe that any obligation that may arise will be material 
market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our risk convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amounts in millions except per share amounts management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on our operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates  we expose ourselves to counterparty credit risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements and by diversifying the number of financial institutions with which we enter into such agreements 
interest rate risk at december   we had in outstanding variable rate borrowings 
the carrying amount of our borrowings reflects fair value due to their short term and variable interest rate features 
our variable interest rate debt had an effective interest rate of during the year ended december  based upon our exposure to variable rate borrowings  a one percentage point change in the weighted average interest rate would change our annual interest expense by approximately we sometimes use interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate exposure 
these instruments are hedges of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
there were no outstanding interest rate swaps covering interest rate exposure at december  during the first quarter of  we entered into treasury lock derivative instruments with a total notional amount of in anticipation of a probable debt issuance later in as we did not expect issuance of the debt in the near future given the market conditions during the third quarter of  the gain on termination of the treasury lock was recognized within the other income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  foreign currency exchange rate risk our company serves many of our us based clients using contact center capacity in canada  india and the philippines 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars cad  philippine pesos php or indian rupees inr  which represents a foreign exchange exposure 
we have hedged a portion of our exposure related to the anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in these foreign currencies by entering into forward contracts with several financial institutions to acquire a total of cad at a fixed price of through december  php  at a fixed price of through september and inr  at a fixed price of through june additionally  we had entered into option contracts to purchase approximately php  for a fixed price of through june the fair value of these derivative instruments as of december  is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the potential loss in fair value at december  for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
other foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
we periodically enter into forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges 
the purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect the company against foreign currency exposure pertaining to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies different from the functional currencies of the company or the respective subsidiaries 
as of december   the fair value of these derivatives was a payable of critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents states 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments in these areas based on historical experience and other relevant factors 
our estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
we have identified below the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical in compiling our statements of financial condition and operating results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
contingencies the company is from time to time subject to claims and administrative proceedings that are filed in the ordinary course of business 
we believe that the results of any such claims or administrative proceedings  either individually or in the aggregate  will not have a materially adverse effect on the results of operations or our financial condition 
however  the outcome of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty 
an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or our financial condition in the future 
deferred charges in connection with our outsourcing arrangements  we often perform a significant amount of set up activities or implementations  which include the installation and customization of our proprietary software in our centers 
under these arrangements  clients do not take possession of the software nor have the right to take possession of the software without incurring a significant penalty 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  the implementations are not treated as separate elements for revenue recognition purposes 
any proceeds collected for the implementations are deferred and recognized over the service period 
additionally  with respect to certain multiple element arrangements  we defer all revenue related to the contracts until the final element is delivered 
we capitalize all direct and incremental implementation and multiple element costs  to the extent recovery is probable  and amortize them ratably over the life of the arrangements as costs of providing service 
deferred amounts are periodically evaluated for impairment or when circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amounts 
in the event these costs are not deemed recoverable  we follow the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to determine if an impairment exists 
we evaluate the probability of recovery by considering profits to be earned during the term of the contract  the creditworthiness of the client and  if applicable  contract termination penalties payable by the client in the event that the client terminates the contract early 
our estimate of profitability is dependent in large part on our estimate of costs 
although we make every reasonable effort to accurately estimate costs  revisions may be made based on actual costs incurred that could result in the recording of an impairment loss 
additionally  if the financial condition of a client were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments  we may be unable to recover the costs  which would result in an impairment loss 
finally  our entitlement to termination fees may be subject to challenge if a client were to allege that we were in breach of contract 
during the third quarter of  we recorded of impairment and implementation charges  of which was due to impairment of deferred charges and was due to expensing of implementation costs that exceeded the termination for convenience fees in the contract at convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amounts in millions except per share amounts september  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details related to these charges 
based on our evaluation of all the related contracts  we believe that the of deferred charges at december  is recoverable 
goodwill at december   we had goodwill with a net carrying value of  as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually as of october and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  the second step requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a combination of the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  fair value is based on actual stock price or transaction prices of comparable companies 
the market approach requires significant judgment regarding the selection of comparable companies 
under the income approach  value is dependent on the present value of net cash flows to be derived from the ownership 
the income approach requires significant judgment including estimates about future cash flows and discount rates 
during the third quarter of  we recorded an asset impairment charge of within the hr management segment 
as more fully described in note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements  recording this asset impairment charge triggered a review of goodwill related to the hr management segment resulting in an impairment loss of the goodwill impairment loss is recorded within the asset impairments caption in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment tests for the remaining four of our five reporting units information management international  information management north america  customer management and relationship technology management 
based on the results of the first step  we had no goodwill impairment related to our remaining four reporting units 
in addition  due to the decline in our stock price during the fourth quarter of  we updated our impairment tests as of december  and had no goodwill impairment related to any of our reporting units 
we believe we make every reasonable effort to ensure that we accurately estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
however  future changes in the assumptions used to make these estimates could result in an impairment loss 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and the company s tax methods of accounting 
the company also reviews its tax activities and records a liability for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb no 
the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount  which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense 
significant judgment is required in determining our liability for uncertain tax positions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be significantly different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
we believe that we make a reasonable effort to ensure accuracy in our judgment and estimates 
restructuring charges during the last five years  we have recorded significant restructuring charges related to reductions in headcount and facility closures 
as of december   we had a restructuring accrual of  of which relates to facility closure costs  which will be paid over several years until the leases expire 
the accrual is equal to the future costs associated with those abandoned facilities  net of the proceeds from any probable future sublease agreements 
we have used estimates  based on consultation with real estate advisors  to arrive at the proceeds from any future sublease agreements 
we will continue to evaluate our estimates in recording the facilities abandonment charge 
as a result  there may be additional charges or reversals in the future 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a portion of our revenues is derived from transactions that require a significant level of judgment 
this includes percentage of completion we recognize some software license and related professional and consulting revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion 
this method of accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
because the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contracts  recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contracts progress to completion 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized revenues 
when estimates indicate a loss under a contract  a provision for such loss is recorded as a component of cost of providing services and products sold 
as work progresses under a loss contract  revenues continue to be recognized  and a portion of the contract loss incurred in each period is charged to the contract loss reserve 
convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amounts in millions except per share amounts license arrangements approximately of our consolidated revenues were derived from license and support and maintenance arrangements 
the accounting for these arrangements can be complex and requires a significant amount of judgment 
some of the factors that we must assess include the separate elements of the arrangement  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various undelivered elements of the arrangement  whether the software fees are fixed or determinable  whether the fees are considered collectible and whether services included in the arrangement represent significant production  customization or modification of the software 
multiple element outsourcing arrangements hr management  which accounted for of our consolidated revenues in  delivers multiple services under our client arrangements eg  benefits administration  recruiting  payroll and learning 
in connection with these arrangements  we must assess these multiple element arrangements to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  establishes the following criteria  all of which must be met  in order for a deliverable to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered items have value to the client on a stand alone basis 
there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
if these criteria are met  each of the contractual services included in the contract is treated as a separate unit of accounting and revenue is recognized as we deliver each of the contractual services 
if these criteria are not met  all of the services included are accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
revenue is then recognized either using a proportional performance method such as recognizing revenue based on transactional services delivered or on a straight line basis once hr management begins to deliver the final service 
the assessments of these areas require us to make a significant amount of judgments 
the judgments made in these areas could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized 
we believe that we make a reasonable effort to ensure accuracy in our judgment and estimates 
other we have made certain other estimates that  while not involving the same degree of judgment  are important to understanding our financial statements 
these estimates are in the areas of measuring our obligations related to our defined benefit plans  self insurance accruals and assessing recoverability of intangible assets

we serve clients in industries that have experienced a significant level of consolidation 
we cannot assure that additional consolidations will not occur in which our clients acquire additional businesses or are acquired themselves 
such consolidations may result in the termination of an existing client contract  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amounts in millions except per share amounts a large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients in the communications industry  and the loss of one or more of our clients  or weakness in the communications industry  could cause a reduction in our revenues and earnings 
we rely on several clients for a large percentage of our revenues 
our three largest clients  at t  sprint nextel and directv  collectively represented of our revenues 
our relationship with at t is represented by separate contracts work orders with information management and customer management 
our relationship with sprint nextel is represented by separate information management and customer management contracts 
since february  we have provided customer management services to sprint nextel under a contract between sprint nextel and ibm  whereby we serve as a subcontractor to ibm 
we do not believe that it is likely that our entire relationship with at t or sprint nextel would terminate at one time  and  therefore  we are not substantially dependent on any particular contract work order with these clients 
however  the loss of all of the contracts work orders with a particular client at the same time or the loss of one or more of the larger contracts work orders with a client would adversely affect our total revenues if the revenues from such client were not replaced with revenues from that client or other clients 
our revenues and earnings would also be negatively impacted by general weakness or slowdown in the communications industry 
a large portion of our accounts receivable are payable by a limited number of clients and the inability of any of these clients to pay its accounts receivable could cause a reduction in our revenues and earnings 
several significant clients account for a large percentage of our accounts receivable 
as of december   our three largest clients  at t  sprint nextel and directv  collectively accounted for of our accounts receivable 
during the past four years  each of these clients has generally paid its accounts receivable on a timely basis  and write downs that we have incurred in connection with such accounts receivable were consistent with write downs that we incurred with other clients 
we anticipate that several clients will continue to account for a large percentage of our accounts receivable 
although we currently do not expect payment issues with any of these clients  if any of them were unable or unwilling  for any reason  to pay our accounts receivable  our income would decrease 
we have several important clients that are in industries  including automotive  that have been severely impacted by the current global economic slowdown 
we also carry significant receivable balances with other clients whose declaration of bankruptcy could decrease our income 
in addition  our income could be materially impacted by a number of small clients declaring bankruptcy in a short period of time 
if our clients are not successful  the amount of business that they outsource and the prices that they are willing to pay for such services may diminish and could result in a reduction of our revenues and earnings 
our revenues depend on the success of our clients 
if our clients or their specific programs are not successful  the amount of business that they outsource may be diminished 
thus  although we have signed contracts  many of which contain minimum revenue commitments  to provide services to our clients  there can be no assurance that the level of revenues generated by such contracts will meet expectations 
this could result in stranded capacity and additional costs 
in addition  we may face pricing pressure from clients  which could negatively affect our operating results 
revenues in most of our larger hr management contracts are partially based on our clients headcount 
our revenues could be negatively impacted by headcount reductions and restructuring actions taken by our clients

unauthorized access  system denials of service  or failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations may subject us to contractual liability and damages  loss of business  damages from individual claimants  fines  penalties  criminal prosecution and unfavorable publicity  any of which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  third party vendors that we engage to perform services for us may have an unintended release of personally identifiable information 
the global scope  size and complexity of implementations in our hr management business could cause delays and cost overruns in those projects  which could adversely affect revenues  cash flows and profits 
our large hr outsourcing contracts with global clients are complex as they involve providing multiple services such as payroll  recruiting  benefits administration  learning  compensation and human resources administration across many countries 
implementations of the contracts can take a number of years to complete 
due to the complexity of the implementations and changes in customer requirements eg  an acquisition by a customer during the implementation  implementation cost overruns and delays are possible 
cost overruns can result in additional expense during the implementation period and over the life of the contract  which would likely affect the profitability of the contract and potentially result in charges 
given the size of some of these contracts  the impact from these cost overruns or schedule delays can have a significant impact on our revenues  cash flows and profits 
delays in completing the implementations can cause us to recognize revenue and profit from the contracts later than we anticipated when the initial contract was signed 
our ability to deliver our services is at risk if the technology and network equipment that we rely upon is not maintained or upgraded in a timely manner

if the reliability of technology or network operations fall below required service levels  or a systemic fault affects the organization broadly  business from our existing and potential clients may be jeopardized and cause our revenue to decrease 
emergency interruption of data centers and customer management and hr management contact centers could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that we experience a temporary or permanent interruption at one or more of our data or contact centers  through casualty  operating malfunction or other causes  we may be unable to provide the data processing  customer management and hr management services we are contractually obligated to deliver 
this could result in us being required to pay contractual damages to some clients or to allow some clients to terminate or renegotiate their contracts 
notwithstanding disaster recovery and business continuity plans and precautions instituted to protect our clients and us from events that could interrupt delivery of services including property and business interruption insurance that we maintain  there is no guarantee that such interruptions would not result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide support services to our clients or that such precautions would adequately compensate us for any losses we may incur as a result of such interruptions

design defects or software errors may delay software introductions or reduce the satisfaction level of clients and may have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our software is highly complex and may  from time to time  contain design defects or software errors that may be difficult to detect and or correct 
since both our clients and we use our software to perform critical business functions  design defects  software errors or other potential problems within or outside of our control may arise from the use of our software 
it may also result in financial or other damages to our clients  for which we may be held responsible 
although our license agreements with our clients may often contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims and liabilities arising from client problems  these provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims in all cases and in all jurisdictions 
claims and liabilities arising from client problems could result in monetary damages to us and could cause damage to our reputation  adversely affecting our business and results of operations 
if the global trend toward outsourcing does not continue  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
revenue growth depends  in large part  on the trend toward outsourcing  particularly as it relates to our customer management and hr management outsourcing operations 
outsourcing involves companies contracting with a third party  such as convergys  to provide customer management and hr management services rather than performing such services in house 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue  as organizations may elect to perform such services in house 
a significant change in this trend could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are susceptible to business and political risks from domestic and international operations that could result in reduced revenues or earnings 
we operate a global business and have facilities located throughout north and south america  europe  the middle east and the asian pacific region 
as part of our strategy  we plan to capture more of the international bss oss  customer management and hr management markets 
additionally  north american companies require offshore customer management outsourcing capacity 
as a result  we expect to continue expansion through start up operations and acquisitions in foreign countries 
expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional countries will require management attention and financial resources 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally including exposure to currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws  changes in legal or regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent that we are adversely affected by these risks  our business could be adversely affected and our revenues and or earnings could be reduced 
in addition  there has been political discussion and debate related to worldwide competitive sourcing  labor related legislation and information flow restrictions  particularly from the united states to offshore locations 
federal and state legislation has been proposed that relates to this issue 
future legislation  if enacted  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in particular  proposed legislation  known as the employee free choice act  if enacted in its current form or a similar variation thereof  could make it easier for union organizing drives to be successful and could give third party arbitrators the ability to impose terms of collective bargaining upon both the company and a labor union if the parties are unable to agree to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement within specified timelines

table of contents our earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency 
customer management serves an increasing number of its us based clients using contact center capacity in canada  india and the philippines 
about one half of our approximately  contact center employees are located outside the us although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred by customer management to render services under these contracts is denominated in canadian dollars  indian rupees or philippine pesos  which represents a foreign exchange exposure to the company 
we enter into forward exchange contracts and options to limit potential foreign currency exposure 
as the us dollar weakens the operating expenses of these contact centers  translated into us dollars  increase 
the increase in operating expenses will be partially offset by gains realized through the settlement of the hedged instruments 
as the derivative instruments that limit our potential foreign currency exposures are entered into over a period of several years  the overall impact to earnings will be determined by both the timing of the derivative instruments and the movement of the us dollar 
in addition to the impact on our operating expenses that support dollar denominated customer management contracts  changes in foreign currency impact the results of our international business units that are located outside of north america 
in  of our revenues were generated outside of north america 
if we do not effectively manage our capacity  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our ability to profit from the global trend toward outsourcing depends largely on how effectively we manage our customer management and hr management contact center capacity 
in order to create the additional capacity necessary to accommodate new or expanded outsourcing projects  we may need to open new contact centers 
the opening or expansion of a contact center may result  at least in the short term  in idle capacity until we fully implement the new or expanded program 
expanded use of home agents is helping to mitigate this risk 
we periodically assess the expected long term capacity utilization of our contact centers 
as a result  we may  if deemed necessary  consolidate  close or partially close under performing contact centers to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal utilization of our contact center capacity 
as part of our effort to consolidate our facilities  we seek to sublease a portion of our surplus space  if any  and recover certain costs associated with it 
to the extent that we fail to sublease such surplus space  our expenses will increase 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel in certain areas of our business  our ability to execute our business plans in those areas could be impaired and revenues could decrease 
we employ approximately  employees worldwide 
at times  we have experienced difficulties in hiring personnel with the desired levels of training or experience 
additionally  in regard to the labor intensive business of customer management  quality service depends on our ability to retain employees and control personnel turnover 
any increase in the employee turnover rate could increase recruiting and training costs and could decrease operating effectiveness and productivity 
we may not be able to continue to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to adequately staff new client projects 
because a significant portion of our operating costs relates to labor costs  an increase in wages  costs of employee benefits or employment taxes could have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
war and terrorist attacks or other civil disturbances could lead to economic weakness and could disrupt our operations resulting in a decrease of our revenues and earnings 
in the recent past  war and terrorist attacks have caused uncertainty in the global financial markets and economy 
additional attacks and wars could contribute to economic instability in the united states and disrupt our operations in the us and abroad 
such disruptions could cause service interruptions or reduce the quality level of the services that we provide  resulting in a reduction of our convergys corporation annual report

these activities may also cause our clients to delay or defer decisions regarding their use of our services and  thus  delay receipt of additional revenues 
in addition  war and terrorist attacks in other regions could disrupt our operations and or create economic uncertainty with our clients  which could cause a reduction in revenues and earnings 
general economic and market conditions may adversely affect the company s financial condition  cash flow and results of operations 
our results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our clients  which in turn are affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve 
economic slowdowns in some markets  particularly in the united states  may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients  which may result in reductions in the growth of new business as well as reductions in existing business 
if our clients enter bankruptcy or liquidate their operations  our revenues could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that weakening economic conditions throughout the world will not adversely impact our results of operations  cash flow and or financial position 
further deterioration in equity markets will reduce the funded status of our pension plan  which will increase future required contributions 
reduced demand for our services could increase price competition 
we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to have sufficient cash to meet operating cash flow requirements and to repay maturing debt and other obligations 
if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements  it may adversely affect our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of operations and access to capital markets 
as of december   total cash and cash equivalents was  and our available borrowing capacity under committed lines was we believe our liquidity including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and required debt repayments as they occur  however  our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets 
as further described in the capital resources section of the management discussion and analysis  our revolving credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants in the agreements 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies 
the company faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters  including  but not limited to  commercial  securities law and patent infringement claims 
unfavorable outcomes in pending litigation matters  or in future litigation  could negatively affect the company 
aggressive plaintiffs counsel often file litigation on a wide variety of allegations  and even when the allegations are groundless  the company may need to expend considerable funds and other resources to respond to such litigation 
in the ordinary course of business  the company may make certain commitments  including representations  warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations  including those related to acquired or divested businesses and issue guarantees of third party obligations 
if the company were required to make payments as a result of any of these matters  they could exceed the amounts accrued  thereby adversely affecting the company s results of operations  cash flows  financial condition  or business 
the company s failure to successfully integrate or acquire businesses could cause its business to suffer 
our expansion and growth may be dependent in part on our ability to make acquisitions 
the risks we face related to acquisitions include that we could overpay for acquired businesses  face integration challenges  have difficulty finding appropriate acquisition candidates  and any convergys corporation annual report

if acquisitions are not successfully integrated  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected as well as adversely impact our reputation 
the company s debt ratings are no longer considered investment grade 
in moody s and standard and poor s both downgraded the company s debt ratings to below investment grade 
this could impact our ability to raise capital in the future as well as increase borrowing costs 
in addition  prospective clients and vendors may be less willing to do business with a provider with higher perceived credit risk or demand more onerous terms 
we may incur additional non cash goodwill impairment charges in the future 
as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually as of october and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicates the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
during the company recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of there can be no assurances that we will not incur additional charges in the future  particularly in the event of a prolonged economic slowdown 
we sometimes rely on business partners to market  develop and deliver our solutions 
their failure to perform could negatively impact our financial results and harm our reputation in the marketplace 
we use third party business partners to assist in project implementations  to provide components of our solutions and to expand our ability to sell into new markets 
failure of third parties to perform in a timely manner could result in contractual or regulatory penalties  project delays or cost overruns as well as a failure to close new business
