critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in the preparation of these financial statements  the company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions

in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  the company considers the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter  case law and other case specific issues

however  the time and cost required to litigate these matters as well as the outcomes of the proceedings may vary from what the company has projected 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the failure of customers to make required payments 
on an ongoing basis  the collectibility of accounts receivable is assessed based upon historical collection trends  current economic factors and the assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts 
the company evaluates the collectibility of specific accounts and determines when to grant credit to its customers using a combination of factors  including the age of the outstanding balances  evaluation of customers current and past financial condition  recent payment history  current economic environment  and discussions with appropriate company personnel and with the customers directly 
accounts are written off when it is determined the receivable will not be collected 
if circumstances change  the company s estimates of the collectibility of amounts could be changed by a material amount 
the company is required to estimate its provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating its actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
the company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it believes that recovery is more likely than not  does not establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
pension plan benefits are expensed as applicable employees earn benefits 
the recognition of expenses is significantly impacted by estimates made by management such as discount rates used to value certain liabilities and expected return on assets 
the company uses third party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with pension plan benefits 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  pension plan expenses could be materially impacted

at december   all remaining assets were invested in a money market account 
the company did not make any contributions to the plan during  and it believes that no further contributions to the plan will be required to finalize the plan termination based upon the plan s year end funded status 
the company estimates that future benefit payments will be less than  in prior to the final payout for the plan termination which will likely occur in mid after all regulatory approvals are received 
the company currently projects benefit payments for the final payout to be approximately million

the company assesses the impairment of its long lived identifiable assets  excluding goodwill which is tested for impairment pursuant to sfas as explained below  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this review is based upon projections of anticipated future cash flows 
while the company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows or future changes in the company s business plan could materially affect its evaluations 
no such changes are anticipated at this time 
the company assesses goodwill for impairment pursuant to sfas which requires that goodwill be assessed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis by applying a fair value test 
during  and  none of the company s critical accounting policy estimates required significant adjustments 
the company did not note any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of material long lived assets were not recoverable
