this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of bancorp 
executive overview bancorp was created as a result of the merger of fnb and lsb  effective july  accordingly  the fiscal year ended december  marked the first full year of operation of the combined company 
bancorp s results of operations for the full year do not include the operating results for fnb prior to july  in accordance with purchase accounting rules  prior year financial information does not include any data for fnb 
bancorp operated two separate nc chartered commercial banks until november  when fnb southeast merged with and into lsb bank  and the bank was renamed newbridge bank 
the year ended december  was a turbulent year for the us economy and the financial services industry in particular 
deteriorating home values  among other factors  provided a catalyst for declining valuations across nearly all asset classes  including loans and securities 
the property value declines  which began in late  continued to build throughout while bancorp did not have material exposure to many of the issues that plagued the industry eg  sub prime loans  structured investment vehicles  collateralized debt obligations  bancorp s exposure to the residential housing sector  primarily within its commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios  pressured its loan portfolio  resulting in increased credit costs and other real estate expenses 
nevertheless  the company experienced loan and deposit growth during the first half of and announced net income in the first and second quarters 
during the second half of  bancorp experienced a slowdown in balance sheet growth  higher levels of past due and nonperforming loans  higher provision and allowance levels  and recorded net losses in the third and fourth quarters 
assets at december  totaled billion  an increase of million since december  this is primarily due to growth in the company s loan portfolio  partially offset by the writeoff of goodwill 
compared to december   loans increased million to billion  investment securities decreased million to million  deposits increased million to billion  total borrowings decreased million to million  and shareholders equity decreased million to million 
book value per common share was at december   compared to at year end  while tangible book value per common share was at december  compared to at december  the negative operating results over the second half of were influenced by the considerable stress upon the national  state and local economies that resulted in lower economic output and higher unemployment in bancorp s markets 
this had the overall effect of reducing income and cash flow for retail and commercial customers of bancorp  and caused higher levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets 
bancorp was also negatively affected by the stress on the financial markets caused by the actual or perceived failure of large  individually significant financial institutions 
this resulted in expensive funding costs relative to the federal funds rate and the prime lending rate  and significantly reduced the bank s interest rate spread one of the most significant factors in determining the profitability of a bank 
as a result of the deteriorating national economic situation  and the substantial declines in us and world stock markets  the price of the company s common stock declined substantially during the second half of the year 
in accordance with accounting regulations  the company  with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist  re evaluated its goodwill at december  the company concluded that the goodwill was impaired  and  as of december   the company wrote off all of the million of goodwill in its financial statements  which had been recorded primarily as the result of the merger 

table of contents based primarily on the economic factors described above  for the full year the company recorded a net loss available to common shareholders of million per diluted share or  excluding the goodwill impairment  a net loss of million per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million per diluted share for strategic initiatives strengthening capital position 
in response to the current economic operating environment and uncertain future trends  bancorp took action to strengthen its capital position in during  bancorp reduced its common dividend due to the outlook for a continued negative credit environment  preserving over million of capital in relative to the prior level 
on december   bancorp received million as part of the us treasury cpp and issued senior preferred stock and ten year warrants under the terms of the program  which had the effect of increasing bancorp s three regulatory capital ratios by approximately to basis points 
both bancorp and the bank s capital ratios exceed the well capitalized guidelines 
as of december   bancorp s total risk based capital ratio was  tier capital ratio was  and tier leverage ratio was 
as of december   the bank s total risk based capital ratio was  tier capital ratio was  and tier leverage ratio was improve loan portfolio performance 
a sustained recession in bancorp s markets and an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets  net charge offs  provision for loan losses  and valuation adjustments on loans during in order to mitigate these effects  the company has developed an action plan  designed to improve loan quality and loan portfolio performance 
included in the plan are actions to conduct regularly scheduled meetings to develop effective plans to more efficiently manage individual past due loans and loan relationships  and credit forums with credit administration and loan production staff to more actively monitor past due loans and other pertinent credit issues 
in an effort to increase the yield on the loan portfolio  the plan includes an action to establish new pricing parameters for commercial loans  based on risk grade and by loan type 
the plan seeks to rebalance the loan portfolio by reducing the percentage of commercial real estate loans and increasing the percentage of commercial and industrial type loans 
the plan also requires loan officers to attend targeted training classes to strengthen their skills regarding calling strategies and identifying target customers  and to refine their credit skills to support the planned migration to a greater emphasis on commercial and industrial loans 
increase non interest income 
bancorp is actively seeking to increase the operational profitability of existing non interest income lines of business 
material improvements in the profitability level of investment and trust services are sought as bancorp intends to focus more attention on managing its sales and marketing efforts  conduct a thorough review of its fee schedules  and better coordinate its cross selling efforts and referral arrangements 
it is anticipated that intensified sales and marketing initiatives will increase profitability in lines of business such as cash management and merchant services 
grow core deposits 
the intensified financial crisis during the second half of has made it increasingly difficult to secure wholesale funding at reasonable cost 
during the coming year  the bank intends to emphasize core deposit growth 
because competition for core deposits has increased  it is anticipated that pricing may not always be favorable to the bank 
nevertheless  the market currently places a premium on liquidity  and thus maintaining increased liquidity will continue to be a priority 
the bank plans to develop several marketing plans to emphasize its superior customer service  commitment to local communities  and both its ability and willingness to serve clients in a consultative partnership 
new bundled deposit packages have been developed to add value to the retail and commercial customer base 
the bank has developed a marketing plan targeting commercial and non profit organizations that value the high touch style of banking and recognize the value added services provided by the bank 
in addition  the bank has aligned its organizational structure  job duties and goals to emphasize core deposit generation 
production goals assigned to calling officers are heavily weighted toward core deposit generation 

table of contents the bank has also implemented regular sales meetings to report and monitor overall deposit goals with actual results 
control and reduce expenses 
over the course of  bancorp has conducted an intense and detailed review of all noninterest expenses on a line by line basis throughout the entire organization 
as a result  bancorp executed on significant expense reduction initiatives that it believes will benefit operating results in future periods 
expense reductions are expected to be realized in the areas of personnel  occupancy  professional services  information technology  as well as other categories 
bancorp significantly revised its expense approval procedures to align decision making authority with accountability for meeting budgets 
bancorp also migrated to a new budget and variance reporting system during the second half of  in order to increase the levels of accountability throughout the organization 
position the franchise for future growth 
to promote continued and sustainable business growth  bancorp has thoroughly examined its opportunities to create a uniquely positioned community bank that is able to bring value to small to mid size businesses and targeted retail segments 
the branch network has been analyzed to identify opportunities to reposition existing offices and opportunities to open new offices in selected markets 
performance metrics have been developed to drive improved efficiencies through our branch network 
demographic information has been used to identify markets that match the targeted customer profiles for the bank 
bancorp intends to increase its market share in dynamic growth markets by pursuing its comprehensive business growth plan to expand the branch network in targeted markets concentrated in the piedmont triad area of north carolina 
during  bancorp began implementation of this plan by closing four branches  acquiring a full service branch and opening a new loan production office 
financial condition at december  and bancorp s consolidated assets of billion at year end reflect an increase of over year end  following an increase of during the previous year

the table  investment securities  presents the composition of the securities portfolio for the last three years  as well as information about cost  fair value and weighted average yield 
total deposits increased million to billion at december   a increase from a total of billion one year earlier 
this change was the result of increased time deposits  partially offset by decreases in demand deposits and money market deposits 
the competition for deposits within the bank s market areas increased significantly during as larger national and regional banks increased their rates in an effort to attract deposits and maintain adequate liquidity 
the bank  which historically has relied on appropriate pricing and high quality customer service to retain and increase its retail deposit base  was forced to compete with higher rates offered by the larger national and regional banks in order to satisfy its deposit requirements 
in order to attract additional deposits when necessary  the bank uses several different sources such as membership in electronic deposit gathering networks that allow it to post interest rates and attract deposits from across the us bulletin board deposits  brokered certificates of deposit secured through broker dealer partnerships and deposits obtained through the promontory interfinancial network  also known as cdars 
the bank s reliance on bulletin board deposits has continued to decrease during  while the use of brokered deposits has increased from million at year end to million at year end the bank has used the cdars program in as the preferred method for gathering non core deposits and will likely continue that trend in the bank also has a credit facility available with the fhlb of atlanta 
the bank utilized a portion of the approximately million credit line with the fhlb of atlanta to fund earning assets 
fhlb borrowings totaled million at year end management believes this is a cost effective and prudent alternative to deposit balances  since particular amounts  terms and structures may be selected to meet current needs

loan approval and review 
when the aggregate outstanding loans to a single borrower or related entities exceed an individual officer s lending authority  the loan request must be considered and approved by an officer with a higher lending limit 
all consumer purpose loan decisions are made by the bank s central underwriting support group

the bank has a loan review program  headed by the loan review manager who reports directly to the credit management committee of the bank s board of directors 
included in this program is an annual loan review coverage plan which is approved by the credit management committee and which stipulates a certain volume of loan reviews to be completed by the loan review manager and employees under their guidance  and an additional number of loan reviews to be completed by independent loan review consulting firms 
in addition  all loan officers are charged with the responsibility of reviewing their portfolios and making adjustments to the risk ratings as needed 
a watch loan committee  which includes the cco  the special assets manager and the special asset officers  reviews all loans graded special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss on a monthly basis  and this meeting is observed by the loan review manager and summarized for the credit management committee  also on a monthly basis 
the bank s credit review system supplements its loan rating system  pursuant to which the bank may place a loan on its criticized asset list or may classify a loan in one of various other classification categories 
a specified minimum percentage of loans in each adverse asset classification category  based on the historical loss experience of the bank in each such category  are used to determine the adequacy of the bank s allowance for credit losses monthly 
these loans are also individually reviewed by the watch loan committee of the bank to determine whether a greater allowance allocation is justified due to the facts and circumstances of a particular adversely classified loan 
the loan portfolio is analyzed on an ongoing basis to evaluate current risk levels  and risk grades are adjusted accordingly 
the bank s allowance for credit losses is also analyzed monthly by management 
this analysis includes a methodology that separates the total loan portfolio into homogeneous loan classifications for purposes of evaluating risk

it is the responsibility of each lending officer to assign an appropriate risk grade to every loan originated 
credit administration  through the loan review process  validates the accuracy of the initial risk grade assessment 
in addition  as a given loan s credit quality improves or deteriorates  it is the lending officer s responsibility to recommend a change in the borrower s risk grade 
currently  the grading process utilized by the bank is segmented by product type see discussion below 
this methodology does not provide a direct correlation with groupings utilized in the other tables presenting loan information 
the bank s loan portfolio consists of loans made for a variety of commercial and consumer purposes 
because commercial loans are made based to a great extent on the bank s assessment of a borrower s income  cash flow  character and ability to repay  such loans are generally viewed as involving a higher degree of credit risk than is the case with residential mortgage loans or consumer loans 
to manage this risk  the bank s commercial loan portfolio is managed under a defined process which includes underwriting standards and risk assessment  procedures for loan approvals  loan grading  ongoing identification and management of credit deterioration and portfolio reviews to assess loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with the bank s credit policies and procedures

the entire amount of the allowance is available to absorb losses occurring in any category 
the allocation is not necessarily indicative of future losses 
in general  consumer loans including mortgage and home equity have a lower risk profile than commercial loans 
commercial loans including commercial real estate  commercial non real estate and construction loans 
table of contents are generally larger in size and more complex than consumer loans 
commercial real estate loans are deemed less risky than commercial non real estate and construction loans  because the collateral value of real estate generally maintains its value better than non real estate or construction collateral 
the bank has little or no exposure to subprime lending 
consumer loans  which are smaller in size and more geographically diverse across the bank s entire primary market area  provide risk diversity across the portfolio 
because mortgage loans are secured by first liens on the consumer s residential real estate  they are the bank s lowest risk profile loan type 
home equity loans are deemed less risky than unsecured consumer loans as home equity loans and lines are secured by first or second deeds of trust on the borrower s residential real estate 
a centralized decision making process is in place to control the risk of the consumer  home equity and mortgage loan portfolio 
the consumer real estate appraisal process is also centralized relative to appraisal engagement  appraisal review  and appraiser quality assessment 
these processes are detailed in the underwriting guidelines  which cover each retail loan product type from underwriting  servicing  compliance issues and closing procedures 
management follows a loan review program designed to evaluate the credit risk in its loan portfolio 
through this loan review process  the bank maintains an internally classified watch list that helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets  management considers  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the borrower s ability to repay  the borrower s payment history and the current delinquent status 
as a result of this process  certain loans are categorized as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss and reserves are allocated based on management s judgment and historical experience 
the function of determining the allowance for credit losses is fundamentally driven by the risk grade system 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of the appropriate level of reserve to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
in determining the allowance for credit losses and any resulting provision to be charged against earnings  particular emphasis is placed on the results of the loan review process 
consideration is also given to a review of individual loans  historical loan loss experience  the value and adequacy of collateral  and economic conditions in the bank s market areas 
for loans determined to be impaired  the allowance is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize changes to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
loans are charged off when in the opinion of management  they are deemed to be uncollectible 
recognized losses are charged against the allowance  and subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
management believes the allowance for credit losses of million at december  is adequate to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio  however  assessing the adequacy of the allowance is a process that requires continuous evaluation and considerable judgment 
management s judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current events which it believes to be reasonable  but which may or may not be valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that credit losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely affecting future operating results of the bank 
the following table presents an analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan losses

all commercial loans within the portfolio are risk graded among nine risk grades based on management s evaluation of the overall credit quality of the loan  including the payment history  the financial position of the borrower  the underlying collateral value  an internal credit risk assessment and examination results 
there is an increased reserve percentage for each successively higher risk grade 
as a result  the allowance is adjusted upon any migration of a loan to a higher risk grade within the commercial loan portfolio 
the reserve percentages utilized have been determined by management to be appropriate based on historical loan loss levels and the risk for each corresponding risk grade 
following the merger  the bank elected to adjust the reserve percentage for certain risk grades  based on its analysis of the history of the combined loan portfolio and the associated chargeoffs  as well as current economic conditions 
based on these revisions  approximately million was added to the allowance for credit losses at the end of the bank had of its total commercial loans in risk grades that are deemed acceptable or better at year end  compared to at year end mortgage  home equity  and credit lines 
reserves are calculated on mortgage  home equity  and credit lines based on historical loss experience and current economic conditions 
the average rolling eight quarter net loss percentage is calculated for each of these loan categories 
the reserve requirement also includes a reserve percentage for current economic conditions 
the sum of these two components is applied to the dollar balance of loans in each of these categories to determine the required reserve 
retail loans 
the retail loans are pooled together to determine the reserve requirement 
the average rolling eight quarter net loss percentage is calculated for this loan category 
the reserve requirement also includes a reserve percentage for current economic conditions 
the sum of these two components is applied to the dollar balance of retail loans to determine the required reserve for current loans and loans past due less than days 
a separate reserve is calculated for loans past due days or more 
a reserve amount equal to of all retail loans past due days or more is added to the above mentioned requirement to determine the total reserve requirement for retail loans 

table of contents specific impairment under sfas no 
management evaluates significant loans graded substandard  doubtful and loss on an individual basis for impairment 
the specific allowance is calculated based upon a review of these loans and the estimated losses at the balance sheet date

impaired loans at december  consisted of million of retail loans past due days or more  or classified as non accrual  million of commercial and real estate loans graded substandard  and million graded doubtful 
impaired loans at december  consisted of million of retail loans past due days or more  or classified as non accrual  million of commercial and real estate loans graded substandard  and million graded doubtful 
the increase in the amount of impaired loans held by the bank resulted primarily from a reevaluation of the credit quality of the portfolio  considering current economic conditions and continuing efforts to resolve the quality issues identified through the combined efforts of internal and external loan reviews 
watch list review 
specific allowances may be determined based on a review of specific watch list loans 
specific losses are estimated at each measurement date 
the bank has established a watch list committee to review all loans placed on the watch list 
the watch list primarily consists of loans classified as special mention  substandard and doubtful 
an action plan is established for each watch list loan 
by reviewing these watch list loans  the bank is able to update original probable loss amounts in light of developing conditions 
this serves to reduce the differences between estimated and actual observed losses 
during  the bank continued to focus on reviewing its loan portfolio and reclassifying its loans  as required 
watch list loans increased to million at year end  from million at year end the reserve requirement for watch list loans totaled million and million for and  respectively 
provision for credit losses

effects of inflation inflation affects financial institutions in ways that are different from most commercial and industrial companies  which have significant investments in fixed assets and inventories 
the effect of interest rate movements in response to changes in the actual and perceived rates of inflation can materially impact bank operations  which rely on net interest margins as a major source of earnings 
noninterest expense  such as salaries and wages  occupancy and equipment cost are also negatively affected by inflation 
application of critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practice within the banking industry  and are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of the bank s allowance for credit losses  one of the most complex and judgmental accounting policies of the company 
the allowance for credit losses  which is utilized to absorb actual losses in the loan portfolio  is maintained at a level consistent with management s best estimate of probable credit losses incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the bank s allowance for credit losses is also analyzed monthly by management 
this analysis includes a methodology that separates the total loan portfolio into homogeneous loan classifications for purposes of evaluating risk 
the required allowance is calculated by applying a risk adjusted reserve requirement to the dollar volume of loans within a homogenous group 
major loan portfolio subgroups include risk graded commercial loans  mortgage loans  home equity loans  retail loans and retail credit lines 
management also analyzes the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis to evaluate current risk levels  and risk grades are adjusted accordingly 
while management uses the best information available to make evaluations  future adjustments may be necessary  if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used 
see additional discussion under asset quality above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk is considered to be the bank s interest rate risk 
interest rate risk on our balance sheet arises from the maturity mismatch of interest earning assets versus interest bearing liabilities  as well as the potential for maturities to shorten or lengthen our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  market risk is the possible chance of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and rates 
these changes may result in a reduction of current and future period net interest income  which is the favorable spread earned from the excess of interest income on interest earning assets  over interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk management is a part of the bank s overall asset liability management process 
the primary oversight of asset liability management rests with the bank s asset and liability committee  which is comprised of the bank s ceo  chief financial officer cfo  cco  investment officer  chief risk officer and other senior executives 
the committee meets on a monthly basis to review the asset liability management activities of the bank and monitor compliance with established policies 
activities of the asset and liability committee are reported to the audit committee of the company s board of directors 

table of contents a primary objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to ensure the stability and quality of the bank s primary earnings component  net interest income 
this process involves monitoring the bank s balance sheet in order to determine the potential impact that changes in the interest rate environment may have on net interest income 
rate sensitive assets and liabilities have interest rates that are subject to change within a specific time period  due to either maturity or to contractual agreements which allow the instruments to reprice prior to maturity 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities react to changes in interest rates within a similar time period  thereby minimizing the risk to net interest income

the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between repricing assets and repricing liabilities for a particular time period 
the table  interest sensitivity analysis  indicates a ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within one year at december   to be x 
this ratio indicates that a larger balance of liabilities  compared to assets  could potentially reprice during the upcoming month period 
included in rate sensitive liabilities are certain deposit accounts now  mmi  and savings that are subject to immediate withdrawal and repricing  yet have no stated maturity 
these balances are presented in the category that management believes best identifies their actual repricing patterns 
the overall risk to net interest income is also influenced by the bank s level of variable rate loans 
these are loans with a contractual interest rate tied to an index  such as the prime rate 
a portion of these loans may reprice on multiple occasions during a one year period due to changes in the underlying rate index 
approximately of the total loan portfolio has a variable rate and reprices in accordance with the underlying rate index subject to terms of individual note agreements 

table of contents in addition to the traditional gap analysis  the bank also utilizes a computer based interest rate risk simulation model 
this comprehensive model includes rate sensitivity gap analysis  net interest income analysis  and present value of equity analysis  under various rate shock scenarios 
the bank uses this model to monitor interest rate risk on a quarterly basis and to detect trends that may affect the overall net interest income of the bank 
this simulation incorporates the dynamics of balance sheet and interest rate changes and calculates the related effect on net interest income 
as a result  management believes that this analysis more accurately projects the risk to net interest income over the upcoming month period 
the bank s asset liability policy provides guidance for levels of interest rate risk and potential remediations  if necessary  to mitigate excessive levels of risk 
the modeling results indicate the bank is subject to an acceptable level of interest rate risk 
the company considers the bank s interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk  which could potentially have the greatest impact on operating earnings 
based on actual experience  the bank has demonstrated to be asset sensitive  which means that falling interest rates could result in a reduced amount of net interest income 
the bank is not subject to other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity or equity price risk
