some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the special note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors sections of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a biodefense company engaged in the development and commercialization of medical countermeasures against biological and chemical weapons 
we currently have five product candidates in various stages of development sparvax a second generation rpa anthrax vaccine  valortim a fully human monoclonal antibody for the prevention and treatment of anthrax infection  protexia which mimics a natural bioscavenger for the treatment or prevention of nerve agent poisoning by organophosphate compounds  including nerve gases and pesticides  rypvax a recombinant dual antigen vaccine for pneumonic and bubonic plague  and a third generation rpa anthrax vaccine 
recent events in march  barda issued a broad agency announcement baa for the advanced research and development of chemical  biological  radiological  and nuclear medical countermeasures  which included an advanced development solicitation for proposals covering anthrax anti toxins 
the baa states that research and technical objectives proposed by offerors may include non clinical research and development  process development  formulation  manufacturing development  and 
table of contents clinical evaluation efforts 
in response we submitted an initial proposal providing for further development of valortim and are awaiting a response 
on march   we closed on the public sale of an aggregate of  newly issued shares of our common stock at per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of  the warrants will be exercisable beginning on september  and will expire on september   five years from the date they become exercisable 
we intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes  including the satisfaction of existing obligations 
critical accounting policies estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant estimates and assumptions and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
fasb r regarding share based payments the fasb issued fas r  which requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement based on their grant date fair values 
costs of all share based payments are recognized over the requisite service period that an employee must provide to earn the award ie usually the vesting period and charged to the operating expense associated with that employee 
revenue recognition we generate our revenue from two different types of contractual arrangements cost plus fee contracts and cost reimbursable grants 
revenues on cost plus fee contracts are recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus an estimate of the applicable fees earned 
we consider fixed fees under cost plus fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
we analyze each cost reimbursable grant to ensure reporting of revenues gross versus net is appropriate based on the guidance in the aicpa federal government contractors guide or the financial accounting standards board s fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue  gross versus net  whichever is most appropriate 
our contracts may include the provisions of more than one of our services 
collaborative research and development agreements can provide for one or more of up front license fees  research payments  and milestone payments 
in these situations  we recognize revenue in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accordingly  for applicable arrangements  revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values  with proper consideration given to the guidance provided by other authoritative literature 

table of contents revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones  if deemed substantive  are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved and the milestone payments are due and collectible 
if not deemed substantive  we recognize such milestone as revenue on a straight line basis over the remaining expected term of continued involvement in the research and development process 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met  the milestone is non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended  the other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated with the achievement of the milestone and any ongoing research and development or other services are priced at fair value 
payments received in advance of work performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
research and development expenses research and development costs include salaries  facilities expense  overhead expenses  material and supplies  pre clinical expense  clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing expenses  stock based compensation expense  contract services and other outside services 
on january   we adopted the financial accounting standards board s fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities 
all other costs are charged to expense as incurred 
intangible assets when we acquire development products  we allocate the purchase price  including acquisition expenses and assumed liabilities  to tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill 
the portion allocated to intangible assets may be allocated to trademarks  patents and other intangibles 
we estimate the useful lives of the assets by considering the remaining life of the patents  estimated future introductions of competing products  and other related factors 
because of the nature of pharmaceutical research  and particularly because of the difficulties associated with efficacy studies in humans related to the bioterrorist products with which we work and the government s related funding provisions  factors that affect the estimate of the life of the asset are often more uncertain than other non bioterrorist pharmaceutical research 
on an annual basis  we assess recoverability of intangibles from future operations  using undiscounted future cash flows derived from the intangible assets 
any impairment would be recognized in operating results to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value  which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows  in certain situations  where the carrying value is dependent upon the outcome of a single study and that study is unsuccessful  that impairment may be significant in amount and immediate in timing

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview our primary cash requirements are to fund our research and development programs  general and administrative expense  and acquisition activity 
our cash requirements in future periods could change materially as a result of changes in our business and strategy 
these changes could arise from our management team s evaluation of our business strategy  the progress of our research and development activities and clinical programs  licensing activities  acquisitions  divestitures or other corporate developments 
since inception in march  we have not generated positive cash flow 
to bridge the gap between payments made to us under our government contracts and grants and our operating and capital needs  we have had to rely on a variety of financing sources  including the issuance of equity securities and convertible notes  proceeds from loans and other borrowings  and the trust funds obtained in the merger 
for the foreseeable future  we will continue to need to utilize these types of financing vehicles and potentially others to help fund our future operating and capital requirements 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that we will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
we have incurred cumulative net losses and expect to incur additional losses in conducting further research and development activities 
we do not have commercial products and  given the substantial costs relating to the development of pharmaceutical products  have comparatively limited capital resources 
our plans with regard to these matters include continued development of our products as well as seeking additional funds to support our research and development efforts 
although we continue to pursue these plans  there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that we will be able to secure additional funding through government contracts and grants 
continuation of pharmathene as a going concern is dependent upon  among other things  the success of our research and development programs and our ability to obtain adequate financing 
our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability of the carrying amount of recorded assets and liabilities that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties 
on march   we closed on the public sale of an aggregate of  newly issued shares of our common stock at per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of  the warrants will be exercisable beginning on september  and will expire on september   five years from the date they become exercisable 
we intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes  including the satisfaction of existing obligations 
sources and uses of cash our cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of december  
table of contents from december  primarily was attributable to the following i a decrease of million  reflecting the million initial consideration paid in the avecia acquisition and the related funding of the million letter of credit  ii a decrease of million for the funding of operations  iii a decrease of million reflecting the funding of restricted cash obligations per our amended loan agreement with silicon valley bank and oxford finance corporation  iv a decrease of million relating to the repayment of debt  and v an increase of million in connection with the issuance of common stock and warrants as described below 
our short term investments were million and million at december  and  respectively 
on october   in exchange for gross proceeds of million  we sold and issued to a subsidiary of panacea biotec  shares of our common stock and a month warrant to purchase up to  additional shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share subject to a stock ownership cap  following any warrant exercises  of of our issued and outstanding common stock as of such exercise date 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash used in operations during the year ended december  reflects a net loss after the effect of non cash adjustments of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  and an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable of million 
non cash adjustments for the year ended december  included a charge to expense of acquired in process research and development of million as a result of the avecia acquisition  non cash stock compensation expense of million and non cash interest expense of million related to our convertible notes 
accounts receivable increased due to contract award receivables due from niaid related to the further development of sparvax and rypvax under contracts acquired in the second quarter of as part of the avecia acquisition and from dod related to increased activities for the advanced development of protexia 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased due to increased development activities primarily related to sparvax and rypvax and compliance related  bid and proposal and litigation expenses 
cash used in operations in reflects a net loss after the effect of non cash adjustments of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable of million 
non cash adjustments for the year ended december  included a million credit that resulted from the cancellation of former pharmathene s preferred stock warrants  a million gain on the extinguishment of debt  a million mark to market gain on derivative instruments and stock compensation expense of million 
accounts receivable increased due to contract award receivables due from the dod related to increased activities related to the advanced development of protexia 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased due to approximately million in increased development activities  approximately million for performance based employee bonuses  approximately million of deferred rent expenses related to the company s newly leased office space and approximately million in increased legal and other administrative activities 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  during the year of  we paid million to avecia and funded a million letter of credit in connection with the avecia acquisition 
additionally  we incurred approximately million related to transactions costs incurred as a result of the avecia acquisition 
in order to fund the avecia acquisition transaction and the restricted cash 
table of contents obligations pursuant to the loan modification agreement  approximately a net million of available for sale securities were sold 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the fourth quarter purchase of approximately million of available for sale securities 
the remaining million of investing activities for the period ended december  related to the purchase of property and equipment 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  as noted above  we issued  of common stock for net proceeds of million in the fourth quarter of additionally  we made principal repayments of million under outstanding credit facilities for the year ended december  we are a party to a million secured credit facility evidenced by a loan and security agreement  dated as of march  the loan agreement  with silicon valley bank and oxford finance corporation together  the lenders 
under the credit facility  we borrowed million  which bears interest at an annual rate of 
the loan agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants which  among other things  restrict our ability to undertake certain acquisitions  incur certain indebtedness or make certain investments 
as a consequence  we sought to obtain the consent of its lenders to the avecia acquisition and entered into a consent and first loan modification agreement  dated as of march   with the lenders 
we have made cumulative principal repayments of million through december  net cash provided by financing was million for the year ended december  financing resulted from the million of proceeds from the reverse merger with haq  and the million credit facility  partially offset by million in merger related costs and debt repayment of million 
future cash needs since inception in march  we have not generated positive cash flow 
to bridge the gap between payments made to us under our government contracts and grants and our operating and capital needs  we have had to rely on a variety of financing sources  including the issuance of equity securities and convertible notes  proceeds from loans and other borrowings  and the trust funds obtained in the merger 
for the foreseeable future  we will continue to need to utilize these types of financing vehicles and potentially others to help fund our future operating and capital requirements 
in evaluating alternative sources of financing  we consider  among other things  the dilutive impact  if any  on our stockholders  the ability to leverage stockholder returns through debt financing  the particular terms and conditions of each alternative financing arrangement and our ability to service our obligations under such financing arrangements 
as disclosed above  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the investment by panacea biotec s subsidiary in october  and million from our registered offering of securities in march however  as a result of our continuing losses and our continuing obligations  including those under the agreements relating to the avecia acquisition  without additional funding through contracts and grants with the us or foreign governments  we would need to identify additional financing within the next months 
the current turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or cease operations has resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of 
table of contents liquidity in many financial markets  and extreme volatility in fixed income  credit  currency and equity markets 
as a result  there can be no assurance that funding will be available to us on reasonably acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  due to the us government s substantial efforts to stabilize the economy  the us government may be forced or choose to reduce or delay spending in the biodefense field  which could decrease the likelihood of future government contract awards  the likelihood that the government will exercise its right to extend any of its existing contracts with us and or the likelihood that the government would procure products from us 
our requirements for additional capital may be substantial and will be dependent on many factors  including the success of our research and development efforts  our ability to commercialize and market products  our ability to successfully pursue our licensing and collaboration strategy  the receipt of continued government funding  competing technological and marketing developments  costs associated with the protection of our intellectual property  and any future change in our business strategy 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into facility and equipment operating lease agreements 
our obligations under these agreements are presented in this section under contractual obligations 
contractual obligations the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with leases  research and development arrangements  collaborative development obligations and long term debt contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating facility leases research and development agreements notes payable  including interest total contractual obligations this table does not include any royalty payments of future sales of products subject to license agreements we have entered into our in relation to our in licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments 
we believe that any interest rate change related to our investment securities held as of december  is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure or foreign currency exchange exposure  and the movement of foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse or positive impact on our results of operations 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a significant impact on the realized value of our investments 
our debt is at rates fixed by the lenders 
due to the short term nature of our debt  we do not believe an increase in the market rates would have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements
