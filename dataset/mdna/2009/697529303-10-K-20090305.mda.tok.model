the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report 
historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods 
critical accounting policies our policies are more fully described in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and is based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we recognize product revenues upon shipment 
if a product sale does not meet all of the above criteria  the revenue from the sale is deferred until all criteria are met 
provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for any applicable warranty costs expected to be incurred 
periodically  we sell products together with a product upgrade option that requires that the customer pay an upgrade fee at the time of exercise  has no refund provisions and includes an expiration date on the upgrade option 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we defer the fair value ascribed to the upgrade option until the expiration of the upgrade option or the exercise of the upgrade option and shipment of the product upgrade 
revenues from the sale of service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the service contract 
revenues from services administered by us that are not covered by a service contract are recognized as the services are provided 
in certain instances  we sell products together with service contracts 
we recognize revenue on such multiple element arrangements in accordance with sab and eitf  based on the relative fair market value of each element 
we generally recognize royalty revenue from licensees upon receipt of cash payments since the royalty amounts are not determinable at the end of a quarter 
licensees are obligated to make payments between and days after the end of each quarter 
if at the end of a quarter royalty revenue from licensees are determinable  we record royalty revenue during the period earned 
periodically  as we sign on new licensees  we recognize back owed royalties in the period in which it is determinable and earned 
we have the right under our license agreements to engage independent auditors to review the royalty calculations 
the amounts owed as a result of these audits may be higher or lower than previously recognized 
we have funded product development revenue from the development agreements with johnson johnson  procter gamble gillette  and the united states department of the army 
for both johnson johnson and gillette  we have received payments in accordance with the work plans that were developed with both johnson johnson and gillette 
revenue is recognized under the contracts as costs are incurred and services are rendered 
any amounts received in advance of costs incurred and services rendered are recorded as deferred revenue 
payments are not refundable if the development is not successful 
we have provided services under a million research contract with the united states department of the army to develop a light based self treatment device for pseudofolliculitis barbae or pfb 
the contract was a cost plus fee arrangement whereby we were reimbursed for the expenses incurred in connection with pfb research plus an fee 
revenue was recognized under the contract as the costs were incurred and the services were rendered 
our revenue from the contract is subject to government audit 
investments 
investment securities  which primarily consist of state and municipal auction rate securities and variable rate demand obligations  are classified as available for sale or marketable securities under provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and are recorded at fair market value 
we generally invest in short term investments that are highly liquid 
any unrealized gains and losses  net of income tax effects  would be computed on the basis of specific identification and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated statements of stockholder s equity 
we evaluate unrealized losses to determine if the loss is other than temporary 
if an unrealized loss is deemed other than temporary  we record the loss in the statement of operations 
accounts receivable reserves 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for customer receivable balances  we make assumptions with respect to their future collectibility 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
generally  these individual credit assessments occur prior to the inception of the credit exposure and at regular reviews during the life of the exposure and consider a a customer s ability to meet and sustain their financial commitments  b a customer s current and projected financial condition  c the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook  and d the economy in general 
once we consider all of these factors  a determination is made as to the probability of default 
an appropriate provision is made  which takes into account the severity of the likely loss on the outstanding receivable balance based on our experience in collecting these amounts 
our level of reserves for our customer accounts receivable fluctuates depending upon all of the factors mentioned above 
we provide an additional reserve for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  historical experiences of write offs and defaults 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular orders  analysis of credit memo data  and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
inventory reserves 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology equipment  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
included in our inventory are demonstration products that are used by our sales organization 
we account for such products as we do with any other finished goods item in our inventory in accordance with the review of our entire inventory 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although we perform a detailed review of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
warranty provision 
we typically offer either a one or three year warranty for our base products 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty reserves include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty repairs and the cost per repair 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our estimated warranty obligation is affected by ongoing product failure rates  specific product class failures outside of our baseline experience  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
assumptions and historical warranty experience are evaluated to determine the appropriateness of such assumptions 
we assess the adequacy of the warranty provision and we may adjust this provision if necessary 
stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights sar  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
on january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method as permitted under sfas r 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in includes compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas in accordance with the modified prospective method of adoption  our results of operations and financial position for prior periods have not been restated 
as permitted under sfas and sfas r  we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option and sar grants 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options and sars include the exercise price of the award  the expected option term  the expected volatility of our stock over the option or sar s expected term  the risk free interest rate over the option or sar s expected term and our expected annual dividend yield 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our common stock  the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options or sars granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns  and the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option or sar 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our income from operations  net income  and earnings per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods  and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option and sar grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options and sars  may expire with little or no intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  the value realized from these instruments may be significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
the guidance in sfas r is relatively new and the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
fair value measurements 
the performance of fair value measurements is an integral part of the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell or transfer such an asset or liability 
selection of the appropriate valuation technique  as well as determination of assumptions  risks and estimates used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability requires significant judgment 
although we believe that the inputs used in our valuation techniques are reasonable  a change in one or more of the inputs could result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of certain assets and certain liabilities and could have an impact on both our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
to value our auction rate securities  we determined the present value of the auction rate securities at the balance sheet date by discounting the estimated future cash flows based on a fair value rate of interest and an expected time horizon to liquidity 
as there is currently no active market for these investments  their valuation required management s judgment 
income taxes 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires us to maintain a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
for  we removed the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets based on the conclusion that there was sufficient positive evidence to support that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would be realized 
this resulted in a non cash  million tax benefit recorded through our provision for income taxes 
in  we incurred operating losses in foreign jurisdictions 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the associated tax asset will expire prior to utilization 
therefore  we have established a full valuation allowance in against this deferred tax asset 
in addition to the tax assets described above  we have deferred tax assets totaling million  resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
in accordance with sfas and sfas r  recognition of these assets would occur upon utilization of these deferred tax assets to reduce taxes payable and would result in a credit to additional paid in capital within stockholders equity rather than the provision for income taxes 
for  and  the impact to paid in capital resulting from the exercise of employee stock options was million  million and million  respectively 
in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions  we accrue charges for possible exposures 
based on the annual evaluations of tax positions  we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted 
contingencies 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we accrue for all direct costs associated with the estimated resolution of contingencies at the earliest date at which it is deemed probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated 
at december   we have not recorded any material loss contingencies 
overview we are engaged in research  development  manufacturing and distribution of proprietary light based systems for medical and cosmetic treatments 
since our inception  we have been able to develop a differentiated product mix of light based systems for various treatments through our research and development as well as with our partnerships throughout the world 
we are continually developing and testing new indications to further the advancement in light based treatments 
our total revenues for the year ended december   decreased by as compared to the same period in the factors driving this decrease were threefold a decline in product revenues was the result of challenging economic conditions which have caused many prospective customers to be unable to obtain financing and prompting others to delay their capital equipment purchases until economic conditions improve  a decline in royalty revenues was due to a smaller back owed royalties payment received of million in as compared to million in as well as our competitors being affected by the same challenging economic conditions which have depressed their product revenue sales which decreases the amount of royalties they owe us  and a decline in funded product development revenues occurred as since january  we are no longer receiving such payments from procter gamble 
offsetting the decrease in product  royalty  and funded product development revenues  other revenues increased by as compared to the same period in due to million of technology transfer payments in from procter gamble 
although was a very challenging year  we were able to maintain a strong balance sheet 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities 
our stockholders equity increased year over year 
our current ratio is x  down from x at the end of we had million of short term debt as of december  at december   we had no borrowings 
sales from our lux family of products weakened throughout due to the tightening of the credit market and prospective customers delaying buying decisions due to the downturn of the global economy 
the lux line of products consists of the starlux laser and pulsed light system  the medilux and the estelux pulsed light systems  including a base unit and multiple  optional handpieces 
during the third quarter of  we began shipping our latest technology platform  the aspire body sculpting system coupled with the slimlipo handpiece 
the slimlipo handpiece is our first minimally invasive product designed to provide laser assisted lipolysis

the downturn in the global economy in considerably affected the aesthetic laser industry and our product revenues 
a swift and severe decrease in revenue was seen across the sector in driven by the inability of many prospective customers to obtain financing and prompting others to delay their capital equipment purchases until economic conditions improve 
sales of our starlux laser and pulsed light systems  including a base unit and multiple  optional handpieces were the leading contributor to our product revenues 
product revenues were unfavorably impacted by a decrease of in sales related to the starlux laser and pulsed light system  a decrease of in revenue related to our other lux family of products  which includes the medilux and estelux  a decrease of from sales related to the q yag product line as compared to the same period in in april  we launched the aspire body sculpting system and slimlipo handpiece 
shipments began in the third quarter of the slimlipo handpiece is our first minimally invasive product which was designed to provide laser assisted lipolysis during liposuction procedures 
during the second half of  we recognized product revenue related to the aspire system and slimlipo handpiece 
customer service increased by as compared to the same period in international product revenue  consisting of revenue from our distributors in japan  europe  australia  asia pacific rim and south and central america and our sales shipped directly to international customers  was of total product revenue for the year ended in comparison to for the same period in royalty revenues 
royalty revenues decreased during in comparison to the same period in  mainly due to the recognition of million in back owed royalties received in offset by million in back owed royalties received in the back owed royalties in both years were from a patent settlement agreement executed in and these amounts were recognized as they became determinable based on the completion of an audit by an independent accounting firm during the first quarter of excluding back owed royalties in both periods  royalty revenues remained constant 
on april   we announced the resolution of our patent infringement and trade dress lawsuit against alma lasers  inc through the execution of a settlement agreement  a non exclusive patent license agreement and a trade dress settlement agreement 
under the patent license agreement  we granted alma a non exclusive  royalty bearing license to us patent nos 
 and  and all corresponding foreign patents and patent applications in the professional field  excluding the consumer field 
alma admitted that their products infringe these patents and that these patents are valid and enforceable 
in addition  alma agreed not to challenge the infringement  validity and enforceability of these patents in the future 
alma will pay for royalties and interest due on past sales of their laser and lamp based hair removal systems beginning with their initial sales in and a trade dress fee plus interest on past sales of their harmony and aria systems 
the amounts due to us were determined based on an audit by an independent accounting firm which was completed in the first quarter of we recognized royalty revenue as amounts became determinable 
under our license agreement with the massachusetts general hospital  we pay to the massachusetts general hospital of all patent royalty and interest thereof from alma 
starting on march   alma began paying us royalties on sales of its existing and any new light based hair removal systems later developed 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  for back owed royalties from alma 
funded product development revenues 
funded development revenue decreased during as compared to the same period in funded product development revenue is generated from the development agreements with johnson johnson consumer companies  inc  procter gamble and its wholly owned subsidiary the gillette company  and the united states department of the army 
during  we recognized approximately million and million of funded product development revenue from johnson johnson and procter gamble  respectively 
during  we recognized approximately million and million of funded product development revenue from johnson johnson and gillette  respectively 
the decrease in funded product development revenue from johnson johnson during was the result of the completion of several agreement amendments  offset by a new agreement amendment which started in the third quarter of the decrease in funded product development revenue from gillette during was the result of the termination of the development and license agreement with gillette in in  funded product development revenues consisted of the million go decision payment following fda otc clearance in december which was recognized throughout as we were obligated to perform additional services and remain exclusive with gillette during that period in consideration for this payment and the million amendment in february which was recognized throughout the remainder of as costs were incurred and services were provided

cost of product revenues 
the cost of product revenues decreased in absolute dollars  but increased as a percentage of product revenues to in from in which includes a million reduction related to royalties due to massachusetts general hospital after finalizing licensing negotiations 
excluding the million  the cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was in the decrease in absolute dollars was attributed to lower product revenues 
the increase as a percentage of product revenues is due to a shift in product sales to outside north america where we sell our products at fixed transfer prices 
cost of royalty revenues 
as a percentage of royalty revenues  the cost of royalty revenues was consistent at in accordance with our license agreement with massachusetts general hospital for the years ended december  and the decrease in the cost of royalty revenues in absolute dollars during as compared to is attributed to the decrease in royalty revenue recognized from our licensees  mainly due to the change in back owed royalties received in as compared to research and development expense 
the increase in research and development expense is a direct result of our spending related to the johnson johnson agreement and our continued commitment to introducing new platforms and enhancing our current family of products  offset by reduced expenses related to the completion of research contract with the united states department of the army and the termination of the development and license agreement with gillette both in for our johnson johnson joint development and license agreement  costs related to other clinical  consulting and overhead expenses increased by  additional labor hours worked increased by  and material costs decreased by  as compared to the same period in for our development and license agreement with gillette  costs decreased in by million as compared to due to the termination of the development and license agreement on february  for our research agreement with the united states department of the army  costs decreased in by  as compared to due to the completion of the research agreement on march  expenses relating to the introduction of new products  enhancements made to our current family of products and research and development overhead increased by  in comparison to the same period in this increase is attributed to increases in additional labor hours  material costs  other clinical  consulting and overhead expenses 
for the years ended december  and  research and development expense included million and  respectively of stock based compensation expense 
selling and marketing expense 
the decrease in selling and marketing expense is primarily comprised of million of commissions and  from consultants  offset by an increase of million from payroll and payroll related expenses of which million is due to higher stock based compensation expense 
included in these expenses for is approximately million related to our two foreign subsidiaries 
general and administrative expense 
the increase in general and administrative expense is mainly attributed to increases in our corporate legal expenses of million which excludes a  reimbursement net of payments owed to the massachusetts general hospital from alma in and payroll and payroll related expenses of million as well as a  decrease in allocated expenses 
offsetting these increases is a million decrease in incentive compensation and a million decrease in bad debt expense in comparison to the same period in for the years ended december  and  general and administrative expense included million and  respectively of stock based compensation expense 
interest income 
in comparison to the same period in  interest income in decreased due to a reduction in our cash balances and lower interest rates  offset by  net of payments owed to the massachusetts general hospital received related to back owed royalties from a new patent license agreement in under which we recognized  net of payments owed to the massachusetts general hospital related to back owed royalties in other income 
other income for the year ended december  includes the foreign exchange loss as a result of transactions in currencies other than the us dollar 
other income for the year ended december  includes  cash received related to the expiration of a standstill agreement and the foreign exchange gain as a result of transactions in currencies other than the us dollar 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to an effective tax rate for the year ended december  in and  our effective tax rate was less than the combined federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the benefit of research and development credits generated 
in addition  in  our effective tax rate was impacted by the valuation allowance we recorded related to foreign net operating losses 
although in  we have determined that a valuation allowance is not required with respect to our remaining deferred tax assets of million  their recovery is dependent on achieving the forecast of future operating income over a protracted period of time 
failure to achieve future operating income targets or negative changes to expected trends may change the assessment regarding the recoverability of the net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of the deferred tax assets 
any increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense and could have a significant impact on our earnings in future periods

sales of our starlux laser and pulsed light systems  including a base unit and multiple  optional handpieces were the leading contributor to our increase in product revenues 
product revenues were favorably impacted by an increase of in sales related to the starlux laser and pulsed light system and an increase of in revenue related to customer service  offset by a decrease of related to the other lux family of products  which includes the medilux and estelux  and a decrease of from sales related to the q yag product line as compared to the same period in starlux product sales increased as more customers opted for the higher powered  faster and more versatile starlux systems and related handpieces that are capable of utilizing both laser and lamp based applications to treat various cosmetic conditions 
the decline in revenues from other lux products was directly attributable to the customer acceptance of the starlux product line and its additional laser and light based handpieces 
international product revenue  consisting of revenue from our distributors in japan  europe  australia  asia pacific rim and south and central america and our sales shipped directly to international customers  was of total product revenue for the year ended in comparison to for the same period in royalty revenues

cutera paid us million as an estimated payment for royalties due on past sales of their laser and lamp based hair removal systems beginning with their initial sales in through march   interest and reimbursement of our legal costs 
cutera subsequently informed us that they believed the actual liability for past royalties  interest and legal costs was million  versus the actual payment of million 
we recorded the difference of million as deferred revenue at june  to be applied against future amounts owed  which was fully recognized as royalty revenue as of december  the final amounts due were subject to audit by an independent accounting firm which was completed during the fourth quarter of  resulting in an additional  of royalty and interest 
starting on april   cutera began paying us royalties on sales of its existing and any new light based hair removal systems later developed

the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to a tax benefit rate of for the year ended december  in  our effective tax rate was less than the combined federal and state statutory rates because of the benefit of research and development credits generated 
in the fourth quarter of  based on current and preceding years results of operations and anticipated profit levels in future periods  we believed that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized in the future and  accordingly  that it was appropriate to release the valuation allowance recorded against those deferred tax assets 
in reaching this conclusion  we weighed both negative and positive evidence regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets and considered the extent to which the evidence could be objectively verified

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and a decline in the stock market 
the current turbulence in the us and global financial markets has caused a decline in stock values across all industries 
we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our investment portfolio of cash equivalents  corporate preferred securities  and municipal debt securities is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial because of the historically short term nature of these investments 
at december   we held million in auction rate securities ars 
the ars we invest in are high quality securities  none of which are mortgage backed 
at december   because of the short term nature of our investment in these securities  they were classified as available for sale and included in short term investments on our consolidated balance sheets 
subsequent to december   our securities failed at auction due to a decline in liquidity in the ars and other capital markets 
we will not be able to access our investments in ars until future auctions are successful  ars are called for redemption by the issuers  or until sold in a secondary market 
as our investments in ars currently lack short term liquidity  we have reclassified these investments as non current as of december  during fiscal  we sold million of the ars held at december  the recovery of the remaining million ars held is based upon market factors which are not within our control 
our international subsidiaries in the netherlands and australia conduct business in both local and foreign currencies and therefore  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currencies 
this risk could adversely impact our results and financial condition 
we have not entered into any foreign currency exchange and option contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk and the corresponding variability in operating results as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
