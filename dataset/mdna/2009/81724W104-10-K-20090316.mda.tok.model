overview we develop  manufacture and sell minimally invasive medical devices that are used in the diagnosis of breast cancer 
we were incorporated in from our inception until  our principal activity was the development and regulatory clearance of our initial products  primarily our biopsy tissue markers and our first breast biopsy system  the encor we launched our first biopsy tissue markers in and our encor in the encor hardware subsequently served as a platform to facilitate the later launch of the encor probes  handpieces and other probes  which are compatible with the major imaging modalities 
in  we received k clearance from the fda to market our encor breast biopsy system  our flagship product for use in breast biopsy procedures  conducting market preference testing commencing in the fourth quarter of over the subsequent period ending in october  we began selling the product on a limited basis while we focused on enhancing certain components of the product to optimize its performance  and we subsequently progressed with a full commercial launch of our encor system in november we have and are continuing to develop minimally invasive products for surgical excision of lesions and for breast cancer treatment 
we received k clearance for our contura multi lumen radiation balloon catheter  or contura mlb  in may and launched in january contura mlb is one of a new class of devices designed to reduce radiation treatment time to five days from six to eight weeks in patients eligible for the treatment 
we also believe that contura mlb may present radiation oncologists with opportunities to optimize dosing for certain patients 
we are also developing next generation tissue marker products  additional encor line extensions  line extensions of contura mlb  devices to assist in lesion location and certain radio frequency based excision and reconstructive tissue cutting devices 
before  we had historically derived our revenues primarily from our tissue marker products 
however  our encor system accounted for a majority of our revenue growth in our ability to continue to grow revenues is based upon a number of assumptions  which may not ultimately occur  including retention of our sales force  growth in the market for minimally invasive breast biopsy procedures and rapid adoption of the product by physicians who specialize in breast care 
we expect our contura mlb to increasingly contribute to our revenues and we are marketing this device as a compelling alternative to competing devices 
for the year ended december   we generated net revenues of million and a net loss of million 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have not been profitable since inception 
we expect our operating expenses to increase as we expand our business to meet anticipated increased demand for our encor system  expand sales of our contura mlb and devote resources to our sales and marketing and research and development activities 
net revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the sales of our breast biopsy systems  breast biopsy capital equipment  our tissue markers  and other products for breast care 
our largest market for these products is in the united states and canada  where we employ a direct sales force 
our breast biopsy systems  the encor and encor  consist of two primary components reusable handpieces and disposable probes  and are used in conjunction with our senorx breast biopsy console 
the disposable probes form the basis of a recurring revenue stream and also contribute to the sales of tissue markers 
diagnostic adjunct revenue consists primarily of tissue marker sales  both used with our breast biopsy systems and with competitor s biopsy products 
our breast biopsy capital equipment includes a reusable handpiece  a control module and vacuum source used in conjunction with our disposable biopsy probe 
we expect that the sales of biopsy disposable and biopsy capital equipment will grow materially in we further expect that the sales of our adjunct products  such as our tissue markers and gamma finder  will grow modestly 
we anticipate that contura mlb will provide meaningful revenue increases in versus cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold consists of the cost to manufacture and assemble our products  primarily including materials  components and labor 
we assemble and package all of our finished products with the exception of our gamma finder product 
we expect that our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues will decrease  and  correspondingly  gross profits will increase  as a percentage of net revenues with increased sales volume  product enhancements and outsourced manufacturing efficiencies 
at the end of  we entered into an agreement with a contract manufacturer in thailand and began to transfer a portion of our manufacturing for certain components of our products to this site  and we anticipate that we will transfer additional manufacturing to this site in order to increase gross margins 
we anticipate that our gross margin will continue to increase in versus due to design and production process improvements  changes in product mix  the manufacturing efficiencies that we expect to see with increased production  and the continued successful transfer of manufacturing of certain products and product components to our thailand contract manufacturer 
operating expenses our operating expenses consist of research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
stock based compensation  a non cash item  is primarily included in these expenses 
our selling and marketing expenses consist of salaries and related expenses of our direct sales team and sales management  travel  clinical education and training expenses  marketing and promotional expenses  and costs associated with tradeshows 
we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute terms as we expand our sales organization and promotional activities  although at a rate less than our revenue growth rate 
our research and development expenses consist of salaries and related expenses of our research and development personnel and consultants and costs of product development  which include patent filing and maintenance costs  production engineering  clinical and regulatory support and post clearance clinical product enhancements 
we expense all our research and development costs as they are incurred 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute terms and as a percent of revenues in as we continue to develop  enhance  obtain clinical results and commercialize existing and new products 
our general and administrative expenses consist of the cost of corporate operations  litigation and professional services 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we increase our infrastructure to comply with the regulatory requirements associated with publicly traded companies and anticipated litigation expenses relating to the current hologic patent infringement lawsuit 
during  we incurred million in patent litigation expenses related to alleged patent infringement by hologic 
on october   a markman claims construction hearing was held and a ruling was issued on february  although we  together with our legal counsel  continue to evaluate the court s ruling in the markman hearing  we expect that nothing material or definitive in the matter will be decided before the trial  the date for which has not yet been set by the court 
as a result  we believe that the probability of incurring any loss related to this litigation is not determinable  nor is the amount of loss quantifiable at this time 
accordingly  we have not accrued a loss related to this litigation as of december  we expect to incur stock based compensation expense for option grants  which will be accounted for under sfas no 
r 
we anticipate that non cash expenses for options accounted for under sfas no 
r will increase in based upon the number of options granted 
we also expect to incur stock based compensation expense related to the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
interest interest income represents income generated from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments that are invested generally in liquid money market funds and commercial paper 
during  debt obligations included a working capital facility  and an equipment facility resulting in interest expense 
interest expense also includes the fair value for any equity interests  such as warrants  granted in conjunction with the debt obligations 
the fair value of the equity interests were amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt obligations 
interest expense has decreased due to the retirement of certain debt obligations in and early and lower available interest rates 
income tax expense due to uncertainty surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets through future taxable income  we have provided a full valuation allowance and no benefit has been recognized for our net operating loss and other deferred tax assets 
income tax expense relates to certain state taxes

research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased  or  to in from million in the decrease in these expenses consisted primarily of project costs  predominately for the contura mlb  which decreased  and a decrease of  in equity based compensation 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of  for salaries and the related employee costs  a  increase for patent related expenses and an increase of  in departmental related expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase primarily consisted of million in attorney and related litigation costs incurred in connection with responding to the allegations by hologic of patent infringement relating to our contura mlb   for public company related costs  including legal and reporting expenses  which includes first year sarbanes oxley implementation costs   for salaries and the related employee costs   for departmental costs and  for increased professional fees 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to  in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the repayment of the december subordinated note 
loss on debt extinguishment 
in november  we incurred a million expense on the retirement of a december subordinate note facility that had an original principal amount of million outstanding under it  representing the unamortized debt issuance and debt discounts which would have been otherwise charged to interest expense over the term of the facility 
in  we did not incur any expense related to this item 
change in fair value of convertible promissory notes and warrant valuation

 and income of  for the reduction in the fair value of a related warrant liability 
in  we did not incur any expense related to this item 
interest income 
interest income decreased million to  in from million in primarily due to lower cash and short term investment balances resulting from the repayment of million for the retirement of the december subordinated note  million to repay a february convertible subordinated note and note obligations owing to century medical  as well as working capital needs

gross profit increased million or in to million from million in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased by to in from in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was primarily attributable to improved efficiencies in the production of our disposable biopsy probe and allocating manufacturing overhead over greater product revenues and inventory unit production 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase primarily consisted of million in salaries and related employee costs due to the expansion of our sales organization   in equity based compensation charges including deferred compensation and the discount associated with shares purchased by employees under our employee stock purchase plan and  increase in selling and promotional related expenses 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to in from million in the increase in these expenses primarily consisted of  in salaries and the related employee costs   associated with project costs for the development of the contura mlb  senosonix and visiloc  and a  increase in equity based compensation charges including deferred compensation and the discount associated with shares purchased by employees under our employee stock purchase plan

loss on debt extinguishment 
in november  we incurred a million expense on the retirement of the december subordinate note  representing the unamortized debt issuance and debt discounts which would have been otherwise charged to interest expense over the term of the note

in  we recorded income of  for the change in fair value of our may notes in accordance with fas no 
and income of  for the reduction in the fair value of the related warrant liability 
in  we recorded a million expense for the changes in fair value of our may notes 
interest income 
interest income increased million to million in from  in primarily as a result of increased interest income from higher cash and short term investment balances resulting from our ipo  which closed in april liquidity and capital resources general we have incurred losses since our inception in january and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
from inception through december   we generated cumulative gross profit from the sale of our product offerings of million 
to date  our operations have been funded primarily with proceeds from the issuance of our preferred stock and borrowings  including our issuance of the may notes and the december subordinated note  and our ipo that closed in april cumulative net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock totaled million 
proceeds from the issuance of the may notes totaled million 
proceeds from the issuance of the december subordinated note was million  of which million was used to repay the subordinated note payable 
net proceeds from our ipo  including the sale of shares pursuant to the subsequent underwriters overallotment and after deducting total expenses  was million 
all of our preferred stock converted into common stock upon the closing of the ipo 
in november we used million to retire the december subordinated note and in february we used million to repay the february convertible subordinated note and note obligations owing to century medical 
in september we amended our existing loan agreement with silicon valley bank  or svb  to among other items  increase the total maximum amount available for borrowing from million to million 
as of december   million has been drawn down under this facility 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  and our anticipated ability to draw down on our working capital and equipment facilities  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next months 
we anticipate that we will continue to use cash in our operating activities and investing activities for the foreseeable future as we grow our business 
net cash used in operating activities year ended net cash used in operating activities was million  for the year ended december   which was primarily a function of an increase in inventory of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in other assets of  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses of  and an increase in deferred revenue of  the aggregate increased investment in inventory of million resulted primarily from two major factors  including i our decision to build shelf stock for our higher volume products in order to better service our customers as well as accommodate our move to the new manufacturing facility in late august  and ii the need to purchase longer term quantities of certain parts due to long lead times 
we expect inventory will modestly decrease in the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in net sales and an increase in sales outside the united states  which include extended payment terms for initial stocking orders 
while we expect that the amount of accounts receivable will fluctuate based on the timing of sales and collections  we expect our ratio of overall investment in accounts receivable as compared to revenues will continue to modestly increase 
the  decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulted from the use of funds  including funds borrowed under our bank loan facility with svb that allowed us to reduce outstanding accounts payable with certain vendors 
net cash provided by investing activities year ended net cash provided by investing activities amounted to million during the year ended december   was primarily attributable to the maturities of short term investments which was partially offset by the  addition of new manufacturing molds and equipment  business intelligence software  leasehold improvements to our new irvine facility and demonstration units 
net cash provided by financing activities year ended net cash provided by financing activities was  during the year ended december   primarily attributable to million advance on our term loan and  related to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock from option exercises and espp stock purchases 
these proceeds were partially offset by the repayment of million for the century medical notes and  cash paid for the annual renewal of the svb working capital facility 
net cash used in operating activities year ended net cash used in operating activities was million  for the year ended december   which was a function of an increase in inventory of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and an increase in prepaid expenses of  these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in other assets of  and an increase in deferred revenue of  the aggregate increased investment in inventory of million resulted primarily from two major factors  including our decision to build shelf stock of our higher volume products in order to better service our customers  and the need to purchase longer term quantities of certain parts due to long lead times 
we expect inventory will continue to increase in the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in net sales 
while we expect that the amount of accounts receivable will fluctuate based on the timing of sales and collections  we expect our ratio of overall investment in accounts receivable as compared to revenues will remain constant as compared to the  decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulted from the use of proceeds from our april ipo  which allowed us to reduce outstanding accounts payable with certain vendors 
net cash used in investing activities year ended net cash used in investing activities amounted to million during the year ended december   primarily attributable to the purchase of short term investments and the addition of demonstration units and new manufacturing molds 
net cash provided by financing activities year ended net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december   primarily attributable to proceeds of million from our april ipo and underwriters overallotment  a million advance on our working capital facility and  related to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock from option exercises 
these proceeds were partially offset by an aggregate of million in repayments under our various debt facilities and  in cash paid for deferred offering costs including legal  accounting and printing fees  which were offset against offering proceeds at the completion of our ipo in april net cash used in operating activities years ended net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  the net cash used primarily reflects the net loss for the period  offset in part by depreciation  amortization of deferred compensation and amortization of debt discounts and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash used in our operating activities increased from million in to million in due to changes in assets and liabilities  which was a function of an increase in inventory of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
the aggregate increased investment in inventory of million resulted primarily from three major factors  including our requirement to purchase inventory from a distributor earlier than needed  our decision to build shelf stock of our higher volume products in order to better service our customers  and the need to purchase longer term quantities of certain parts due to long lead times 
net cash used in investing activities years ended net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  during the year ended december   cash used consisted of  for new molds  equipment and machinery   for demonstration units   for new computers and software   for a trade show booth and equipment  and  for leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities years ended net cash provided by financing activities was million in the increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to the proceeds of million related to the december subordinated note  million related to the may convertible promissory notes  an aggregate of million in borrowings under our various debt facilities and  related to proceeds from the issuance of common stock from option exercises 
these sources of cash were offset by million in scheduled debt repayments and the early repayment of the subordinated note payable  million in cash paid for deferred offering costs including legal  accounting and printing fees  which were at the time to be reclassified as additional paid in capital at the completion of the ipo  and  for payment of debt issuance costs 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable days outstanding were days at december   days at december  and days at december  our products are typically sold for terms net days from shipment 
we review our accounts receivable balances and customers regularly to establish and maintain an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts 
our account analysis includes reviewing the customer s historical payment history  the amount and number of days an account is outside of payment terms  the magnitude of the account balance  historical order patterns and any specific knowledge about the customer s financial condition 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross receivables was  and at december   and  respectively 
our reserve requirements are based on our review of every account and we place particular emphasis on each customer account with an account receivable balance more than days old and on that customer s specific payment history and other financial information 
as our revenues increase  we anticipate our days sales outstanding will fluctuate moderately 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations at december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total the operating leases shown above reflect payments related to our real estate lease in irvine  california  which expire in january and will amount to million over the month duration of the lease commencing in november working capital facility with silicon valley bank 
we have a working capital facility with silicon valley bank that  as a result of amendments to this facility in february and september  has an aggregate limit of million 
in connection with the september amendment  we also entered into an export import bank of the united states working capital guarantee program borrower agreement  which helped increase the total maximum amount available for borrowing under the facility  which is now million 
previously  the company s credit facility with svb provided for a maximum borrowing amount of million 
revolving line 
the svb facility provides for a domestic receivables based revolving line of credit in an aggregate amount of up to million  or  if less  the sum of of eligible domestic accounts receivable plus of eligible domestic inventory  coupled with a foreign receivables based revolving line of credit  guaranteed by export import bank of the united states  in an aggregate amount of up to million  or if less  the sum of of eligible foreign accounts receivable plus of eligible export related inventory 
no more than million  in the aggregate  will be available for combined draw downs under these two revolving lines of credit  a maturity date of september and bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate plus at december   provided that the annual rate will increase to prime rate plus if a financial ratio relating to our liquidity falls below a specified level 
interest is due monthly  with the balance due at the maturity date 
the domestic portion of revolving line is subject to a million sublimit available for cash management services provided by svb  including the issuance of short term letters of credit and foreign exchange contracts 
at december   there was million available to borrow on the revolving line 
term loan 
the svb facility also provides for a term loan in an aggregate amount of up to million  with a maturity date of march  provided that if the revolving line is not renewed at its maturity date  all amounts outstanding under the term loan will become due at such time 
the term loan bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate plus at december   provided that the annual rate applicable to the term loan increases to an annual rate equal to the prime rate plus if a financial ratio relating to our liquidity falls below a specified level 
a single advance is permitted and was drawn down in november monthly payments of interest only on the amount outstanding are due through march  followed by forty eight consecutive monthly installments of amortized principal and interest through the maturity date 
the full million was outstanding at december  loan agreement obligations 
the obligations under the svb facility are secured by security interest on substantially all of our assets  excluding intellectual property for which we gave a negative pledge against encumbering 
the svb facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants  including  among others  financial covenants requiring a minimum tangible net worth and a minimum liquidity ratio  and covenants limiting our ability to dispose of assets  make acquisitions  be acquired  incur indebtedness  grant liens or enter into negative pledge agreements  make investments  make distributions in respect of our capital stock including repurchases of such capital stock or enter into transactions with affiliates 
the svb facility also contains events of default that include  among others  failure to make payments when due  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  violation of covenants  events constituting a material adverse change  bankruptcy and insolvency events  material judgments  and cross defaults to certain other agreements 
the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of our obligations and an increase to the applicable interest rate  and would permit svb to exercise remedies with respect to the collateral 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in material off balance sheet activities  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
income taxes realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the timing and amount of our future earnings  if any 
accordingly  we have established full deferred tax asset valuation allowances as of december   and to reflect these uncertainties 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  and million in federal tax credit carryforwards and million in state tax credit carryforwards 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in the state tax credit carryforwards do not expire 
the utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code 
this annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before we are able to utilize them 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in doing so  we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to our audited financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b title has transferred  c the fee is fixed or determinable  and d collectability is reasonably assured 
our recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our operations and the timing of revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as sales commissions 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenues could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
for those sales that include multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair values of the individual components as determined in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
when more than one element  such as hardware and disposables  are contained in a single arrangement  revenues are allocated between the elements based on each element s relative fair value  provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in the absence of fair value for a delivered element  we allocate revenue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and allocate the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
in the absence of fair value for an undelivered element  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in a deferral of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until all undelivered elements have been fulfilled 
we place certain equipment with customers in return for the customer purchasing a minimum number of disposable devices during a specified contract period 
title to the equipment passes to the customer at the end of the contract period if the minimum purchase requirements are met 
the cost of the equipment  which is included in other long term assets in the accompanying balance sheets  is amortized to cost of goods sold based on the monthly disposable unit shipments compared to the total purchase commitment of disposables 
in the event the customer does not fulfill the minimum purchase requirements  collection efforts may be undertaken and we will attempt to recover the equipment 
if the collection efforts or recovery of the equipment is not successful  the unamortized equipment cost would be expensed to cost of goods sold 
deferred revenue we also account for a customer s advance payment on product purchases as deferred revenue 
as product is purchased  the applicable sales value is recognized as revenue 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas r  which requires that all stock based compensation to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be expensed in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
under sfas r  we estimate the fair value of each stock based payment award using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we did not have a history of market prices of our common stock as we were not a public company until our april initial public offering  and as such  we estimate volatility in accordance with sab no 
using historical volatilities of other publicly traded companies in our industry 
the expected life of the awards is based on the simplified method as defined in sab no 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of not paying any dividends 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we recognized stock based compensation expense in our financial statements based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
a summary of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the options is as follows year ended december  expected life years risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield forfeiture rate if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly form what we recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant addition equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 
inventories we assess the recoverability of our inventories at least quarterly through a review of inventory levels in relation to foreseeable demand  generally over twelve months 
foreseeable demand is based upon all available information  including sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycle information 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand  we write down the value of those inventories which  at the time of our review  we expect to be unable to sell 
the amount of the inventory write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand or product pricing is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
further  on a quarterly basis  we assess the net realizable value of our inventories 
when the estimated average selling price  plus costs to sell our inventory  falls below our inventory cost  we adjust our inventory to its current estimated market value 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we use a specific identification method for some items  and a percentage of aged receivables for others 
the percentages are determined based on our past experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses might exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
software development certain of our products incorporate software which is incidental to the product as a whole 
software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as research and development costs 
we define the establishment of technological feasibility as the completion of a final working model that has been incorporated into a product that has been cleared by the fda  at which time the product can be sold to third parties 
as a result  we have expensed all software development costs 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including fixed assets  are continually monitored and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we determine fair value by using available market data  comparable asset quotes and or discounted cash flow models 
deferred income taxes we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance is based upon our history of operating results  expectations of future taxable income and the ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies available to us 
in the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged against income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  in the event we were to determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 
fair value of financial instruments at each reporting date  we were required to estimate the fair value of our may convertible promissory notes in its entirety with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations 
our estimate of fair value was based upon a valuation which encompasses the probability weighted scenarios of the conversion features  as well as the timing and method of payment of interest associated with our may notes 
at each reporting date  we were also required to estimate the fair value of the warrant issued in conjunction with our subordinated note 
our estimate of fair value was determined using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires inputs for risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility  the life of the warrant and the fair value of the underlying security

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of marketable securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and corporate debt securities and us government securities 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december   included liquid money market accounts 
due to the liquid nature of our cash and cash equivalents  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk 
additionally  since the majority of our debt carries interest at fixed rates  we also believe changes in interest rates will not cause significant changes in our interest expense 
our revenues are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
we expect to continue to realize our revenues in us dollars
