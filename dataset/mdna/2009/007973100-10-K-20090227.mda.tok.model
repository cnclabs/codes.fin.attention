see business special note regarding forward looking statements in item of this report for additional factors relating to such statements  and see risk factors beginning on page for a discussion of certain risks applicable to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
business overview and presentation we design  manufacture  sell and support industrial power conversion products that transform power into various usable forms 
our products enable manufacturing processes that use thin film deposition for various products  such as semiconductor devices  flat panel displays  solar panels and architectural glass  as well as grid tie power conversion in the solar market 
we also supply gas flow control technology and thermal instrumentation products for control and detection of gases in the thin film deposition process for these same markets 
our global network of service centers provides local repair and field service capability in key regions 
our installed base provides a recurring revenue opportunity as we offer repair services  conversions  upgrades and refurbishments 

table of contents in  there were adverse changes in the overall business climate which caused deterioration in the markets in which we operate and as a result our revenues have declined substantially 
our analysis presented below is organized to provide the information we believe will be instructive for understanding the relevant trends going forward 
however  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  including the notes thereto 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain data derived from our consolidated statements of operations years ended december  in thousands sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenues represented by certain items reflected in our statements of operations years ended december  sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss 
table of contents sales the following tables summarize annual net sales  and percentages of net sales  by customer type for each of the years ended  and years ended december  increase decrease percentage change v v v v in thousands in thousands semiconductor capital equipment non semiconductor equipment total sales years ended december  semiconductor capital equipment non semiconductor equipment we provide product and services to a diverse range of markets and geographic regions with semiconductor capital equipment being our largest market  while sales to the solar market grew to become our second largest market during total sales decreased by million  or  in compared to and by million  or  in as compared to  primarily as a result of a weakened demand in the semiconductor capital equipment market 
sales to the semiconductor capital equipment market decreased by million  or  in as compared to and by million  or  in as compared to applied materials inc  our largest customer  accounted for million  or  of our sales in  as compared to million  or  of our sales in and million  or  in our sales to applied materials include sales for the semiconductor capital equipment market  as well as the solar and flat panel display markets 
sales to customers in the non semiconductor markets accounted for in  in and in this shift in the balance of our business partially offset the decline in the semiconductor capital equipment market 
the markets that comprise our non semiconductor markets include solar  flat panel display  data storage  architectural glass  and other industrial thin film manufacturing equipment 
our customers in these markets  other than the solar market  are predominantly large original equipment manufacturers oem s for new equipment 
the solar market was our fastest growing market in and overall  product sales to customers in the solar market  which is included in non semiconductor revenue above  comprised in  in and in our investments in capacity for solar panel production lines have driven this growth in revenue 
our products are used in leading thin film solar cell production technologies  such as polysilicon  copper indium gallium selenide cigs  copper indium selenide cis and cadmium telluride 
sales of our solaron solar inverter are included in sales to the solar market 
although we experienced growth in our non semiconductor business in  demand for our products is driven by requirements for capacity expansion in each of the markets we serve 
we expect near term weakness in from the softness in the global economy that may impact our customers expansion plans  coupled with difficulties in obtaining capital and deteriorating market conditions which may lead to the inability of our customers to obtain financing  resulting in a reduction of our sales to the non semiconductor markets 
we do  however  anticipate a continued shift in our business towards our non semiconductor markets as we continue to invest in new technology and products for the solar market 
gross profit our gross profit was  or in  million  or in  and million  or in the decrease in our gross profit  in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  in as compared to was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue in the semiconductor capital equipment market which impacted utilization and additional costs incurred in transitioning additional manufacturing from the united states to shenzhen  china as well as a decrease in the value of the us dollar  which resulted in increased material costs from our key european and japanese suppliers 
additionally  as a result of the weakening global economy  current market conditions and changing customer demand  we reviewed our end of life product and inventory strategies and our excess and obsolete inventory reserve policies 
we determined that the uncertain market conditions negatively affected the longer term demand for our parts and components on hand 
this change in estimate resulted in an approximately million increase to our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  therefore increasing cost of goods sold and decreasing gross profit 

table of contents the decrease in our gross profit  in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  in as compared to was primarily attributable to lower revenue which impacted utilization as well as the cost incurred for the transition of manufacturing from stolberg  germany to shenzhen  china and an additional charge of million related to a change in estimates of warranty expenses for two products 
operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the years ended  and years ended december  in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges total operating expenses research and development the market for our products is characterized by ongoing technological changes 
we believe that continued and timely development of new  highly differentiated products and enhancements to our existing products in support of customer requirements is necessary for us to maintain a competitive position in the markets we serve 
accordingly  we continue to devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development projects and seek to maintain close relationships with our customers and other industry leaders in order to remain responsive to their current and future product requirements 
we believe that the continued investment in research and development and ongoing development of new products are essential to the expansion of our markets  and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development activities 
all of our research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
research and development costs were million  or of sales  in  million  or of sales  in and million  or of sales  in the increase in both periods is a result of increases in compensation and material expenses related to the development of new platforms and the costs associated with the sustaining engineering of existing platforms 
research and development costs have supported business growth opportunities  including the development and release of several new power conversion platforms including paramount  an advanced rf power supply  and solaron  our transformerless photovoltaic pv inverter 
we expect to continue these investments in order to deliver an expanded product suite to many of the markets we currently serve 
selling  general and administrative our selling expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities that include personnel  trade shows  advertising  third party sales representative commissions  and other selling and marketing activities 
our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide corporate  legal  tax  financial  governance  administrative  information systems and human resource functions in addition to our general management 
selling  general and administrative costs were million  or of sales  in  million  or of sales  in and million  or of sales  in the decrease in selling  general and administrative costs in as compared to was a result of the reductions of personnel and related costs aimed at reducing administrative burden and increasing efficiencies 
we have also implemented cost reductions in all discretionary spending areas  such as travel  trade shows and professional fees 
additionally  third party sales compensation to independent sales representatives was lower due to a decrease in overall sales revenue 
as part of our cost reduction efforts in related to general and administrative expenses  we continue to consolidate worldwide accounting processing functions in a shared services center in shenzhen  china 

table of contents the increase in selling  general and administrative costs in as compared to was driven by increased fees related to audit and legal services as well as compensation expense  offset by decreases in insurance expense  property tax expense and depreciation 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in  million in and million in this amortization is related to the value of non technology related assets  such as contracts and non compete agreements  and were acquired in connection with previously completed acquisitions 
restructuring charges restructuring costs are related to actions we took primarily in response to downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
these costs were incurred to exit an activity or cancel an existing contractual obligation  including the closure of facilities and employee termination related charges 
during  we recognized restructuring costs of million  of which million was associated with global cost reduction plans implemented at various times throughout the year made through job elimination 
the remaining million of restructuring charges recognized in was a result of a plan to transition the production of a number of our legacy products from our manufacturing facility in fort collins  colorado to our manufacturing facility in shenzhen  china 
this activity in led to the elimination of approximately positions on a worldwide basis 
in  we closed our operation in stolberg  germany 
related to this closure  we recorded restructuring charges of million  consisting primarily of impairment on real and personal property and employee severance and benefit costs associated with the reduction of employees at the facility 
other income expense other income expense consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous gains  losses  income and expense items 
other income was million in  million in and million in the decrease of million in as compared to was primarily driven by a million decrease in interest income and a net million loss related to the valuation of our auction rate securities and put agreement 
the decrease related to interest income was a result of lower interest rate opportunities being offered in the financial markets and a decrease in our invested funds due to a million buyback of the company s stock 
the increase of million in as compared to was driven by a million increase in interest income  which resulted from higher interest rates on short term securities as well as an improved cash position of investable cash over the comparable period 
this increase was offset by a million increase in foreign exchange loss 
these losses were attributable to an increase in realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses  primarily related to the japanese yen  korean won and the euro strengthening relative to the us dollar 
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  computed at the enacted tax rates for the periods in which the assets or liabilities will be realized  as well as for the expected tax benefit of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
prior to december   management could not conclude that it was more likely than not that these net deferred tax assets would be realized 
based on our and operating results  our management  in accordance with sfas no 
 evaluated the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and concluded that it was more likely than not that the majority of net deferred tax assets would be realized  resulting in a reduction in the valuation allowance of million during the year ended december  based on our operating results and projection of future operating results within the united states  our management evaluated the recoverability of our deferred tax assets in the united states and concluded a portion of our us deferred tax assets were not recoverable under the more likely than not criteria in sfas as such  an increase to the valuation allowance of million dollars was recorded during the year ended december  the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of 
table of contents approximately million of future taxable income in the us  the timing and amount of which is uncertain 
we assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
if our expectation of future realization of our deferred tax assets changes  we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding change in income tax expense in such period 
the income tax expense of million in represents an effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of 
the income tax expense of million in represents an effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of 
the income tax benefit of million in represents an effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of 
the increase in the effective tax rate in as compared to resulted primarily from the recording of the additional valuation allowance discussed above and a change in the profitability mix between the us and our global subsidiaries  whereby more income was generated at our lower income tax subsidiaries during than in the comparable period 
the negative rate in includes the impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance discussed above 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations was million in from the release of funds held in escrow relating to the emco product line sold in goodwill impairment we experienced a cyclical slowdown in demand during fiscal that has continued into the first quarter of as a result  our market capitalization has declined below the levels of our carrying value of the company 
as of february   our market capitalization was below our carrying value and our goodwill may be impaired 
we expect to proceed with step two of the goodwill impairment analysis during the first quarter of  which may result in an impairment charge of up to million in quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly results in dollars and as a percentage of sales for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information 
due to the volatility of the industries in which our customers operate  the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent period

 percentage of sales sales gross profit restructuring income loss from operations net income loss impact of inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
however  we continuously monitor operating price increases  particularly in connection with the supply of component parts used in our manufacturing process 
to the extent permitted by competition  we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales prices over time 
sales price increases  however  were not significant in any of the years presented herein 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  sfas r as part of a joint project with the international accounting standards board 
sfas r provides for several significant changes to existing accounting practices 
table of contents for business combinations 
most notably  i acquisition related transaction costs  such as legal and professional fees  shall be expensed rather than accounted for as part of the acquisition cost  ii acquired in process research and development shall be capitalized rather than expensed at the acquisition date  and iii contingent consideration shall be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date rather than the points in time that payment becomes probable 
sfas r applies to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the adoption of sfas r will likely impact our results of operations and financial position to the extent that we make acquisitions subsequent to december  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas on january  sfas defines fair value  establishes a market based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas does not expand or require any new fair value measures  however the application of this statement may change current practice 
in february  the fasb decided that an entity need not apply this standard to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis until accordingly  our adoption of this standard in was limited to financial assets and liabilities  which primarily affects the valuation of our foreign currency contracts and marketable securities 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards that require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under sfas  a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  equity method investments  accounts payable  guarantees and issued debt 
other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and non cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services 
if the use of fair value is elected  any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred  such as debt issuance costs 
the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we have elected this fair value option for the put agreement entered into with the financial institution that manages our ars 
our ars holdings to which the put agreement relates have a cost basis of approximately million and a fair value at december  of approximately million 
we expect that the value of the put agreement and subsequent changes in the value of the put agreement will largely offset the other than temporary impairment on the ars and subsequent fair value movements of the ars  subject to the continued expected performance by the financial institution of its obligations under the agreement 
the fair value of the put agreement as of december  was million 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement requires additional disclosures regarding the effect of hedging activities on a company s results 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   which would be our first quarter of the implementation of this standard will impact our disclosures about our derivative instruments  including our forward currency contracts 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp 
fsp amends the factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this new guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions 
fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  early adoption is prohibited 
we are evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of fsp on our financial position and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp fas 
fsp fas clarified the application of fas fsp fas demonstrated how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive 
fsp fas was effective upon issuance  including for prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
our ars holdings to which this relates have a cost basis of approximately million and a fair value of approximately million at december  from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  our management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are our available cash and investments 
we utilize these capital resources to make capital expenditures primarily for our operational needs  investment in technology applications and tools to further develop our products and for other general corporate purposes  which have included repurchase of our common stock in the open market and acquisitions 
in future periods  we intend similar uses of these funds 
during  we generated million from the sale of marketable securities  million in cash from operating activities and million in cash from the issuance of stock under our employee equity plans 
further  we used million in cash for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock  purchased million of marketable securities  used million for capital expenditures and used million in other financing activities  resulting in a million increase in available cash including the favorable effects of international currency exchange rates on cash of million 
net cash flows provided by operating activities in were million  compared to million in and million in the million decrease in net cash flows from operating activities was due to a million decrease in net income after adjusting for non cash reconciling items such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation and deferred income taxes and a net decrease of million in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
capital expenditures  which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities and available cash balances  were million in  compared to million in and million in capital expenditures in all three years primarily include the cost of lab and testing equipment to support sustaining engineering and new product development efforts 
at december   our long term investments had a fair value of million and consisted of ars whose underlying assets are primarily student loans originated under the federal family education loan program ffelp 
ffelp student loans are guaranteed by state guarantors who have reinsurance agreements with the us department of education 
these ars were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate approximately every days and allows investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such investments at par 
the underlying maturities of these investments range from to years 
as a result of negative conditions in the global credit markets  since february  the majority of the auctions for our investment in these securities have failed to settle  causing us to hold such securities 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
to this end  in november  we executed the put agreement and expect to liquidate all of our remaining ars at par during the latter half of we do not expect to incur any loss of principal  however  until we liquidate our ars  we will recognize any changes in fair value of the ars or put agreement in earnings 
we expect the value of the put agreement and subsequent changes in the value of the put agreement will largely offset the other than temporary impairment on the ars and subsequent fair value movements of the ars  subject to the continued performance by the financial institution of its obligations under the agreement 
during  we generated million from the sale of marketable securities  million in cash from operating activities  received million from the issuance of stock and generated million from the proceeds of asset sales 
further  we used million in the purchase of marketable securities  million in the purchase of property and equipment and million to repay senior borrowings and capital lease obligations 
all of the above activity resulted in a million increase in available cash including the favorable effects of international currency exchange rates on cash of million 
during  we generated million from operating activities  million from the issuance of stock  million in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and million from the sale of assets 
further  we used million for the purchase of marketable securities  million for the purchase of property and equipment and million for the repayment of senior borrowings and capital lease obligations 
all of the above activity resulted in a million increase in available cash including the favorable effects of international currency exchange rates on cash of million 
our working capital decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily due to decreases in cash and marketable securities of million as a result of the reclassification of auction rate securities to long term investments and the stock repurchase program 
on july   our million secured revolving line of credit expired and was not renewed 

table of contents at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including our auction rate securities 
we believe that our current cash levels and cash flows from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs  funding of potential acquisitions  anticipated levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined under item a of regulation s k 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our future payments due under contractual obligations as of december  less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total as of december   we have million in uncertain tax positions  net of federal benefit 
because of the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments  these liabilities are not reflected in the contractual obligations table 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
specifically  these policies have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and provide a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the following are critical accounting estimates warranty costs we offer warranty coverage for a majority our products for periods typically ranging from to months after shipment 
we warrant our solar inverter for five years  and we offer extended warranties for up to an additional five years 
we estimate the anticipated costs of repairing products under warranty based on the historical or expected cost of the repairs and expected failure rates 
the assumptions used to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated quarterly  at a minimum  in light of actual experience and  when appropriate  the accruals or the accrual percentage is adjusted based on specific estimates of project repair 
table of contents costs and quantity of product returns 
our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is based on estimates of the percentage of units affected and the repair costs 
estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale of the related product  and are recorded within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves are provided for excess and obsolete inventory  which are estimated based on a comparison of the quantity of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand 
customer demand is dependent on many factors  including both micro and macroeconomic  and requires us to use significant judgment in our forecasting process 
we must also make assumptions regarding the rate at which new products will be accepted in the marketplace  the rate at which customers will transition from older products to newer products  effect of engineering changes to a product or discontinuance of a product line 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional valuation adjustments may be necessary 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of the weakening global economy  current market conditions and changing customer demand  we reviewed our end of life product and inventory strategies and our excess and obsolete inventory reserve policies 
we determined that the uncertain market conditions negatively affected our longer term demand on our parts and components on hand 
this change in estimate resulted in an approximate million increase to our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  therefore increasing cost of goods sold and decreasing gross profit 
we will continue to evaluate the estimates related to our excess and obsolete inventory reserve 
if market conditions and customer demand continue to weaken in future periods  we may determine that increases in our reserve and  therefore  further increases in cost of goods sold and decreases in gross profit may be necessary 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill is not amortized 
we use a two step approach to assess our goodwill annually  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
we have elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment testing as required under fas on october of each fiscal year 
in step of the assessment we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if an impairment of goodwill is indicated 
if no impairment is indicated in step no additional analysis is performed 
should an impairment be indicated we would determine any loss in step by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill 
we have estimated fair value in step based on our market capitalization 
as of october  and december   our market capitalization exceeded the fair value of our reporting unit 
as such we have concluded no impairment of goodwill existed at either date 
we experienced a cyclical slowdown in demand during fiscal that has continued into the first quarter of as a result  as of february   our market capitalization was below our carrying value and goodwill may be impaired 
we expect to proceed with step of the goodwill impairment analysis during the first quarter of  which may result in an impairment charge of up to million in fair value of auction rate securities we value or financial assets and liabilities using the methods of fair value measurement as described in sfas no 
as defined in sfas no 
 fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements  sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels  which are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to level inputs 
level observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets  but corroborated by direct or indirect market data 
level unobservable inputs  developed using the company s estimates and assumptions  which reflect those that market participants would use 
such inputs are used when little or no market data is available 
the fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to level inputs 
the fair value of our ars and put agreement were determined using level inputs 
some of the inputs into the discounted cash flow models we use are unobservable in the market and have a significant effect on valuation 
the assumptions used in preparing the models include  but are not limited to  periodic coupon rates  market required rates of return and the expected term of each security 
the coupon rate was estimated using implied forward rate data on interest rate swaps and us treasuries  and limited where necessary by any contractual maximum rate paid under a scenario of continuing auction failures 
we believe implied forward rates inherently account for a lack of liquidity 
in making assumptions of the required rates of return  we considered risk free interest rates and credit spreads for investments of similar credit quality 
the expected term for the ars was based on a weighted probability based estimate of the time the principal will become available to us 
the expected term for the put agreement was based on the earliest date on which we can exercise our put 
the principal can become available under three different scenarios the ars is called  the market has returned to normal and auctions have recommenced and are successful  and the principal has reached maturity 
income taxes we assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
our assessment includes a number of factors  including historical results and income projections for each jurisdiction 
at december   the company has gross deferred income tax assets of million in the united states  a significant portion of which relates to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  for which a valuation allowance of million has been provided 
the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income in appropriate jurisdictions during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in determining the amount of the valuation allowance 
based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible  management determines if it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
as of december   the most significant factors considered in determining the realizability of these deferred tax assets was our profitability over the past three years  the historical cyclicality of the markets in which we operate and our projected profitability during these cycles 
the company needs to generate approximately million in pre tax income in the united states prior to the expiration of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to fully utilize these net deferred tax assets 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin as of january  fin requires use of a benefit recognition model with a two step approach i a more likely than not recognition criterion and ii a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
if it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits  no benefit is recorded 
we recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a portion of our income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents stock based compensation we apply the provisions of sfas no 
r to account for its stock plans and employee stock purchase plan  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation in the statement of income 
the fair value of stock options and purchase rights pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected life of the award and expected stock price volatility 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based upon our closing stock price on the grant date 
the fair value of stock based awards expected to vest is amortized over the requisite service period  typically the vesting period  of the award on a straight line basis 
commitments and contingencies from time to time we are involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the normal course of our business 
while we currently believe that the amount of any ultimate loss would not be material to our financial position  the outcome of these actions is inherently difficult to predict 
in the event of an adverse outcome  the ultimate loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or reported results of operations in a particular quarter 
an unfavorable decision  particularly in patent litigation  could require material changes in production processes and products or result in our inability to ship products or components found to have violated third party patent rights

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of december   our investments consisted primarily of commercial paper  municipal bonds  auction rate securities and notes and institutional money markets 
as a measurement of the sensitivity of our portfolio  if interest rates were to fluctuate by basis points  the impact on total yield would be approximately million 
auction rate securities risk we face market risk exposure associated with our investments in auction rate securities 
our investments in auction rate securities ars were classified as available for sale securities and recorded at fair value of million at december  the underlying securities related to these investments were student loans  which accounted for of the recorded fair value  and other municipal holdings  which accounted for the remaining million of the recorded fair value 
these ars are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate approximately every days and allows investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such investments at par 
as a result of current negative conditions in the global credit markets  since february  the large majority of the auctions for our investment in these securities have failed to settle  causing us to continue to hold the securities 
based on the estimated fair value of the ars  during  we recorded an unrealized loss on these securities of approximately million  reflecting the decline in the estimated fair value of these securities 
we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider its impact  if any  on the fair value of these investments 
if current market conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses 
in november  we executed a non transferrable auction rate securities rights agreement the put agreement with a financial institution that provides us with the ability to sell certain of our ars to the financial institution  at our sole discretion  and obligates the financial institution to purchase such ars  at par during the period june  through july  the put agreement had a fair value of million at december  the benefits of the put agreement are subject to the continued performance by the financial institution of its obligations under the agreement
