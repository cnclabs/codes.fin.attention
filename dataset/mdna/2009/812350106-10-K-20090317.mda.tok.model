table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have divided our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a into the following six sections overview of holdings results of operations fiscal year holdings consolidated results business segment results analysis of consolidated financial condition contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements application of critical accounting policies and estimates cautionary statement regarding forward looking information the discussion that follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item overview of holdings holdings is the parent company of kmart and sears 
we are a broadline retailer and  at the end of fiscal  had  kmart and domestic full line stores and  specialty retail stores in the united states operating through kmart and sears and full line and specialty retail stores in canada operating through sears canada  a owned subsidiary 
we currently conduct our operations in three business segments kmart  sears domestic and sears canada 
the nature of operations conducted within each of these segments is discussed within the business segments section of item in this report on form k 
our business segments have been determined in accordance with sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the retail industry is highly competitive and as such  holdings faces significant challenges including the current macroeconomic environment  as many of our product categories are impacted by the housing market and availability of credit to our customers 
however  we believe that we possess unique resources that differentiate us from our competitors 
these resources include the brands we own kenmore  craftsman  diehard  and lands end are one of our most important resources 
we believe that each of these four brands has significant recognition and value with customers 
home services  including installation  delivery  and repair  represent another important resource of our company 
our extensive network of in home and in store service businesses supports our broad line stores and gives us the opportunity to retain long term relationships with our customers a chance to deliver value not only at the point of sale but also on an ongoing basis  and a chance to learn continuously about our customers and what they like and do not like about our products 
our existing store base is another resource  as our more than  domestic stores provide us with a physical presence in all major communities in the united states 
we also have viable online businesses  which enhance our multi channel customer experience 
sears 
com  landsend 
com and partsdirect 
com are examples of online channels where we engage and transact with our customers 
we continue to invest in these online capabilities  as we believe that a compelling multi channel experience will be an important factor for success in the years and decades to come 

table of contents in addition to these resources  we believe that we have a solid balance sheet  as we own substantial inventory and real estate assets and have only billion of debt billion with capital leases 
results of operations fiscal year our fiscal year end is the saturday closest to january st 
in fiscal  the saturday closest to january st was february  and  as a result  fiscal consisted of weeks 
both fiscal and fiscal consisted of weeks 
unless otherwise stated  references to years in this report relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years 
the following fiscal periods are presented in this report 
fiscal year ended weeks january  february  february  prior to fiscal  sears canada s fiscal year end was the saturday closest to december st and therefore we consolidated sears canada s results on a one month lag 
during the fourth quarter of  sears canada changed its fiscal year end from the saturday nearest december st to the saturday nearest january st 
the change in sears canada s year end was considered a preferable change in accounting principle as it allows a full seasonal cycle  including the liquidation of holiday merchandise  for sears canada to be included in the results of holdings 
furthermore  sears canada s fiscal year end is now aligned with the fiscal year end of holdings and its results are no longer accounted for on a one month lag 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and sfas no 
 this change has been retrospectively applied to all prior year amounts included in the financial statements of sears canada for fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further explanation of this change

references to comparable store sales amounts within the following discussion include sales for all stores operating for a period of at least full months  including remodeled and expanded stores  but excluding store relocations and stores that have undergone format changes 
comparable store sales results for fiscal were calculated based on the week period ended january  as compared to the comparable week period in the prior year 
fiscal compared to fiscal net income for the fiscal year ended january   net income was million  or per diluted share compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended february  fiscal results include charges of million million after tax and minority interest or per 
table of contents diluted share related to goodwill and asset impairments  store closings and severance  of which million million after tax or per diluted share relates to non cash items 
these charges were partially offset by mark to market gains on sears canada hedge transactions of million million after tax and minority interest or per diluted share  the positive impact of the reversal of a million million after tax or per diluted share reserve because of the overturning of an adverse jury verdict relating to the redemption of certain sears  roebuck and co 
bonds in  a tax benefit of million per diluted share related to the resolution of certain income tax matters  and gains on negotiated repurchases of debt securities prior to maturity of million million after tax or per diluted share 
excluding the significant items above  net income was million  or per diluted share  for the full year in fiscal net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share 
fiscal results include the impact of a gain of million million after tax or per diluted share for insurance recoveries received on hurricane claims filed for certain of our property damaged by hurricanes during fiscal and a curtailment gain of million million after tax or per diluted share related to certain amendments made to sears canada s post retirement benefit plans 
these gains were partially offset by losses of million million after tax or per diluted share on our total return swap investments 
excluding the significant items above  net income was million  or per diluted share  in fiscal excluding the items noted above  net income decreased million during fiscal the decrease in net income for the year reflects a decrease in operating income of billion or million excluding the impact of certain items noted above  primarily due to lower operating income at kmart and sears domestic  as well as slightly lower operating income at sears canada 
the decrease in net income was also due to lower interest and investment income  partially offset by lower income tax expense 
declines in the operating results of sears domestic and kmart are primarily the result of a decline in gross margin across most major merchandise categories  reflecting both sales declines as well as an overall decline in our gross margin rate for the year due to increased markdowns taken across most merchandise categories and reduced leverage of buying and occupancy costs 
during  we made a concerted effort to reduce our inventory levels due to the deterioration of the economic climate in the latter half of and what we anticipated to be a higher risk environment in total revenues and comparable store sales total revenues for fiscal were billion  as compared to revenues of billion for fiscal the decline in revenues of billion is primarily due to a billion decline at sears domestic  a billion decline at kmart  and a million decline at sears canada  which includes a decrease of million related to the impact of exchange rates during fiscal exchange rates did not have as significant an impact on the results of sears canada in as compared to  as rates were less volatile during the current year 
the decrease in fiscal revenues as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the impact of lower comparable store sales at kmart and sears domestic 
fiscal domestic comparable store sales were down in the aggregate  with sears domestic declining and kmart declining 
in fiscal  declines were experienced across most major merchandise categories 
domestic comparable store sales declines continue to be driven by categories most directly impacted by housing market conditions including a high single digit percentage decline in home appliances at sears domestic and a slowdown in consumers discretionary spending including a high single digit percentage decline in home goods  a mid single digit percentage decline in apparel at kmart  high single digit percentage declines in home and household goods at sears domestic  and a low double digit percentage decline in apparel  tools  and lawn and garden at sears domestic 
if the overall retail environment continues to be impacted by unfavorable economic factors  our sales will likely continue to be pressured in fiscal 
table of contents gross margin gross margin declined from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal the decline of billion was mainly attributable to lower gross margin dollars generated at both kmart and sears domestic as a result of the above noted sales declines  as well as a decline in the gross margin rate 
gross margin also includes a charge of million for markdowns recorded in connection with store closings announced during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal gross margin as a percentage of merchandise sales and services revenue gross margin rate was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the basis point decline consisted of a basis point decline at sears domestic and a basis point decline at kmart  partially offset by an increase of basis points at sears canada 
our buying and occupancy costs are relatively fixed in nature  and therefore did not decrease as much as sales decreased during reduced leverage of buying and occupancy costs  given lower overall sales levels in fiscal  accounted for approximately basis points of the total decline in our gross margin rate in fiscal the remaining basis point decline was primarily the result of a decline in gross margin rate at sears domestic  which declined mainly due to increased markdown activity across most merchandise categories 
the impact of increased markdowns on sears domestic throughout the year was somewhat mitigated by fewer markdowns taken in the seasonal and winter apparel category during the fourth quarter of fiscal as our purchases of merchandise were more consistent with the sales trends 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal fiscal selling and administrative expenses include a million charge related to store closing and severance reserves and the positive impact of the reversal of a million reserve because of the overturning of an adverse jury verdict relating to the redemption of certain sears  roebuck and co 
bonds in fiscal selling and administrative expenses include a million curtailment gain recorded in connection with changes made to sears canada s benefit plans and a million gain related to insurance recoveries for certain sears domestic properties damaged by hurricanes during fiscal excluding the impact of these items  selling and administrative expenses decreased million during fiscal mainly due to a million reduction in payroll and benefits expense  as well as a million reduction in advertising expense 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues selling and administrative expense rate were in fiscal  as compared to for fiscal while total selling and administrative expenses were reduced in fiscal  the current year selling and administrative expense rate increased  primarily reflecting lower expense leverage resulting from lower overall sales levels 
throughout we took a number of actions to decrease our expenses and in the fourth quarter of we announced that we were suspending the company contribution to the k plan in fiscal year we plan to pursue additional expense reductions in fiscal depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased by million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to additional property and equipment becoming fully depreciated during the year  thereby decreasing our depreciable asset base 
impairment charges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we performed an impairment test of certain of our long lived assets principally the value of buildings and other 
table of contents fixed assets associated with our stores due to events and changes in circumstances during the third quarter of that indicated an impairment might have occurred 
the impairment review was triggered by the increased severity of the economic turmoil and weakening in the us economy during the third quarter  which had a negative impact on the performance of our stores 
as a result of this review  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the third quarter of fiscal this impairment charge includes a charge for the stores that we decided to close in the third quarter and early fourth quarter of fiscal we also recorded a million impairment charge related to the property and equipment at stores we decided to close in january during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets pursuant to sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of our tests  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the fair value of goodwill associated with our orchard supply hardware osh subsidiary 
sfas no 
requires interim tests for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets be performed should indicators of such an impairment arise as a result of changes in existing business conditions 
we did not perform an interim test of goodwill during fiscal as we did not have any indicators of potential impairment prior to the fourth quarter 
see notes and in notes to consolidated financial statements  as well as the discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates below  for further information on the million of impairment charges we recorded during fiscal operating income we reported operating income of million in fiscal  as compared to operating income of billion for fiscal excluding the effects of one time charges discussed above  operating income declined million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  mainly due to lower gross margin dollars  partially offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expense  as well as lower depreciation and amortization expense 
interest and investment income we earned million in interest and investment income in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal interest and investment income for fiscal is mainly comprised of a dividend of million from our investment in sears mexico and interest income of million 
interest and investment income for fiscal was mainly comprised of a dividend of million from sears mexico and interest income of million  partially offset by investment losses of million on total return swaps outstanding during the fiscal year ended february  there were no total return swaps outstanding during the fiscal year 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal is primarily due to lower overall cash and cash equivalent balances maintained during the first three quarters of fiscal as compared to the same period in fiscal interest expense we incurred million in interest expense during fiscal  as compared to million last year 
the reduction in interest expense is mainly the result of a reduction in long term borrowings and lower short term interest rates  partially offset by an increase in the amount of short term borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
other income other income in fiscal is primarily comprised of mark to market gains on sears canada hedge transactions 
total net gains of million were recorded on these transactions in fiscal other income also includes gains on negotiated repurchases of debt securities prior to their maturity and bankruptcy related recoveries 
we recorded million in gains related to the repurchases of debt securities in fiscal we had 
table of contents no comparable gains in fiscal we recorded million of bankruptcy related recoveries during fiscal as compared to million of such recoveries in fiscal bankruptcy related recoveries represent amounts collected from vendors who had received cash payment for pre petition obligations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on bankruptcy claims resolution and settlements 
income taxes our effective tax rate in fiscal was as compared to in fiscal the increase in our tax rate is primarily due to the fact that a portion of our impairment charge for goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes 
income tax expense in also includes a benefit of million related to the resolution of certain tax matters 
fiscal compared to fiscal net income net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share 
fiscal results include the impact of a gain of million million after tax or per diluted share for insurance recoveries received on hurricane claims filed for certain of our property damaged by hurricanes during fiscal and a curtailment gain of million million after tax or per diluted share related to certain amendments made to sears canada s post retirement benefit plans 
these gains were partially offset by losses of million million after tax or per diluted share on our total return swap investments 
excluding significant items  net income was million  or per diluted share  in fiscal net income for fiscal was billion  or per diluted share 
fiscal results include the impact of a million million after tax or per diluted share gain derived from our investments in total return swaps  million million after tax or per diluted share related to the june settlement of visa mastercard antitrust litigation  a tax benefit of million per diluted share related to the resolution of certain income tax matters  restructuring charges of million million after tax or 
per diluted share  a million gain million after tax or per diluted share on the sale of kmart s former headquarters building  and a charge of million million after tax or per diluted share related to an unfavorable verdict in connection with a pre merger legal matter concerning sears roebuck s redemption of certain bonds in excluding significant items  net income was billion  or per diluted share  in fiscal the decrease in net income in fiscal reflects lower operating results at both sears domestic and kmart  partially offset by improved operating results at sears canada 
declines in the operating results of sears domestic and kmart are primarily the result of a decline in gross margin across most major merchandise categories  reflecting both sales declines  as well as an overall decline in our gross margin rate for the year 
we made a strategic decision in to begin fiscal with more inventory than we held in the past in order to meet higher anticipated customer demand  based on the projected performance of several of our businesses 
the higher inventory investment coupled with the difficult economic environment led to a significant increase in markdowns to clear product  especially seasonal product that has a shorter life than basic items 
this affected gross margin in two ways  both lower volume due to declining sales a billion sales decline over the prior year and a lower gross margin rate due to the increased markdowns in fiscal compared to in fiscal 
interest and investment income also declined during the year as we settled our investments in total return swaps during the third quarter 
the negative impact of these declines on our fiscal results was only partially offset by declines in selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  income tax expense given lower levels of pre tax income in fiscal  and reduced interest expense given lower average outstanding borrowings 

table of contents total revenues and comparable store sales fiscal revenues were billion as compared to billion in fiscal the decrease in fiscal revenues  as compared to reported revenues for fiscal  was primarily due to the impact of lower domestic comparable store sales  and to a lesser degree  the inclusion of an additional week of sales in fiscal comprised of weeks as compared to fiscal comprised of weeks 
we recorded a total of million in revenues during the rd week of fiscal these declines were partially offset by sales increases at sears canada of million  including an increase of million related to the impact of favorable exchange rates  as the canadian dollar strengthened in fiscal fiscal domestic comparable store sales were down in the aggregate  with sears domestic declining and kmart declining 
declines were experienced across most major merchandise categories in fiscal reflecting increased competition  the impact of a deteriorating housing market  the increased costs of consumer staples and a decrease in consumers disposable income 
in fiscal  notably larger declines within the home appliance and apparel categories were partially offset by increased sales of consumer electronics 
the increase in sales of consumer electronics reflected increased consumer demand and our ability to improve market share in this category in which the prices of products increasingly became more commodity based during gross margin the gross margin rate was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal gross margin rate declines at kmart and sears domestic were partially offset by an increase in the rate at sears canada 
the basis point decline consisted of margin declines at both kmart and sears domestic  offset by an increase at sears canada of million  which includes an increase of million related to the impact of favorable exchange rates 
our gross margin rate decreased across most domestic merchandise categories during fiscal primarily due to increased markdown activity  partially offset by increases in initial markons as a result of improved direct sourcing  contract negotiations and pricing efforts 
increased markdowns were taken throughout the year to clear excess levels of inventory  most notably within categories which are more seasonal in nature such as apparel and lawn and garden 
increased markdowns in seasonal apparel categories also resulted from the unfavorable impact of unseasonably warm weather prevalent during much of the fall in fiscal as a result we had a mid single digit decline in sales related to fall apparel at kmart  a low double digit decline in sales related to spring and fall apparel at sears domestic and a double digit increase in markdowns at sears domestic 
as noted previously  we experienced increased sales of consumer electronics during the year  however  these products have lower average margins which negatively impacted the overall margin rate of holdings for fiscal additionally  reduced leverage of buying and occupancy costs contributed basis points to the total decline in margin of basis points during the year 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal fiscal selling and administrative expenses include a million curtailment gain recorded in connection with changes made to sears canada s benefit plans and a million gain related to insurance recoveries for certain sears domestic properties damaged by hurricanes during fiscal fiscal selling and administrative expenses include a gain of million related to the june settlement of visa mastercard antitrust litigation and a charge of million related to an unfavorable verdict in connection with a pre merger legal matter concerning sears roebuck s redemption of certain bonds in excluding the impact of these items  selling and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the reduction in selling and administrative expenses was mainly the result of a reduction in payroll and benefits expense  including lower performance based compensation 
the current year selling and administrative 
table of contents expense rate increased  primarily reflecting lower expense leverage resulting from lower overall sales levels 
the reduction in payroll and benefits expense was offset by increases in a number of other categories  most notably in selling and administrative expenses at canada  which include an increase of million related to the impact of currency exchange rates 
the selling and administrative expense rate was in fiscal  as compared to for fiscal while total selling and administrative expenses declined million in fiscal  the current year selling and administrative rate increased  primarily reflecting lower expense leverage resulting from lower overall sales levels 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was billion for fiscal  as compared to billion for fiscal the decreased expense for fiscal is primarily attributable to additional property and equipment becoming fully depreciated during the year  thereby decreasing our depreciable asset base 
gains on sales of assets gains on sales of assets were million in fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal the fiscal gain was primarily attributable to a million pre tax gain recognized in connection with the sale of our former kmart headquarters in troy  michigan 
restructuring charges restructuring charges were million for fiscal these charges included million for employee related termination costs associated with sears canada s restructuring initiatives implemented during fiscal  including a workforce reduction of approximately  associates  as well as million at kmart for relocation assistance and employee termination related costs associated with holdings home office integration efforts 
we did not incur any restructuring costs during fiscal interest and investment income interest and investment income was million in fiscal  as compared with million in fiscal as discussed above  the decreased interest and investment income in fiscal was primarily due to performance of investments in total return swaps losses of million recognized in the current year as compared to total return swap income of million recognized in fiscal and less interest earned on our cash balances  partially offset by a million dividend received from our investment in sears mexico 
interest expense we incurred million in interest expense during fiscal  as compared to million in the reduction in interest expense is attributable to lower average outstanding borrowings during fiscal other income other income is primarily comprised of bankruptcy related recoveries in the amount of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
bankruptcy related recoveries increased million in fiscal and represent amounts recovered from vendors who had received cash payment for pre petition obligations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
other income in fiscal also included income recorded relative to foreign currency forward contracts for which hedge accounting was not applied

table of contents business segment results kmart kmart results and key statistics were as follows millions  except for number of stores merchandise sales and services cost of sales  buying and occupancy gross margin dollars gross margin rate selling and administrative selling and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues depreciation and amortization impairment charges gain on sales of assets restructuring charges total costs and expenses operating income total kmart stores fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues and comparable store sales comparable store sales and total sales decreased and  respectively  during fiscal the decline in kmart comparable store sales during fiscal compares to a decline in comparable store sales recorded for fiscal comparable store sales declines were driven by mid to high single digit declines recorded within the apparel and home categories 
we believe the overall decline in comparable store sales reflects the negative impact of certain external economic factors  as noted above in the discussion of holdings consolidated results 
gross margin kmart generated billion in total gross margin in fiscal  as compared to billion in fiscal the million decline includes a charge of million recorded to markdown inventory in connection with store closings announced during the third and fourth quarters of and primarily reflects the negative gross margin impact of lower overall sales  as well as a decline in kmart s gross margin rate 
kmart s gross margin rate was  as compared to in fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease in kmart s gross margin rate is due to an increase of in buying and occupancy costs which are more fixed in nature as a percentage of sales  offset by an increase in margin related to lower royalties paid on select merchandise 
selling and administrative expenses fiscal selling and administrative expenses decreased million as compared to fiscal the decline in selling and administrative expenses mainly reflects a million reduction in payroll expenses as well as a million reduction in advertising costs 
these reductions were partially offset by expenses incurred for certain store closing and severance costs of million 
our selling and administrative expense rate was for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal  and increased primarily as a result of lower expense leverage given lower overall sales 

table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in fiscal as compared to the same period in fiscal the increase in expense is due to the addition of property and equipment in the kmart segment during the year 
impairment charges kmart recorded an impairment charge of million during the third quarter of fiscal in connection with impairment testing performed under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we recorded an additional impairment of million during the fourth quarter of related to our decision to close additional kmart stores in january see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding impairment charges 
operating income operating income was million in fiscal year  as compared to operating income of million in fiscal  a decline of million 
as discussed above  declines primarily reflect the negative gross margin impact of lower sales levels  as well as a slight decline in kmart s gross margin rate in in addition to the above noted decline in gross margin  the decline in operating income reflects  to a lesser degree  the impact of million of charges recorded in connection with store closings  severance and fixed asset impairments in fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues and comparable store sales comparable store sales and total sales decreased and  respectively  during fiscal total sales for the weeks in fiscal decreased  or billion  compared to the weeks in fiscal  mainly due to the macroeconomic factors discussed previously 
the decrease includes a decline related to the impact of sales recorded during the rd week of fiscal year in the amount of million 
the remaining decline in sales in fiscal was due to lower comparable store sales 
the decline in kmart comparable store sales during fiscal compares to a decline in comparable store sales recorded for fiscal the decline in comparable store sales during fiscal was recorded across most categories  with more pronounced declines within the lawn and garden  home appliance  apparel  drug store and general merchandise categories 
sales within lawn and garden  as well as home appliances  were weaker throughout fiscal  reflecting the impact of a weakening residential construction and housing market 
apparel and general merchandise was affected by the decline in general economic conditions  which affected sales of basic wear  including jeans  t shirts and other everyday items 
the decline in apparel sales in also reflects the impact of weather on sales of our seasonal apparel  which resulted in a mid single digit decline in sales related to fall apparel 
drug store sales were impacted by increased competition 
gross margin kmart generated billion in total gross margin in fiscal  as compared to billion in fiscal  with the billion decline reflecting the negative gross margin impact of lower overall sales  as well as a decline in kmart s gross margin rate 
for fiscal  kmart s gross margin rate was as compared to for fiscal  a decline of 
reduced leverage of buying and occupancy costs  given lower overall sales levels  accounted for approximately of the total decline  with the remaining decline attributable to gross margin rate declines across a number of merchandise categories  most notably in the apparel and home categories 
increased markdowns had a negative impact on our margins in these categories as we made efforts to clear excess seasonal apparel  lawn and garden and other home product inventory affected by the slowdown in the housing market 

table of contents selling and administrative expenses for fiscal  kmart s selling and administrative expense rate was  as compared to for fiscal fiscal selling and administrative expenses included a million gain  representing kmart s portion of the settlement in the visa mastercard antitrust litigation 
excluding this gain  kmart s selling and administrative expense rate was for fiscal while total selling and administrative expenses declined million in fiscal  the current year selling and administrative rate increased  reflecting lower expense leverage against sales for the year 
the reduction in selling and administrative expenses was due mainly to a reduction in payroll and benefits expense  including lower performance based compensation 
the reduction in payroll and benefits expense was offset by small increases in a number of other categories 
gains on sales of assets kmart recorded million and million in gains on sales of assets during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
gains recorded on sales of assets in fiscal included a million gain recognized in connection with our sale of kmart s former corporate headquarters in troy  michigan 
restructuring charges kmart recorded restructuring charges of million during fiscal the charges were for relocation assistance and employee termination related costs incurred in connection with holdings home office integration efforts initiated in fiscal no such charges were recorded in fiscal operating income operating income was million in fiscal year  as compared to operating income of million in fiscal  a decline of million 
as discussed above  declines primarily reflect the negative gross margin impact of lower sales levels  as well as a decline in kmart s gross margin rate in as a result of markdowns taken to clear excess levels of inventory 
in addition to the above noted decline in gross margin  the decline reflects  to a lesser degree  the impact of higher depreciation and amortization expense  and lower gains on sales of assets in fiscal  partially offset by the favorable impact of lower selling and administrative expenses and a decrease in restructuring costs

comparable store sales declines were driven by high single digit percentage declines recorded in the home appliances and household goods categories and low double digit percentage declines recorded in the apparel  tools and lawn and garden categories 
gross margin for fiscal  sears domestic generated billion in total gross margin  as compared to billion in fiscal  a decline of billion 
the decline includes a million charge taken to markdown inventory in connection with store closings and primarily reflects the negative margin impact of lower overall sales levels  as well as a decline in sears domestic s gross margin rate for the quarter 
sears domestic s gross margin rate was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal  a decline of basis points 
reduced leverage of buying and occupancy costs  given lower overall sales levels  accounted for approximately basis points of the total decline  with the remaining basis point decline attributable to gross margin rate declines across a number of merchandise categories  most notably home appliances and apparel 
while we tightly managed inventory levels all year  with the goal of reducing inventory to below last year s levels  the economic environment resulted in increased markdowns  which is the primary reason for the remaining basis point decline in sears domestic s gross margin rate 
gross margin rate decreases in the apparel category are mainly the result of markdowns taken to clear seasonal merchandise 
the decline in gross margin rate for sears domestic was not as great during the fourth quarter of fiscal as purchases of seasonal and winter apparel became more consistent with current sales trends 

table of contents selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses declined million during fiscal and includes a million charge related to store closing and severance reserves  the positive impact of the reversal of a million reserve because of a favorable verdict in connection with a pre merger legal matter concerning sears redemption of certain bonds in  as well as insurance proceeds of million related to a sears  roebuck and co 
matter from march selling and administrative expenses for fiscal include a gain of million for insurance recoveries received on claims filed for certain property damaged by hurricanes during fiscal excluding these items  selling and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal as compared to the same period in fiscal the reduction in selling and administrative expenses is due to a reduction in payroll expenses of million  as well as a decrease in advertising costs of million

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased by million during fiscal as compared to the same period in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is primarily attributable to additional property and equipment becoming fully depreciated during the year  thereby decreasing our depreciable asset base 
impairment charges sears domestic recorded an impairment charge of million during the third quarter of fiscal in connection with impairment testing performed under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we recorded an additional impairment of million during the fourth quarter of related to our decision to close additional sears domestic stores in january see notes and in notes to consolidated financial statements  as well as the discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates below  for further information regarding impairment charges 
we performed our annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process as described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note below 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
as a result of impairment analysis  we determined that the entire amount of goodwill recorded at sears domestic s subsidiary  osh  was impaired and recorded a charge of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding impairment charges 
operating income loss sears domestic recorded an operating loss of million in fiscal  as compared to operating income of million in fiscal  a decline of billion 
excluding the above noted significant items  operating income declined million and primarily reflects lower total gross margin dollars generated as a result of lower overall sales levels and a decline in gross margin rate  partially offset by a reduction in selling and administrative expenses 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues and comparable store sales merchandise sales and services revenues declined billion  or  to billion for fiscal  as compared to total revenues of billion for fiscal total fiscal revenues benefited from million in sales recorded during the rd week of the fiscal year 
excluding the impact of the rd week on sales in fiscal  total revenues declined billion in fiscal  with the decline primarily reflecting an aggregate decrease in comparable store sales 
the decline in comparable store sales during fiscal was due to declines across most categories and formats  with more pronounced declines in the home appliance  lawn and garden  tools and apparel categories  partially offset by increases within home electronics 
we believe the sales increase in home electronics reflected our gain in market share in this category  as well as increased market demand for flat panel televisions in sales within the home appliance  lawn and garden and tools categories were weaker throughout fiscal  reflecting the impact of a weakening residential construction and housing market  as well as decreased sales of weather driven products  such as air conditioners  due to cooler than normal temperatures in the first half of the year 
with regard to apparel  we believe the decline in sales in reflects both the impact of cooler temperatures in the spring and unseasonably warm weather during the fall on sales of our seasonal apparel 
as a result we had a low double digit decline in sales related to spring and fall apparel and double digit increase in markdowns 
we believe apparel was also affected by the decline in general economic conditions  which affected sales of basic wear  including jeans  t shirts and other everyday items 
gross margin for fiscal  sears domestic generated billion in total gross margin  as compared to billion in fiscal  with the billion decline primarily reflecting the negative margin impact of lower overall sales levels  as well as a decline in sears domestic s gross margin rate for the year 
sears domestic s gross margin rate was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal  a decline of as a percentage of total revenues 
reduced leverage of buying and occupancy costs  given lower overall sales levels  accounted for approximately of the total decline  with the remaining decline attributable to gross margin rate declines across a number of merchandise categories  most notably in the apparel and home categories 
increased markdowns had a negative impact on our margins in these categories as we made efforts to clear excess seasonal apparel  as well as appliances and other home improvement product inventory affected by the slowdown in the housing market 
the decline was also attributable to a higher proportion of sales of home electronics  which traditionally have a lower margin rate 
selling and administrative expenses total selling and administrative expenses declined million in fiscal sears domestic s selling and administrative expense for fiscal included the favorable impact of a million gain recorded in connection with settlement of the visa mastercard antitrust litigation  offset by the recognition of a million liability in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with a pre merger legal matter concerning sears roebuck s redemption of certain bonds in excluding these items  the selling and administrative expenses declined million in fiscal the reduction in selling and administrative expenses was due mainly to a reduction in payroll and benefits expense  including lower performance based compensation 
the selling and administrative expense rate was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal consistent with the discussions of holdings expenses above  while selling and administrative expenses declined  the increase in the rate primarily reflects lower expense leverage against sales for this fiscal year 

table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal is primarily attributable to additional property and equipment becoming fully depreciated during the year  thereby decreasing our depreciable asset base 
operating income for fiscal  sears domestic s operating income decreased million to million  as compared to billion in fiscal the decrease primarily reflects lower total gross margin dollars generated as a result of lower overall sales levels and a decline in gross margin rate as a result of markdowns taken to clear excess levels of inventory 
the impact of these items was offset by million decline in depreciation and amortization expense 
sears canada sears canada  a consolidated  owned subsidiary of sears  conducts similar retail operations as sears domestic

table of contents analysis of consolidated financial condition cash balances cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase 
our cash and cash equivalents balances as of the fiscal years ended january  and february  are detailed in the following table 
millions january  february  domestic cash and equivalents cash posted as collateral credit card deposits in transit total domestic cash and cash equivalents sears canada total cash and cash equivalents restricted cash total cash balances we had total cash balances of billion at january  as compared to billion at february  the decline in cash and cash equivalents from february  primarily reflects a decrease in net operating cash flows generated during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to lower income and increased cash uses for merchandise payables and other operating liabilities  partially offset by an increase in cash generated from inventory 
significant uses of cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal year ended january  included the funding of share repurchases of million and capital expenditures of million  as well as million in contributions to our pension and post retirement plans 
our invested cash may include  from time to time  investments in  but not limited to  commercial paper  us federal  state and municipal government securities  floating rate notes  repurchase agreements and money market funds 
cash amounts held in these short term investments are readily available to us and included million and million as of fiscal year end and fiscal year end  respectively  invested in support of our wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
additionally  as explained below  our board of directors has delegated authority to direct investment of surplus cash to edward s 
lampert  subject to various limitations that have been or may be from time to time adopted by the board of directors and or the finance committee of the board of directors 
domestically we have posted cash collateral for certain outstanding letters of credit and self insurance programs 
such cash collateral is classified within cash and cash equivalents as it is readily available to us and we have the ability to substitute letters of credit at any time for this cash collateral 
credit card deposits in transit include deposits in transit from banks for payments related to third party credit card and debit card transactions 
restricted cash consists of cash related to sears canada s cash balances which have been pledged as collateral for letters of credit obligations issued under its offshore merchandise purchasing program and with counterparties related to outstanding derivative contracts  as well as funds held in trust in accordance with regulatory requirements governing advance ticket sales related to sears travel 
our january  cash balance excludes million on deposit with the reserve primary fund  a money market fund which temporarily suspended withdrawals while it liquidates its holdings to generate cash to distribute 
as a result  we reclassified million from cash to the prepaid expenses and other current assets line 
table of contents within our consolidated balance sheet at january  on february  we received a distribution of million of the total million that had been held on deposit with the reserve primary fund at january  we expect to receive our remaining investment during fiscal we classify outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit within other current liabilities and reduce cash balances when these checks clear the bank on which they were drawn 
outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit were million and million for the fiscal year ended and  respectively 
investment of available capital since the merger we have generated significant operating cash flows  and management expects that our cash flows will continue to exceed our annual operating cash needs for the foreseeable future 
we have and will continue to invest in our businesses to improve the customer experience and provide the opportunity for attractive returns 
further  as of january   we have repurchased approximately billion of our common shares since the merger and may continue to repurchase shares subject to market conditions and board authorization 
in addition  we may pursue investments in the form of acquisitions  joint ventures and partnerships where we believe appropriate returns can be obtained 
further  we may determine under certain market conditions that available capital is best utilized to fund investments that we believe offer us attractive return opportunities  whether or not related to our ongoing business activities 
as previously disclosed  our board of directors has delegated authority to direct investment of our surplus cash to our chairman  edward s 
lampert  subject to various limitations that have been or may be from time to time adopted by the board of directors and or finance committee of the board of directors 
during fiscal and we invested a portion of our surplus cash in various securities and financial instruments  including total return swaps  which are derivative instruments that synthetically replicate the economic return characteristics of one or more underlying marketable equity securities 
we had no investments in total return swaps as of january  or february  operating activities and cash flows as a retailer  holdings primary source of operating cash flows is the sales of goods and services to customers  while the primary use of cash in operations is to fund the purchase of merchandise inventories 
holdings generated million in operating cash flows during fiscal  as compared to billion in fiscal the decrease in net operating cash flows generated during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily reflects lower income  partially offset by an increase in cash generated from inventory reductions during the year 
holdings generated approximately billion in operating cash flows during fiscal  as compared to billion in fiscal the increase in net operating cash flows generated during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily reflects a cash inflow of million related to merchandise inventories in versus cash used of million in  offset by an increase in cash used for income and other taxes  as well as decreased net income 
merchandise inventories at january  were billion  as compared to billion as of february  domestic inventory levels declined from billion at february  to billion at january   despite the addition of million of kmart footwear inventory which was added when kmart began operating its footwear department in january kmart s footwear business had previously been operated by a third party 
inventory levels at sears canada decreased million  largely due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
we continue to review and assess our merchandise inventory levels in an ongoing effort to continuously improve overall returns 
as we expect difficult economic conditions to persist in the near term  we intend to continue to tightly manage our inventories throughout fiscal merchandise payables were billion at january   as compared to billion as of february  the decline in merchandise payables is reflective of the overall decline in inventory levels during fiscal 
table of contents investing activities and cash flows net cash flows used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal  as compared to million used in fiscal and million used in fiscal cash used in investing activities in all three years was primarily used for purchases of property and equipment 
during fiscal we spent million on capital expenditures as compared to million during fiscal capital expenditures during fiscal included ongoing investments in the maintenance of the company s facilities including a significant investment in lighting retrofit projects to reduce energy consumption in holdings facilities and in information technology 
capital expenditures during fiscal included multiple real estate acquisitions of space used for holdings retail locations or distribution centers and for continued investments in our information technology 
we used million for capital expenditures in fiscal  and significant projects included the opening of sears essentials grand locations  as well as remodeling approximately kmart locations to include sears brand products  most notably home appliances 
we anticipate fiscal capital expenditure levels to be approximately flat to levels  however  it should be noted that in the normal course of business  we consider opportunities to purchase leased operating properties  as well as offers to sell owned  or assign leased  operating and non operating properties 
these transactions may  individually or in the aggregate  result in material proceeds or outlays of cash and cause our capital expenditure levels to vary from period to period 
in addition  we review leases that will expire in the short term in order to determine the appropriate action to take with respect to them 
during fiscal  we purchased previously leased operating properties for million 
during fiscal we purchased an additional million of sears canada s common shares in open market transactions 
we paid a total of million for the additional shares acquired  which brought our total ownership interest in sears canada to 
fiscal investing activity cash flows also reflect cash paid in connection with the acquisition of additional interest in sears canada 
we paid a total of million for additional common shares of sears canada during  raising holdings ownership in sears canada to approximately as of february  from approximately as of fiscal year end these transactions are further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in the results of operations and investment of available capital sections above  we entered into total return swaps during fiscal and fiscal in connection with the settlement of our investments in total return swaps during  collateral posted in the amount of million in was returned to us in there were no total return swaps outstanding as of january  or february  we purchased million shares of common stock of restoration hardware  inc restoration  a specialty retailer of hardware  bathware  furniture  lighting  textiles  accessories and gifts during our investment of million represented an ownership interest of of restoration s total outstanding shares 
we sold our investment in restoration during the second quarter of fiscal financing activities and cash flows net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal as compared to billion used in and billion used in the difference primarily reflects common share repurchase activity during the three year period 
we repurchased million  billion and million of our common stock pursuant to our common share repurchase program in fiscal  and  respectively 
the common share repurchase program was initially announced in with a total authorization by our board of directors of up to billion 
during the three year period from fiscal through fiscal  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional of common stock  for a total authorization since inception of the program of billion 
at january   we had approximately million of remaining authorization under the program 
the share repurchase program has no stated expiration date and share repurchases may be 
table of contents implemented using a variety of methods  which may include open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  block trades  accelerated share repurchase transactions  the purchase of call options  the sale of put options or otherwise  or by any combination of such methods 
payments on our debt  when netted with new borrowings during  were nominal 
fiscal financing cash flows include debt payments of million  net of new borrowings  as compared to million of net payments in fiscal the difference in cash used to repay debt between and primarily reflects the generation of million of debt proceeds  net of approximately million in issuance costs  in connection with our entering into a five year  million senior secured term loan at our osh subsidiary in december the proceeds of this borrowing were used by osh to pay holdings the remaining loan payable issued in connection with osh s recapitalization in november the senior secured term loan is non recourse to holdings 
debt payments made during were completely offset by increases in short term borrowings  which were made primarily through our revolving credit facility 
in august  sears canada sold its headquarters office building and adjacent land in toronto  ontario for proceeds of million canadian  net of closing costs 
sears canada is currently leasing back the property under a leaseback agreement for a period up to months  and incurring its current level of occupancy costs  until it relocates all head office operations to currently underutilized space in the toronto eaton centre  ontario 
the carrying value of the property was approximately million as of february  given the terms of the leaseback  for accounting purposes  the excess of proceeds received over the carrying value of the associated property has been deferred  and the resulting gain will be recognized at the end of the leaseback period when sears canada is no longer utilizing the associated property 
we expect to recognize this gain during the first half of fiscal uses and sources of liquidity our primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of our retail businesses  capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes  including common share repurchases  debt repayment and pension plan contributions 
we believe that these needs will be adequately funded by our operating cash flows  credit terms received from vendors and borrowings under our billion  five year credit agreement the credit agreement described below 
at january   billion was available under this facility 
while we expect to use the credit agreement as our primary funding source  we may also access the public debt markets on an opportunistic basis 
additionally  we may from time to time consider selective strategic transactions to create value and improve performance  which may include acquisitions  dispositions  restructurings  joint ventures and partnerships 
transactions of these types may result in material proceeds or cash outlays 
our year end fiscal and outstanding borrowings were as follows millions january  february  short term borrowings unsecured commercial paper secured borrowings long term debt  including current portion notes and debentures outstanding capitalized lease obligations total borrowings 
table of contents in fiscal  the finance committee of our board of directors authorized the repurchase  subject to market conditions and other factors  of up to million of our outstanding indebtedness in open market or privately negotiated transactions

our wholly owned finance subsidiary  sears roebuck acceptance corp 
srac  has repurchased million of its outstanding notes  including million repurchased during fiscal and million repurchased during each of fiscal and fiscal  thereby reducing the unused balance of this authorization to million 
we recognized a gain of million on the repurchases made during fiscal certain of our debt is variable rate and we therefore manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed and variable rate funding and interest rate derivatives 
at each of january  and february   we had interest rate derivatives with notional amounts of million and nominal fair values

the credit agreement is guaranteed by holdings and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries and is secured by a first lien on our domestic inventory  credit card accounts receivable and the proceeds thereof 
availability under the credit agreement is determined pursuant to a borrowing base formula  based on domestic inventory levels  subject to certain limitations 
the credit agreement does not contain provisions that would restrict borrowings or letter of credit issuances based on material adverse changes or credit ratings 
we expect to renegotiate and extend our credit facility during fiscal at a capacity more in line with our historical borrowing practices 
as of january   we had million of borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement with billion of availability 
the million in borrowings  borrowed in january  are classified within short term borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  as we expect to repay the entire million of borrowings within the next twelve months 
the majority of the letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement are used to provide collateral for our insurance programs 
our billion credit agreement is funded by a syndicate of financial institutions  including an affiliate of lehman brothers 
this affiliate has a million total commitment in the billion revolving credit facility  but since september  has not funded its proportionate share of our borrowings under the facility 
excluding this portion  our availability under the agreement is billion 
cash collateral we also post cash collateral for certain domestic self insurance programs which we continue to classify as cash and cash equivalents due to our ability to substitute letters of credit for the cash at any time at our discretion

benefit and pension plan obligations contributions to our pension plans remain a significant use of our cash on an annual basis 
while sears holdings pension plan is frozen and thus associates do not currently earn pension benefits  the company has a legacy pension obligation for past service performed by kmart and sears  roebuck and co 
associates 
the annual pension expense included in our financial statements related to these legacy domestic pension plans has been relatively minimal in recent years the expense was million in 
however  due to the severe decline in the capital markets that occurred in the latter part of our domestic pension expense will increase by an estimated to million in we expect to contribute approximately million to our domestic pension plan in fiscal further  as a result of the severe decline in capital markets that occurred in the latter part of  our pension contributions are expected to increase to approximately million in if pension funding reform is not enacted and or the financial markets do not recover 
wholly owned insurance subsidiary and inter company notes as noted in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have numerous types of insurable risks  including workers compensation  product and general liability  automobile  warranty  and asbestos and environmental claims 
also  as discussed in note  we sell extended service contracts to our customers 
the associated risks are managed through our wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
in accordance with applicable insurance regulations  the insurance subsidiary holds investment grade securities to support the insurance coverage it provides 
we have transferred certain domestic real estate and intellectual property ie trademarks into separate wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiaries 
these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries lease the real estate property to sears and license the use of the trademarks to sears and kmart 
further  the bankruptcy remote subsidiaries have issued asset backed notes that are collateralized by the aforementioned real estate rental streams and intellectual property licensing fee streams 
cash flows received from rental streams and licensing fee streams paid by sears  kmart and  potentially in the future  other affiliates or third parties will be used for the payment of fees  interest and principal on the asset backed notes issued 
since the inception of these subsidiaries  the debt securities have been entirely held by our wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries in support of our insurance activities

royalty license fees represent the minimum holdings is obligated to pay  regardless of sales  as guaranteed royalties under these license agreements 
as of january   our fin liability and fin gross interest payable were million and million  respectively 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of fin liability and interest payments in individual years due to the uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 
other commercial commitments we issue various types of guarantees in the normal course of business 
we had the following guarantees outstanding as of january  millions bank issued srac issued other total standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit secondary lease obligations and performance guarantee the secondary lease obligations relate to certain store leases of previously divested sears businesses 
we remain secondarily liable if the primary obligor defaults 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the financial statements  certain accounting policies require considerable judgment to select the appropriate assumptions to calculate financial estimates 
these estimates are complex and subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  evaluation of trends and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change 
although the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the financial statements  we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or different estimates that could have been selected would have a material effect on our financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and the considerations used in estimating amounts  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the selection of these estimates 
the following is a summary of our most critical policies and estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a listing of our other significant accounting policies 
valuation of inventory our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined primarily using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
to determine inventory cost under rim  inventory at its retail selling value is segregated into groupings of merchandise having similar characteristics  which are then converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each grouping of merchandise 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise group based upon the fiscal year purchasing activity for each store location 
accordingly  a significant assumption under the retail method is that inventory in each group is similar in terms of its cost to retail relationship and has similar turnover rates 
management monitors the content of merchandise in these groupings to prevent distortions that would have a material effect on inventory valuation 
rim inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margin 
among others  two significant estimates used in inventory valuation are the level and timing of permanent markdowns clearance markdowns used to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory and shrinkage 
amounts are charged to cost of sales  buying and occupancy at the time the retail value of inventory is reduced through the use of permanent markdowns 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise  fashion trends and weather conditions 
in addition  inventory is also evaluated against corporate pre determined historical markdown cadences 
when a decision is made to permanently markdown merchandise  the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
the timing of the decision  particularly surrounding the balance sheet date  can have a significant effect on the results of operations 

table of contents shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the date of the last physical inventory to the end of the fiscal year 
physical inventories are taken at least annually for all stores on a staggered basis throughout the year and inventory records are adjusted accordingly 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience  is used as the basis for the shrinkage accrual following the physical inventory 
self insurance reserves we use a combination of third party insurance and or self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  asbestos and environmental  automobile  warranty  product and general liability claims 
general liability costs relate primarily to litigation that arises from store operations 
self insurance reserves include actuarial estimates of both claims filed and carried at their expected ultimate settlement value and claims incurred but not yet reported 
our estimated claim amounts are discounted using a rate with a duration that approximates the duration of our self insurance reserve portfolio 
our liability reflected on the consolidated balance sheets represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating this liability  we utilize loss development factors based on company specific data to project the future development of incurred losses 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
these projections are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
although we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from the historical trends and the actuarial assumptions 
defined benefit retirement plans the fundamental components of accounting for defined benefit retirement plans consist of the compensation cost of the benefits earned  the interest cost from deferring payment of those benefits into the future and the results of investing any assets set aside to fund the obligation 
such retirement benefits were earned by associates ratably over their service careers 
therefore  the amounts reported in the income statement for these retirement plans have historically followed the same pattern 
accordingly  changes in the obligations or the value of assets to fund them have been recognized systematically and gradually over the associate s estimated period of service 
the largest drivers of experience losses in recent years have been the discount rate used to determine the present value of the obligation and the actual return on pension assets 
we recognize the changes by amortizing experience gains losses in excess of the corridor into expense over the associate service period and by recognizing the difference between actual and expected asset returns over a five year period 
effective january   kmart s pension plans were frozen  and associates no longer earn additional benefits under the plans 
therefore  there are no assumptions related to future compensation costs relating to the kmart pension plans 
during the first quarter of  holdings announced that the sears domestic pension plan would be frozen effective january  accordingly  domestic associates have earned no additional benefits subsequent to december  benefits earned through december  will be paid out to eligible participants following retirement 
the kmart tax qualified defined benefit pension plan was merged with and into the sears domestic pension plan effective as of the end of the day january  the merged plan was renamed as the sears holdings pension plan shc domestic plan and holdings accepted sponsorship of the shc domestic plan effective as of that date 
holdings actuarial valuations utilize key assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  changes in investment strategies  higher or lower withdrawal rates  and longer or shorter life spans of participants

fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain  the company may record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
prior to the adoption of fin on february   we recorded tax contingencies based on the accounting guidance set forth in sfas no 
 which requires a contingency to be both probable and reasonably estimable for a loss to be recorded 
upon adoption of fin  holdings began recording unrecognized tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns  including the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return  when a more likely than not threshold is met for a tax position and management believes that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
in accordance with fin  we record the largest amount of the unrecognized tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position  assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and  if so  the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  if any 
in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets  management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income 
our actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items  including changes in income tax laws  tax planning and the company s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
although management believes current estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
domestic and foreign tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions we record reserves in accordance with the provisions of fin a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
management s estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change

goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments at january  and february  we had goodwill and intangible asset balances of billion and billion  respectively 
holdings evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the majority of our goodwill and intangible assets relate to kmart s acquisition of sears  roebuck and co 
in march the remaining goodwill amounts were recorded as part of our subsequent acquisitions of additional minority interest in sears canada 
we allocate goodwill  which is defined as the total purchase price less the fair value of all assets and liabilities acquired  to reporting units as of the acquisition date 
as required by sfas no 
 we perform annual goodwill and intangible impairment tests in the fourth quarter and update the tests between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

table of contents a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value using the best information available  including market information and discounted cash flow projections also referred to as the income approach 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales  costs  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding goodwill and related impairment charges recorded during fiscal a key assumption in our fair value estimate is the weighted average cost of capital utilized for discounting our cash flow projections in our income approach 
we believe the rate we used is consistent with the risks inherent in our business and with industry discount rates 
we performed sensitivity analyses on our estimated fair value using the income approach 
holding all other assumptions constant as of the measurement date  we noted that an increase in the weighted average cost of capital of basis points would result in our moving to the second step of the impairment test for an additional reporting unit that has approximately million of our goodwill 
we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach 
a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face market risk exposure in the form of interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and equity price risk 
these market risks arise from our derivative financial instruments and debt obligations 
interest rate risk we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed and variable rate funding and interest rate derivatives 
as of january   we had interest rate derivatives with a notional amount of million  nominal fair value and a weighted average remaining life of years 
all debt securities and interest rate derivative instruments are considered non trading 
as of january   of our debt portfolio was variable rate 
based on the size of this variable rate debt portfolio at january   which totaled approximately million  an immediate basis point change in interest rates would have affected annual pretax funding costs by million 
these estimates do not take into account the effect on income resulting from invested cash or the returns on assets being funded 
these estimates also assume that the variable rate funding portfolio remains constant for an annual period and that the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period 

table of contents foreign currency risk we  from time to time  enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which have typically been designated and qualify as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of our net investment in sears canada 
we had no such foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of january  sears canada mitigates the risk of currency fluctuations on offshore merchandise purchases denominated in us currency by purchasing us dollar denominated option contracts for a portion of its expected requirements 
as of january   these contracts had a notional value of approximately million and a weighted average remaining life of years 
the aggregate fair value of the option contracts as of january  was million 
a hypothetical adverse movement in the level of the canadian exchange rate relative to the us dollar as of january   with all other variables held constant  would have resulted in a fair value for these contracts of approximately million as of january   a decrease of million 
counterparties we actively manage the risk of nonpayment by our derivative counterparties by limiting our exposure to individual counterparties based on credit ratings and maturities 
the counterparties to these instruments are major financial institutions with credit ratings of single a or better 
in certain cases  counterparty risk is also managed through the use of collateral in the form of cash or us government securities
