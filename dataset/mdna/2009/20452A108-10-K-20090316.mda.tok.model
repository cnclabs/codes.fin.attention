table of contents overview we are a leading provider of enterprise class network storage solutions that are highly scalable  feature rich and designed to be easy to use and cost effective 
our storage center solution is a storage area network  or san  that enables users to intelligently store  recover and manage large amounts of data by combining our sophisticated software with standards based hardware into a single integrated solution 
as of december   storage center was being utilized by more than  enterprises worldwide  across a wide variety of industries including education  financial services  government  healthcare  insurance  legal  media  retail  technology and transportation 
we believe that storage center is the most comprehensive enterprise class network storage solution available today  providing increased functionality and lower total cost of ownership when compared to competing storage systems 
we believe our business model is highly differentiated and provides us with several competitive advantages 
we sell our products through an all channel assisted sales model designed to enable us to quickly scale and cost effectively increase sales 
we have built a strong internal sales team  which is spread geographically throughout the united states  to assist our channel partners with  among other things  executive sales call  service and support offerings  product matter expertise  configuration and pricing  joint sales calls  product demonstrations and design assistance 
we also employ a virtual manufacturing strategy  which significantly reduces inventory and eliminates the need for in house or outsourced manufacturing 
we believe these combined strategies create an efficient and scalable business model that enables us to reduce operating costs and improve capital efficiency 
key financial measures and trends sources of revenue revenue is comprised of product revenue  consisting of software and hardware revenue  and product support and services revenue 
a sale of storage center is typically comprised of a an upfront fully paid perpetual end user license fee  b the associated hardware components  c a software maintenance arrangement that includes telephone support  bug fixes and potential unspecified product updates  d a hardware maintenance agreement that includes telephone support and on site repairs and replacement and e in certain cases  professional services for installation  training and consulting support 
substantially all of our revenue consists of product revenue from sales of storage center 
we expect that product support and services revenue will grow on an absolute basis as our installed base of end users continues to grow  but will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenue 
we offer our products and services through value added resellers  which we refer to as channel partners 
our channel partners purchase our products after they have received a purchase order from an end user  as they do not maintain an inventory of our products in anticipation of sales to end users 
for  and  our top ten channel partners accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively 
one channel partner accounted for of total revenue during the year ended december  another channel partner accounted for and of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
no channel partner accounted for more than of total revenue for the year ended december  our systems are modular and highly configurable 
variations in these configurations affect our average system order size and can significantly impact our overall revenue  cost of revenue and gross margin performance 
our revenue within a particular quarter is often significantly affected by the unpredictable procurement patterns of our end users 
historically  we have generated the majority of our revenue in the final month of each quarter primarily because many of our end users do not finalize their purchasing decisions until the final weeks or days of a quarter 
we expect these purchasing patterns to continue in the future 
product revenue product revenue consists of license fees for software applications associated with storage center and related hardware sales  including disk drives  system controllers  host bus adapters  switches and enclosures 
we also derive a portion of our product revenue from software and hardware upgrades  which generally include additional hardware components and may include new software applications 
we expect that product revenue will increase on an absolute basis if we are able to execute our business strategy 

table of contents product support and services revenue product support and services revenue consists of software and hardware maintenance contracts  which typically have a duration of one to three years  and professional services for installation  training and consulting support 
maintenance 
we offer software maintenance that includes telephone support  bug fixes and unspecified product updates and hardware maintenance that includes telephone support and on site repairs and replacement 
substantially all of our end users purchase software and hardware maintenance agreements when they purchase storage center 
revenue is deferred at fair value in accordance with aicpa statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  or sop no 
 as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions at the time the maintenance agreement is entered into and is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
historically  substantially all of our end users have renewed their maintenance agreements upon expiration of their existing maintenance agreements 
we anticipate that maintenance revenue will grow on an absolute basis as our installed base of end users continues to grow  but will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenue 
professional services 
we generally sell professional services on a time and materials basis and recognize revenue when the services are performed 
professional services include installation  consulting and training 
we expect that professional services revenue will grow on an absolute basis as our installed base of end users continues to grow  but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenue 
cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue is comprised of cost of product revenue and cost of product support and services 
cost of product revenue consists primarily of the cost of component hardware charged by our component suppliers  shipping and handling  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  overhead allocations  and employee salaries  benefits  and stock based compensation expense 
we expect cost of product revenue to increase in absolute dollars  but remain relatively constant as a percentage of total product revenue 
cost of product support and services consists of employee salaries  benefits  and stock based compensation expense for our customer service and technical support team and service fees charged by anacomp  inc  our third party hardware maintenance provider 
we expect cost of product support and services revenue to increase as we expand the size of our customer service and technical support team and incur increased third party services fees associated with anticipated future revenue growth 
our gross margin has been and will be affected by many factors  including a the demand for storage center and related services  b discount levels and price competition  c average system order size and end user mix  d hardware and software component mix and e the level of fixed costs of customer service and personnel 
we do not expect any material changes to gross margin  as compared to current levels 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
we expect to continue to hire a significant number of new employees to support our anticipated growth 
our business strategy is to be a leading provider of enterprise class network storage solutions 
for us to achieve our goals  substantial investments in our infrastructure were  and continue to be  necessary to facilitate rapid expansion 
from corporate inception to product commercialization in early  our employee growth was predominantly focused in support of our product development  as seen by the increase in research and development expense during that time period 
when commercialization of our product occurred in early  our growth in operating costs was led by additional spending in sales and marketing  as evidenced by the increase in sales and marketing expense and corresponding headcount total since early our sales and marketing team geographically covers the entire united states  and certain international markets  with employees predominately located at either our corporate headquarters or working remotely 
with our increased sales and marketing headcount  and the correlating growth in our revenue  we have also expanded our support functions such as sales management  sales 
table of contents operations  information technology  finance and human resources to leverage our corporate structure to further our business strategy 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of a salaries  related personnel costs and stock based compensation expense for our sales and marketing personnel  b commissions  c travel expenses  d marketing programs and e other related overhead 
we expect sales and marketing expense to increase on an absolute basis for the foreseeable future as we increase the number of sales and marketing professionals and  to a lesser extent  increase our marketing activities 
we expect sales and marketing expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue if our revenue grows as we anticipate 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of a salaries  related personnel costs and stock based compensation expense for our research and development personnel  b depreciation on equipment and c other related overhead 
to date  all of our research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred 
we expect research and development expense to increase on an absolute basis for the foreseeable future as we enhance and expand our product offerings 
we expect research and development expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue if our revenue grows as we anticipate 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of a salaries  related personnel costs and stock based compensation for our finance  human resource  and information technology personnel and certain executive officers  b accounting  tax and legal professional fees and c other related overhead 
we expect general and administrative expense to increase on an absolute basis and as a percentage of total revenue in the short term as we continue to develop the infrastructure necessary to operate as a public company  including increased audit and legal fees  costs of compliance with securities and other regulations  implementation costs for compliance with the provisions of sarbanes oxley act of  investor relations expense and higher insurance premiums 
other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent and investment balances less interest expense 
income taxes the current tax benefits of our net losses have been offset by the recording of a full valuation allowance for the years ended december    and although we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in the past  we cannot be certain that the tax benefits of our net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards will be available to offset future income tax expense when taxable income is realized 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that effect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
in many cases  we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
see the notes to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for information about these critical accounting policies  as well as a description of our other accounting policies 

table of contents revenue recognition we apply the provisions of sop no 
and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  to our combined software and hardware product sales 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists by receiving a purchase order or by obtaining a signed quote 
delivery has occurred 
substantially all products are shipped to end users 
delivery is deemed to have occurred upon shipment as title transfers to the end user 
products shipped with acceptance criteria are not recognized as revenue until all conditional criteria are satisfied 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
fees are considered fixed and determinable upon establishment of an arrangement that contains the final terms of sale including description  quantity and price of each product or service purchased  and the payment term is less than twelve months 
collectibility is probable 
probability of collection is assessed on a case by case basis 
customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
if we are unable to determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is probable based upon our review process  revenue is recognized upon cash receipt 
we use resellers  who act as brokers  to sell our products and refer to such resellers as our channel partners 
revenue under reseller arrangements is not recognized until shipment occurs to the end user  the fee is fixed and determinable  collectibility is probable and supported  and there is evidence of a third party end user sale  generally in the form of a purchase order from the end user to the channel partner 
our revenue is the price we charge the channel partner 
we maintain contractual arrangements with our channel partners  which contain provisions that specify that the risk of loss and title transfers upon shipment to the end user 
in circumstances where we sell directly to an end user  our revenue is the price we charge the end user and revenue is recognized upon shipment to the end user 
a sale of our storage center is typically a multiple element arrangement including software  hardware  software maintenance  hardware maintenance and in certain cases services 
our determination of fair value of each element in these multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to all undelivered elements of a contract 
vsoe is evaluated and determined by us based on separate sales of the specific elements 
no software products remain undelivered at the inception of the arrangement 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from software and hardware is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with statement of position no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and revenue from software maintenance and hardware maintenance is recognized ratably over the respective support period 
for multiple element arrangements that include only hardware and hardware maintenance  we recognize revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf no 
we have determined that we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value  in accordance with eitf no 
 to allocate revenue separately to hardware and hardware maintenance 
we generally sell professional services on a time and materials basis and recognize revenue when the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts in the vast majority of sales  we sell our products to channel partners for resale to end users 
in certain limited circumstances  we may sell directly to the end user and pay the channel partner a commission  which is recorded in sales and marketing expense  primarily due to concerns of the credit worthiness of the channel partner 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our channel partners and end users and continuously monitor collections and payments 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the underlying receivables  historical write off experience and any specific collection issues we have identified 
we monitor and analyze the accuracy of our 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts estimate by reviewing past collectibility and adjusting it for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our allowance 
to date  we have not incurred any write offs of accounts receivable significantly different than the amounts reserved 
we believe appropriate reserves have been established  but may not be indicative of future credit losses 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and was  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our channel partners or end users were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation inventories are recorded at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out method  or market value estimated net realizable value 
each quarter  we evaluate our inventories for obsolescence and excess quantities 
this evaluation includes analysis of current inventory levels  expected product lives  historical loss trends and projections of future sales demand 
inventories that are considered obsolete are written off  and a reserve for inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand is recorded 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than current estimates  additional inventory write downs would be required and would adversely affect income in the period the write down is made 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and non employee directors based on fair value 
sfas no 
r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for periods beginning in fiscal we adopted sfas no 
r using the prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation expense recognized for included compensation expense for all stock option grants granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the prospective transition method  our statements of operations for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no 
r 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock option grants requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards 
stock based compensation expense is significant to our financial statements and is calculated using our best estimates  which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
significant estimates include the risk free interest rate  the expected life of the option  stock price volatility  the dividend yield and the forfeiture rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield available on us treasury zero coupon bonds at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at the grant date 
the expected life of the options is based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior 
volatility is based on historic volatilities from traded shares of a selected publicly traded peer group  believed to be comparable after consideration of size  maturity  profitability  growth  risk and return on investment 
we have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to in the foreseeable future 
we utilize historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
forfeitures have been insignificant during each of the periods presented herein 
any changes in these highly subjective assumptions may significantly impact the stock based compensation expense recognized  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
stock based compensation expense recorded during  and was million   and  respectively 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas no 
 as clarified by financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainties in income taxes  or fin no 
under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the 
table of contents assets or liabilities from year to year 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria of sfas no 
fin no 
requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of nol carryforwards 
as of december   we had federal and state nol carryforwards of approximately million  which may be used to offset future taxable income 
the nol carryforwards expire at various times through and are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service and state authorities 
under the provisions of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of nol carryforwards that can be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
if a change in our ownership is deemed to have occurred or occurs in the future  our ability to use our nol carryforwards in any year may be limited 
based on the level of projected future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  and our past history of losses  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
accordingly  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as of december  and of million and million  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investments to fluctuate 
by policy  we minimize risk by placing our investments with high quality debt security issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and corporate debt securities 
our investment policy prohibits investment in derivative instruments 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december  primarily included liquid money market accounts and are held with high quality financial institutions and at times  such balances may be in excess of insurance limits 
our investments as of december  included federal agency securities  corporate debt securities  certificates of deposit  and variable rate demand notes 
our investments in variable rate demand notes are not subject to auction risk 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on our variable and fixed rate financial investments 
according to our analysis  if our blended rate of return decreased by in  our interest income for would have declined by approximately  while we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity  we have taken steps  including regularly reviewing our investments and associated risk profiles  which we believe will allow us to effectively manage the risks of our investment portfolio
