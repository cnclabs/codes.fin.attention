item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes of energysolutions included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors 
overview we are a leading provider of specialized  technology based nuclear services to government and commercial customers 
our customers rely on our expertise to address their needs throughout the lifecycle of their nuclear operations 
our broad range of nuclear services includes engineering  operation of nuclear reactors  in plant support services  spent nuclear fuel management  d d  logistics  transportation  processing and disposal 
we derive almost of our revenues from the provision of nuclear services 
we provide our services through four segments federal services  commercial services  lp d and international 
our federal services segment derives revenues from us government customers for the m o or clean up of facilities with radioactive materials 
our us government customers are primarily individual offices  departments and administrations within the doe and dod 
our commercial services segment provides a broad range of on site services  including d d  to commercial customers 
our commercial customers include power and utility companies  pharmaceutical companies  research laboratories  universities  industrial facilities and other commercial entities with nuclear materials  as well as state agencies in the united states 
our lp d segment provides a broad range of logistics  transportation  processing and disposal services to government and commercial customers 
this segment also operates our facilities for the safe processing and disposal of radioactive materials  including a facility in clive  utah  four facilities in tennessee and two facilities in barnwell  south carolina 
in cases where a project involves the provision of both specialized nuclear services and processing and disposal services  our federal services or commercial services segment  depending on the type of customer  and our lp d segment will coordinate to provide integrated services 
prior to our acquisitions of rsmc in and safeguard in  we derived less than of our revenues from our international operations 
accordingly  through the first quarter of  we reported results from 
table of contents our international operations in our commercial services segment 
beginning with the second quarter of  we began reporting results from our operations outside north america in a new international segment in connection with our acquisition of rsmc 
components of revenues and expenses revenues and costs of revenues federal services segment we generate revenues in our federal services segment primarily from m o and clean up services on doe and dod sites that have radioactive materials 
under tier contracts  we typically provide services as an integrated member of a prime contract team 
under a tier contract  we provide services to tier contractors as a subcontractor 
tier contracts often include an award fee in excess of incurred costs and may also include an incentive fee for meeting contractual targets  milestones or performance factors 
these award fees often are not associated with significant additional expenditures 
historically  the majority of our federal services segment revenues have been generated from either tier cost reimbursable contracts with award typically expressed as a percentage of cost or incentive typically success based fees or tier contracts that can be cost reimbursable  fixed price or unit rate contracts 
when we have provided services as an integrated member of a tier prime contract team  we have typically entered into a contract with the other members of the team pursuant to which we share the award or incentive fees under the customer contract 
the revenue characteristics of these contracts are as follows tier contract  acting as lead prime contractor 
in situations where we act as lead prime contractor in a fee share arrangement  we submit invoices to the customer for recovery of costs incurred in providing project services and also submit to the customer the cost recovery invoices of the other team members that have been submitted to us 
depending on the nature of the contract  we typically recognize the entire amount of our fee and cost reimbursement as lead prime contractor as revenue and record an expense for the portion of the fee and cost reimbursement that we pay to the other team members in proportion to their respective percentages of the fee share arrangement and costs 
as a result  when we act as lead prime contractor  we may realize higher gross profit but lower gross margin than when we do not act as lead prime contractor 
tier contract  not acting as lead prime contractor 
in situations where we do not act as lead prime contractor  we submit invoices to the lead prime contractor for recovery of costs incurred in providing project services  including allocated selling  general and administrative expenses  as allowed by the customer  and we may receive a portion of the fee in direct proportion to our percentage of the fee share arrangement 
we include in revenues the amount to be received as reimbursement for costs incurred plus the portion of the fee that we will receive 
the majority of our tier contracts have historically fallen into this category 
tier contract 
tier contracts are typically discrete  project driven opportunities procured by tier contractors 
the majority of tier contracts are fixed price or cost reimbursable contracts 
we generally do not participate in fee share arrangements as a tier contractor 
revenues in our federal services segment can fluctuate significantly from period to period because of differences in the timing and size of contract awards in any given period  whether or not we are required to consolidate revenues under a joint venture agreement  the completion or expiration of large contracts and delays in congressional appropriations for contracts we have been awarded 
we typically generate revenues in our federal services segment pursuant to long term contracts 
the process of bidding for government contracts is extremely competitive and time consuming 

table of contents discussions relating to a potential government contract often begin one or two years before an official request for proposal  or rfp  is announced 
an additional one or two years may pass between the government s announcement of an rfp and its award of a contract 
third party consulting and bid preparation expenses associated with bidding for a tier contract typically range from  to million and are recognized as incurred in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these are in addition to our internal expenses and corporate overhead 
once awarded a contract  an additional several months may pass before we begin to recognize revenues in connection with that contract 
costs of revenues in our federal services segment primarily consist of compensation and benefits to employees  outsourcing costs for subcontractor services  costs of goods purchased for use in projects and travel expenses 
commercial services segment we generate revenues in our commercial services segment through fixed price  unit rate and cost reimbursable contracts with power and utility companies that operate nuclear power plants and  to a lesser extent  with pharmaceutical companies  research laboratories  universities  industrial facilities and other commercial entities that have nuclear related operations 
most of the revenues in our commercial services segment currently derive from contracts with a term of less than one year 
revenues in our commercial services segment can fluctuate significantly from period to period because of differences in customer requirements  which depend upon the operating schedules of nuclear reactors  emergency response operations and other clean up events 
the operating schedules of nuclear reactors are affected by  among other things  seasonality in the demand for electricity and reactor refueling and maintenance 
power and utility companies typically schedule refueling and maintenance to coincide with periods of reduced power demand periods in the spring and fall 
therefore  our revenues are typically higher during these periods due to the increased demand for our on site services  such as spent fuel services 
our revenues also fluctuate from period to period as our commercial power and utility customers commence or terminate project operations 
revenues from emergency response operations and other clean ups may also cause fluctuations in our results due to the unanticipated nature and  often  significant size of these projects 
revenues in our commercial services segment also depend on the decisions of our customers to incur expenditures for third party nuclear services 
for example  they may choose to store radioactive materials on site  rather than transporting materials for commercial processing and disposal at a third party facility  such as our clive facility 
similarly  customers may defer entering into contracts for the d d of nuclear plants that have been shut down until such time as they have additional dedicated funds 
costs of revenues in our commercial services segment primarily consist of compensation and benefits to employees  outsourcing costs for subcontractor services  costs of goods purchased for use in projects and travel expenses 
results of our operations for services provided to our customers in canada and mexico currently relate to services provided to our utility customers and are included in our commercial services segment with the exception of monserco  which is included in lp d 
lp d segment we generate revenues in our lp d segment primarily through unit rate contracts for the transportation  processing and disposal of radioactive materials 
in general  the unit rate contracts entered into by our lp d segment use a standardized set of purchase order type contracts containing standard pricing and other terms 
by using standardized contracts  we are able to expedite individual project contract negotiations with customers through means other than a formal bidding process 
for 
table of contents example  our life of plant contracts provide nuclear power and utility company customers with llrw and mllw processing and disposal services for the remaining lives of their nuclear power plants  as well as the d d waste disposal services after the plants are shut down 
these contracts generally provide that we will process and dispose of substantially all of the llrw and mllw generated by those plants for a fixed  pre negotiated price per cubic foot  depending on the type of radioactive material being disposed  and often provide for periodic price adjustments 
although a life of plant contract may be terminated before decommissioning is complete  we typically expect the duration of these contracts to be approximately years 
revenues in our lp d segment can fluctuate significantly depending on the timing of our customers decommissioning activities 
we often receive high volumes of radioactive materials in a relatively short time period when a customer s site or facility is being decommissioned 
costs of revenues in our lp d segment primarily consist of compensation and benefits to employees  outsourcing costs for subcontractor services  such as railroads transporting radioactive materials from a customer s site to one of our facilities for processing and disposal  costs of goods purchased for use in our facilities  licenses  permits  taxes on processed radioactive materials  maintenance of facilities  equipment costs and depreciation costs 
most of our fixed assets are in our lp d segment 
as a result  we recognize the majority of our depreciation costs in this segment 
international segment we generate revenues in our international segment primarily through tier contracts with the nda 
as a tier contractor  we are reimbursed for allowable incurred costs 
in addition  we receive cost efficiency fees a percentage of budgeted costs minus actual costs for work performed and project delivery based incentive fees 
we typically recognize as revenues the full amount of reimbursed allowable costs incurred plus the amount of fees earned  and we record as expense the amount of our operating costs  including all labor  benefits and travel expenses and costs of our subcontractors 
we only recognize fees as revenue when the amount to be received is fixed or determinable 
our contracts with the nda allow for a portion of the fees to be paid monthly on account during the year 
the total amount paid on account at the year end cannot exceed a combined of the total base incentive fee available and of the efficiency fee earned 
for the first six months of the contract year  which ends march  we receive monthly on account payments of fees equivalent to of the total available fees for the contract year  although the monthly amount of the base incentive fee may be increased to reflect actual fees earned in the period if mutually agreed 
the contract requires a joint review with the nda of performance at the end of the sixth month and the ninth month of the contract year 
the purpose of the review is to establish a forecast of fees expected to be earned in the year  against which future scheduled monthly fee payments are assessed  and potentially adjusted  to ensure that the total fees paid on account by the end of the contract year will not exceed the contractual limits 
in april  following the end of the contract year  we expect to finalize any earned but unpaid incentive and efficiency fees due from the nda and receive a corresponding final fee payment 
given our contractual fee mechanism  a greater portion of efficiency fees are recognized in march  which is the final month of the contract year 
as a result  we expect first quarter revenues in our international segment to exceed revenues in that segment during any other quarter of the year 
the nda contracts are based on an annual funding cycle and incentive plan 
consequently  revenues can vary from year to year depending on the level of annual funding  the nature of performance based incentives negotiated and efficiency fee mechanisms in place 
cost of revenues in our international segment primarily consist of compensation and benefits to employees  travel expenses  outsourcing costs for subcontractor services and costs of goods purchased for use in projects 

table of contents the international segment also includes the results of safeguard s project activities and other projects performed outside of north america 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include expenses that are not directly associated with performing nuclear services for our customers 
these expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits for management and administrative personnel  preparing contract bids  office expenses  advisory fees  professional fees  strategic growth initiatives  such as research and development  and administrative overhead 
we segregate our sg a expenses into two categories for reporting purposes 
segment sg a reflects costs specifically associated with each of our business segments  such as costs for segment leadership compensation and expenses  specific business development activities  and other costs associated with a specific segment 
corporate sg a reflects costs associated with supporting the entire company including executive management and administrative functions such as accounting  treasury  legal  human resources and information technology  and other costs required to support the company 
corporate sg a also includes the advisory fees we have paid to affiliates of lindsay goldberg bessemer lp  peterson partners  inc and creamer investments  inc  all members of env holdings  llc  under various advisory services agreements 
see certain relationships and related party transactions 
these agreements were terminated in connection with the completion of our initial public offering on november  interest expense interest expense includes both cash and accrued interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs and fees and interest paid on outstanding letters of credit 
other income  net other income  net includes interest income  mark to market gains and losses on our derivative contracts  transactional foreign currency gains and losses and our proportional share of income from joint ventures in which we have a non controlling interest 
outlook we expect the following factors to affect our results of operations in future periods 
in addition to these factors  please refer to risk factors for additional information on what could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations 
revenues will be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
during the year ended december   revenues from our international segment were of our total consolidated revenues 
most of our revenues in our international segment are derived from contracts with the nda in the uk which are denominated in pound sterling 
over the past months  the value of the pound sterling has declined significantly from on august  to on february  as a result of this decline  we expect our consolidated revenues to decrease between million and million in change in gross margin 
our gross profit as a percentage of revenues has declined over the past three years as a result of our acquisitions of duratek and rsmc 
the year ended december  was the first year that included a full year of operations from all of our acquired entities 
our gross margin was for the year ended december  during the year ended december   revenues from our contracts with the nda were of our total consolidated revenues and our gross margin from these contracts was for the year ended 
table of contents december  therefore  our gross margin is significantly impacted by the gross margin from these contracts  which is expected to be fairly stable 
however  our gross margin can be significantly affected by the gross margin for our lp d segment 
a significant amount of the costs in our lp d segment are fixed  therefore  any change in revenues of our lp d segment has more of an impact on our gross margin 
gross margins for our lp d segment were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues for our lp d segment were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses for to remain consistent with the expenses for after excluding the management compensation expense of million that was paid at the direction of and fully reimbursed by env holdings llc 
equity based compensation expense 
pursuant to sfas no 
r  share based payment  we account for equity based compensation payments  including grants to employees  based on the fair values of the equity instruments issued 
we incurred non cash compensation expense of  in  million in and million in related to profit interest units granted in env holdings llc in connection with the acquisition of envirocare in and our acquisitions of bnga and duratek in we expect that the equity based compensation expense related to the vesting of these units will be approximately  in in addition  we have options to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock and we have  unvested restricted shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  we recognized compensation expense of million and million in and  respectively  and expect to record compensation expense of million in as a result of these outstanding options and unvested restricted shares 
during  we expect to grant additional stock options and restricted stock and expect to record compensation expense of million in as a result of these grants 
capital expenditures 
we expect capital expenditures in to be approximately million  relating primarily to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system oracle ebs r and equipment to be used at our decommissioning sites and at our facilities 
most of our capital expenditures of approximately million in related to required equipment for the atlas mill tailings contract awarded to us in june and equipment at our facilities 
we had capital expenditures of million and million in and  respectively 
most of our capital expenditures during related primarily to equipment at our facilities 
we completed several significant capital improvements in  including the installation of a new metal shredder  rail handling loop  rotary dump and other physical improvements at our clive facility 
amortization costs related to intangible assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we expect non cash amortization costs to remain constant in  providing we do not acquire any significant businesses or intangible assets 
we incurred approximately million and million of non cash amortization expense in and  respectively  related to the intangible assets acquired in  and during  we incurred a full year of non cash amortization costs related to intangible assets acquired in our rsmc acquisition in june we expect to incur million of non cash amortization expense in income taxes 
our effective tax rate in was  which is lower than the blended statutory rate primarily due to the effect of research and development credits in the uk 
we anticipate our effective tax rate for  exclusive of any unusual items  will be approximately to

income taxes we recognized income tax expense of million for the year ended december  based on an estimated annual effective tax rate on our consolidated operations of  which is lower than the statutory rate of mostly due to the effect of research and development credits in the uk 
prior to our reorganization on november   energysolutions  llc operated as a limited liability company and was treated as a disregarded entity owned by a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
as such  during the year ended december   we recognized an income tax expense of million  primarily due to income tax expense recognized of approximately million relating to our reorganization from a limited liability company to a c corporation and foreign  federal and state income taxes for our taxable subsidiaries that we acquired in and year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of our acquisition of duratek on june   which contributed million to revenues in the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and our acquisition of rsmc  which contributed million to revenues for the post acquisition period of june  through december  the acquisitions of safeguard  parallax and nukem collectively contributed million to revenues during from their respective dates of acquisition 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues of million due to lower volumes of waste received at our facility in clive  utah

lp d segment revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we processed lower volumes of waste at our facility in clive  utah during the year ended december  due to the completion of several doe closure projects during the decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues of million during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of resulting from our duratek acquisition 
the duratek acquisition included the facilities in barnwell  south carolina and three processing and disposal facilities in tennessee 
cost of revenues cost of revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of our acquisition of duratek  which contributed million to cost of revenues in the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and our acquisition of rsmc  which contributed million to cost of revenues for the post acquisition period of june  through december  the acquisitions of safeguard  parallax and 
table of contents nukem collectively contributed million to cost of revenues during from their respective dates of acquisition 
these increases in cost of revenues were partially offset by a decrease of million in our historical lp d operations  which was primarily the result of reduced expenses associated with processing lower volumes of waste at our facility in clive  utah due to the completion of several projects during primarily as a result of our acquisition of duratek  cost of revenues in our federal services segment and our commercial services segment increased to million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  from million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  as a result of our acquisitions of rsmc and safeguard  cost of revenues in our international segment was million for the year ended december  lp d segment cost of revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of increased expenses resulting from our acquisition of duratek  which contributed million to cost of revenues for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in our historical lp d operations associated with the completion of several doe closure projects during cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the acquisitions of duratek and rsmc significantly changed our revenue mix when compared to our historical operations 
as a result  a greater portion of our revenues have significantly lower contribution margins 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in our lp d segment  which includes our historical operations  increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period for a significant amount of the costs at our clive  utah facility are fixed  therefore  the decrease in our revenues of million at our clive  utah facility had a significant adverse impact on our margins 
in addition  cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues relating to operations from our duratek acquisition are greater than that of our historical operations  thus contributing to the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues for this segment 
our federal services  commercial services and international segments  which primarily include operations of duratek and rsmc from their acquisition dates  collectively contributed cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues of for the year ended december  compared to for the same period for this increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of rsmc  where cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues were for the year ended december  gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit increased primarily due to the acquisition of duratek  which contributed million and million to gross profit in our federal services and commercial services segments  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to million and million  respectively for the year ended december  this increase in gross profit was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit in our lp d segment resulting from lower volumes of waste at our facility in clive  utah during the year ended december  due to the completion of several significant doe closure projects during our gross margin decreased to in the period from  in the corresponding period due largely to change in revenue mix combined with lower margins in our lp d segment 
primarily as a result of our acquisition of duratek  gross profit in our federal services segment and our commercial services segment increased to million and million  respectively  for the 
table of contents year ended december  compared to million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  as a result of our acquisitions of safeguard and rsmc  gross profit in our international segment was million for the year ended december  lp d segment gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  lp d segment gross profit margin decreased to during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  gross profit and gross profit margin decreased primarily due to decreased revenues as a result of the completion of several significant doe closure projects in our historical lp d segment during and lower gross profit margins in the lp d operations we acquired from duratek as compared to our historical operations 
segment selling  general and administrative expenses segment selling  general and administrative expenses in our federal services and commercial services segments increased million and  respectively  to million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  from million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  this is primarily the result of increased expenses due to the activity of duratek  which was acquired in june segment selling  general and administrative expenses in our lp d segment increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of the activity of duratek  which was acquired in june segment selling general and administrative expenses in our international segment were million for the year ended december  primarily due to bid and proposal expenses relating to potential contracts in the united kingdom  the operations of safeguard  which we acquired in december  and the operations and amortization expense associated with finite lived intangible assets of rsmc  which we acquired in june total segment selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period for primarily due to increased revenues 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses corporate selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  corporate selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period for this decrease was primarily due to non cash equity compensation expenses incurred during the year ended december  as a result of accelerated vesting of profits interests in connection with our acquisition of duratek in the earlier period 
this decrease is partially offset by increased accounting  treasury  human resources  information systems and other administrative expenses as a result of our acquisition of duratek and a million expense for the termination of provisions in employment agreements related to excess performance bonus payments 
these provisions were terminated in connection with our initial public offering 
interest expense interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to increased borrowings related to the acquisitions of duratek and rsmc and the write off of 
table of contents unamortized debt financing fees of million as a result of repayment of our debt using proceeds from our initial public offering 
these increases are offset by the recognition of a call premium of million and a write off of debt financing fees and loan discounts of million which occurred in june in connection with the restructuring of our long term debt 
other income expense  net other income  net  increased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this amount primarily reflects increases in interest income and our proportional share of income from three joint ventures in which we have a non controlling interest 
this increase is offset by losses on our derivative contracts of million 
income taxes we recognized income tax expense of million for the year ended december  primarily due to income tax expense recognized of approximately million relating to our reorganization from a limited liability company to a c corporation 
prior to our reorganization on november   energysolutions  llc operated as a limited liability company and was treated as a disregarded entity owned by a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that the tax effect of recognizing deferred tax items upon a change in tax status be included in current year operations 
in addition  income tax expense for includes foreign  federal and state income taxes for our taxable subsidiaries that we acquired in and we recognized income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  attributable to net taxable loss from bnga and duratek since their acquisitions on february  and june   respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents and million of availability under the million revolving portion of our credit facilities  which is net of million of outstanding letters of credit 
we also have a synthetic letter of credit facility of million  of which million of letters of credit were issued as of december  during the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents increased million  to million 
this compares to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we had net cash inflows from operating activities of million 
this was offset by net cash outflows from investing activities of million  primarily related to purchases of property  plant and equipment 
our cash outflows from our financing activities were million  primarily related repayment of debt and payments of stockholder dividends and debt financing fees offset by proceeds from the settlement of our derivative contracts 
during the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents increased million  to million 
this compares to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we had net cash inflows from operating activities of million and cash inflows from financing activities of million  primarily due to proceeds from our initial public offering offset by the repayment of debt  dividends paid and increased debt financing fees 
this was offset by net cash outflows from investing activities of million related primarily to our acquisitions of rsmc  parallax  nukem and monserco and purchases of property  plant and equipment 

table of contents our principal need for liquidity has been  and will continue to be  for working capital  to pay down debt and for capital expenditures 
we also expect to use cash flow from operations to pay quarterly dividends 
however  the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors  including our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity requirements  restrictions that may be imposed by applicable law and our contracts and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
to the extent we maintain an annual dividend of per share  our annual cash requirements for this dividend would be million  based on the number of shares currently outstanding 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under the revolving portion of our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our future liquidity needs  including the payment of such dividend  through at least the next twelve months 
we have accumulated benefit obligations related to our pension plans of billion 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for a more detailed discussion 
approximately of the accumulated benefit obligation relates to the magnox north and magnox south pension plans the magnox plans 
the magnox plans are funded by contributions from employees and the nda pursuant to a contractual arrangement 
as a result  we are reimbursed for contributions made to the magnox plans under the terms of these contracts 
thus  we have no potential net funding requirements relative to the accumulated benefit obligation 
the plan we are required to fund related to our rsmc employees is currently funded by employee contributions until the year at the earliest 
therefore  we do not expect there to be any implications to our liquidity within the next months resulting from potential incremental cash payments to maintain funding requirements 
although we have no specific current plans to do so  if we decide to pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions  we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance the purchase of those businesses 
historical cash flows cash flow from operating activities we generated million of cash from operating activities during the year ended december  cash from operating activities in included net income of million and significant non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization expense of million and foreign currency transaction losses of million 
cash from operating activities was also provided by a reduction in accounts receivable of million primarily due to timing of collections on work performed on our contracts with the nda 
cash from operating activities was used to reduce accounts payable and accrued liabilities by million 
the reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to timing of payments to vendors of our magnox contracts in the uk 
in addition  cash from operating activities of million was used for costs associated with our planned license stewardship project for exelon s zion nuclear facility that have been deferred until closing of the transaction 
we generated million of cash from operating activities during the year ended december  cash from operating activities in included net loss of million and significant non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization expense of million 
cash from operating activities was also provided by million of restricted cash that became unrestricted as a result of an insurance policy put in place as collateral for certain decommissioning liabilities 
cash from operating activities was also provided as a result of increased collections on contract receivables of million  a reduction in prepaid expenses and other assets of million and reduced payments of accounts payable of million 

table of contents cash flow from investing activities we used million of cash for investing activities during the year ended december  of this amount  we used million of cash for capital expenditures primarily to purchase equipment required for the atlas mill tailings contract  equipment at our various facilities  computer hardware and software licenses 
we used million of cash for investing activities during the year ended december  we used million for the acquisitions of rsmc  parallax nukem and monserco and million for capital expenditures primarily to purchase equipment at our various facilities and computer hardware 
cash flow from financing activities we used million of cash for financing activities during the year ended december  primarily to repay million of long term debt  to pay dividends of million to our shareholders and to pay debt financing fees of million 
we received net million as settlement of our interest rate and foreign currency derivative contracts 
we generated million of cash from financing activities during the year ended december  we received proceeds of million from the issuance of our common stock  net of issuance costs  and million from borrowings of long term debt 
we used cash to repay long term debt of million  to pay debt financing fees of million  and to pay distributions of million 
capital expenditures we had capital expenditures of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we completed several significant capital improvements and  including the equipment required for the atlas mill tailings contract during and the installation of a new shredder  rail handling loop and rotary dump at our clive facility in we expect purchases of capital expenditures for the year ending december  will be approximately million  relating primarily to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system oracle ebs r and equipment to be used at our decommissioning sites and at our facilities  which is in compliance with the debt covenants of our credit agreement 
we anticipate the sources of funds for our anticipated capital expenditures will come from cash flows provided by our operating activities 
credit facilities we have entered into credit facilities with citicorp north america  inc  or cnai  as administrative agent and collateral agent 
the credit facilities consist of a million revolving credit facility  which matures on june   million first lien term loan facilities  which mature on june   and a million synthetic letter of credit facility  which matures on june  the obligations under the credit facilities are unconditional and irrevocably guaranteed by each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries 
in addition  the credit facilities and such guarantees are secured on a first and second priority basis by security interests subject to permitted liens as defined in the credit agreements governing the credit facilities in substantially all tangible and intangible assets owned by us and each of our domestic subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions  including limiting pledges of voting stock of foreign subsidiaries to of voting stock of first tier foreign subsidiaries 
borrowings under the credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to in the case of the first lien term loans  i the greater of the rate of interest announced by cnai  from time to time  as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in the city of new york  and the federal funds rate plus per annum the base rate  plus or when the leverage ratio as defined in the 
table of contents credit agreements as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter is less than to or ii for any portion of the term loans as to which we have elected to pay interest on a eurodollar basis  libor plus or when the leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreements as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter is less than to  in the case of the revolving loans  i the base rate plus or ii for any portion of the revolving loans as to which we have elected to pay interest on a eurodollar basis  libor plus in the case of synthetic letters of credit under the first lien credit facilities  or when the leverage ratio as defined in the related credit agreement as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter is less than to 
commencing september  and at the end of each calendar quarter for the next quarters  the first lien term loans under the credit facilities amortize in quarterly installments of million  adjusted for optional prepayments made  provided that the final installment shall be equal to the amount outstanding in respect of the term loans 
we are generally also required to prepay borrowings under the credit facilities with of the net proceeds we receive from non ordinary course asset sales or as a result of a casualty or condemnation  subject to reinvestment provisions  of the net proceeds we receive from the issuance of debt obligations other than specified debt obligations and the excess  if any  of or  if our leverage ratio is less than and greater than  of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreements reduced by the aggregate amount of term loans optionally prepaid during the applicable fiscal year 
under the credit facilities  we are not required to prepay borrowings with excess cash flow if our leverage ratio is less than or equal to as of december   we were required to make a mandatory prepayment of approximately million based on our excess cash flow 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate under our credit facilities was 
at this rate and assuming an outstanding balance of million as of december   our annual debt service obligations would be million  consisting of million of interest and million of scheduled principal payments 
however  due to optional prepayments made through december   only million of our scheduled principal payments are currently due within the next year 
the credit facilities require us to maintain certain financial ratios  including maximum leverage ratios based upon the ratios of consolidated funded debt and first lien indebtedness to consolidated operating cash flow and a minimum cash interest coverage ratio based upon the ratio of consolidated operating cash flow to consolidated cash interest expense  which are tested quarterly 
based on the formulas set forth in the credit agreements as december   we are required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a first lien leverage ratio of and  respectively  and minimum cash interest coverage ratio of 
failure to comply with these financial ratio covenants would result in a default under our credit facilities and  absent a waiver or an amendment from the lenders  preclude us from making further borrowings under our credit facilities and permit the lenders to accelerate all outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities 
as of december   our total leverage  first lien leverage and interest coverage ratios were  and  respectively 
as such  we have determined that we are in compliance with these financial covenants 
the credit facilities also contain a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants including limitations on mergers  consolidations and dissolutions  sales of assets  investments and acquisitions  indebtedness  liens  affiliate transactions  and dividends and restricted payments 
under the credit facilities  we are permitted maximum annual capital expenditures of up to million under the first lien credit facilities plus the lesser of a one year carry forward of the unused amount from the previous fiscal year and of the amount permitted for capital expenditures in the prior fiscal year 
our permitted maximum annual capital expenditures for is million 
the credit facilities contain events of default for non payment of principal and interest when due  a cross default provision with respect to other indebtedness having an aggregate principal amount of at least million and an 
table of contents event of default that would be triggered by a change of control  as defined in the credit facilities 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our covenants and other obligations under the credit facilities 
amendment agreements on december   we  through our subsidiary zionsolutions  entered into an agreement with exelon the zion agreement to dismantle exelon s zion nuclear facility located in zion  illinois zion station  which ceased operation in pursuant to the zion agreement  exelon has agreed to transfer to zionsolutions substantially all of the assets other than land associated with zion station  including assets held in nuclear decommissioning trusts 
in consideration for exelon s transfer of those assets  zionsolutions has agreed to assume decommissioning and other liabilities associated with the zion station 
zionsolutions also agreed to take possession and control of the land associated with the zion station pursuant to a lease agreement to be executed at the closing 
zionsolutions will be obligated to complete the required decommissioning work according to an established schedule and to construct a dry cask storage facility on the land for spent nuclear fuel currently held in spent fuel pools at the zion station 
the parties agreed to enter into various other agreements to ensure the performance of the obligations of zionsolutions under its contracts to complete the required decommissioning and other work 
in particular  we have agreed to execute a credit support agreement pursuant to which we will deliver a letter of credit in the face amount of million  which will be held by exelon 
the occurrence of specified events of default would allow exelon to draw upon the letter of credit 
in anticipation of the closing of this transaction  on july   we and our subsidiary  duratek  entered into amendment agreements with our lenders under the current credit facilities 
the amendment agreements provide that the existing credit agreements shall be amended and restated in their entirety upon satisfaction of certain conditions including the closing of the transaction with exelon 
the amended and restated credit facilities were sought a to allow us to provide for a new letter of credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of million the zion letter of credit facility pursuant to the zion agreement and b to return the existing synthetic letters of credit facility deposits and make term letter of credit facility loans in the aggregate principal amount of million for which we have agreed to maintain restricted cash equal to the amount of the facility 
the new term letter of credit facility and the restricted cash amount will be reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
the amendment agreements provide that the amended and restated credit facilities will include letter of credit fees of with respect to letters of credit issued under each of the revolving loan facility and the zion letter of credit facility 
in addition  the amendment agreements provide that the amended and restated credit facilities will provide for interest rates on loans as follows i with respect to any term loan  x libor plus or libor plus when the leverage ratio is less than to or y the base rate plus or the base rate plus when the leverage ratio is less than to  ii with respect to any revolving loan  x libor plus or y the base rate plus  and iii with respect to any term letter of credit facility loan  libor plus or libor plus when the leverage ratio is less than to 
the amendment agreements provide that the amended and restated credit facilities are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent to closing  including those related to approval for the transactions contemplated by the zion agreement 
during the year ended december   we have paid fees of approximately million to the lenders to obtain the amendment agreements  which are being amortized over the remaining term of the credit facilities 
in addition  once we have closed the zion agreement and the zion letter of credit is issued  we anticipate paying the providers of the zion letter of credit facility approximately million  which will be amortized over one year  which is the term of the zion letter of credit facility 

table of contents contractual obligations and other commitments as of december   our contractual obligations and other commitments were as follows payments due by period total and beyond in thousands of dollars long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations other contractual obligations total includes only obligations to pay principal 
assuming our variable interest rate of at december  remains constant during these periods  our interest payment obligations would be million  million and million for  and  respectively  for a total interest payment obligation of million 
off balance sheet arrangements we have routine operating leases  primarily related to real estate and rail equipment  and investments in joint ventures at december  as of december  we had outstanding floating rate term loans of million 
under our credit facilities  we are required to maintain one or more interest rate swap agreements for the aggregate notional amount of at least of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the term loans 
accordingly  we entered into a swap agreement effective december  as of december   the swap agreement had a notional amount of million and a fair value liability of approximately  we are required to post  from time to time  standby letters of credit and surety bonds to support contractual obligations to customers  self insurance programs  closure and post closure financial assurance and other obligations 
as of december  we had million in letters of credit issued under our synthetic letters of credit facilities and million in letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facilities 
as of december  we had million in surety bonds outstanding 
with respect to the surety bonds  we have entered into certain indemnification agreements with the providers of the surety bonds  which would require funding by us only if we fail to perform under the contracts being insured and the surety bond issuer was obligated to make payment to the insured parties 
our processing and disposal facilities operate under licenses and permits that require financial assurance for closure and post closure costs 
we provide for these requirements through a combination of restricted cash  cash deposits  letters of credit and insurance policies 
as of december  the closure and post closure state regulatory requirements for our facilities were million  which amount is not determined on the same basis as the asset retirement obligation  or aro  calculated under sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about matters that are uncertain 
these estimates and 
table of contents assumptions are often based on judgments that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  but all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions  and it is possible that other professionals  applying their own judgment to the same facts and circumstances  could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective estimates and assumptions 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
revenue recognition we record revenue when all of the following conditions exist evidence of an agreement with our customer  work has actually been performed  the amount of revenue can be reasonably estimated  and collection of revenue from our customer is reasonably assured 
federal  commercial and international contracts our services are provided under cost reimbursable award or incentive fee  fixed price and unit rate contracts 
the following describes our policies for these contract types cost reimbursable contracts we are reimbursed for allowable costs in accordance with federal acquisition regulations far  cost accounting standards cas  or contractual provisions 
if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or cas  we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for such costs 
a contract may also provide for award fees or incentive fees in addition to cost reimbursements 
incentive fees are earned if we meet certain contract provisions  including schedule  budget and safety 
monthly assessments are made to measure the amount of revenues earned in accordance with established contract provisions 
award and incentive fees are accrued when estimable and collection is reasonably assured 
fixed price contracts we receive a fixed amount of revenues irrespective of the actual costs we incur 
for fixed price contracts  our revenues are recognized using the proportional performance method of accounting using appropriate output measures  where estimable  or on other measures such as proportion of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs 
unit rate contracts for unit rate contracts  our revenues are recognized using the proportional performance method of accounting as units are completed based on contractual unit rates 
accounting for revenues earned under our contracts may require assessments that include an estimate of the amount that has been earned on the contract and are usually based on the volumes that have been processed or disposed  milestones reached or the time that has elapsed under the contract 
each of our contracts is unique with regard to scope  schedule and delivery methodology 
accordingly  each contract is reviewed to determine the most reliable measure of completion for revenue recognition purposes 
input measures such as costs incurred to total contract costs are used only when there are no quantifiable output measures available and represent a reasonable basis for determining the relative status of the project given that  on many contracts  costs are the basis for determining the overall contract value and timing 
certain of our fixed price contracts are for services that are non linear in nature  require complex  non repetitive tasks or involve a non time based scope of work 
in these contracts  the earnings process 
table of contents is not fulfilled upon the achievement of milestones  but rather over the life of the contract 
evaluation of the obligations and customer requirements on these contracts does not produce objective  quantifiable output measures that reflect the earnings process for revenue recognition 
therefore  in these situations  we use a cost to cost approach to determine revenues 
a cost to cost approach accurately reflects our obligations and performance on these contracts  as well as meeting the customers expectations of service being performed 
therefore  we believe that input measures used to measure progress toward completion on certain fixed price projects provide a reasonable surrogate as compared to using output measures 
for the years ended december   and  revenues calculated using a cost to cost approach were million  million and million  respectively 
revisions to revenues  cost and profit estimates  or measurements of the extent of progress toward completion are changes in accounting estimates accounted for in the period of change cumulative catch up method 
contracts typically provide for periodic billings on a monthly basis or based on contract milestones 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents amounts recognized as revenue that have not been billed 
unearned revenues represent amounts billed and collected for which revenues have not been recognized 
we record contract claims and pending change orders  including requests for equitable adjustments  or reas  when collection of revenues is reasonably assured  which generally is when accepted in writing by the customer 
the cost to perform the work related to these claims and pending change orders  including reas  is included in our financial statements in the period that they are incurred and are included in our estimates of contract profitability 
a provision for estimated losses on individual contracts is recognized in the period in which the losses are identified and includes all estimated direct costs to complete such contracts excluding future general and administrative costs expected to be allocated to the contracts 
monthly assessments are performed on our estimates and changes are made based on the latest information available 
lp d contracts our lp d services are provided primarily under unit rate contracts 
revenues are recognized as units of materials are processed or disposed based on the unit prices provided in the contracts 
d d liabilities we have responsibility for the cost to decontaminate and decommission our facilities and related equipment  as well as the equipment used at customer sites in the commercial services segment 
such costs will generally be paid upon closure of such facilities or disposal of such equipment 
we are also responsible for the cost of monitoring our clive  utah facility  over the post closure period 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires us to record the fair value of an aro as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal use of the asset 
we are also required to record a corresponding asset that we depreciate over the life of the asset 
after the initial measurement of the aro  the aro is adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
the cost basis for our landfill assets and related obligation include landfill liner material and installation  excavation for airspace  landfill leachate collection systems  environmental groundwater and air monitoring equipment  directly related engineering and design costs and other capital infrastructure costs 
also included in the cost basis of our landfill assets and related obligation are estimates of future 
table of contents costs associated with final landfill capping  closure and post closure monitoring activities 
these costs are described below final capping involves the installation of final cap materials over areas of the landfill where total airspace has been consumed 
we estimate available airspace capacity using aerial and ground surveys and other methods of calculation  based on permit mandated height restrictions and other factors 
final capping aros are recorded  with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset  as landfill airspace capacity is permitted for waste disposal activities and the cell liner is constructed 
final capping costs are recorded as an asset and a liability based on estimates of the discounted cash flows and capacity associated with the final capping event 
closure involves the remediation of our land surrounding the disposal cell and the disposal of company owned property and equipment 
these are costs incurred after the site ceases to accept waste  but before the site is certified to be closed by the applicable regulatory agency 
these costs are accrued as an aro  with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset  as airspace is consumed over the life of the landfill 
closure obligations are accrued over the life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with performing closure activities 
post closure involves the maintenance and monitoring of our landfill site that has been certified to be closed by the applicable regulatory agency 
subsequent to landfill closure  we are required to maintain and monitor our landfill site for a year period 
these maintenance and monitoring costs are accrued as an aro  with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset  as airspace is consumed over the life of the landfill 
post closure obligations are accrued over the life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with performing post closure activities 
the cost basis for our d d assets and related obligation include costs to decontaminate  disassemble and dispose of equipment and facilities 
we develop our estimates of these obligations using input from our operations personnel  engineers and accountants 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of current requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to approximate fair value under the provisions of sfas no 
we use historical experience  professional engineering judgment and quoted and actual prices paid for similar work to determine the fair value of these obligations 
we recognize these obligations at market prices whether we plan to contract with third parties or perform the work ourselves 
costs for the d d of our facilities and equipment will generally be paid upon the closure of these facilities or the disposal of this equipment 
we are obligated under our license granted by the state of south carolina and the atlantic interstate low level radioactive waste compact implementation act for costs associated with the ultimate closure of the barnwell low level radioactive waste disposal facility in south carolina and our buildings and equipment located at the barnwell site barnwell closure 
under the terms of the atlantic waste compact act and our license with the state of south carolina  we are required to maintain a trust fund to cover the barnwell closure obligation  which limits our obligation to the amount of the trust fund 
we are required to make significant estimates in the determination of our aros and the related assets 
pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 our cost estimates for final capping  closure and post closure activities and other d d activities are intended to approximate fair value and are based on our interpretation of the current regulatory requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes 
where applicable  these cost estimates are based on the amount a third party would charge to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally 
because final landfill capping  closure and post closure obligations and decontamination and decommissioning obligations are measured using present value techniques  changes in the estimated timing of the related activities would have an effect on these liabilities  related assets and resulting operations 

table of contents changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs  timing or extent of the required future capping  closure  post closure and other d d activities typically result in both i a current adjustment to the recorded liability and asset and ii a change in the liability and asset amounts to be recorded prospectively over the remaining life of the asset in accordance with our depreciation policy 
a hypothetical increase in the inflation rate would have increased our d d obligation by million 
a hypothetical increase in our cost estimate would have increased our d d obligation by million 
we update our d d and closure and post closure cost estimates either annually or more frequently if changes in the underlying conditions occur 
these estimates are based on current technology  regulations and burial rates 
changes in these factors could have a material impact on our estimates 
recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level at least annually for impairment and is reviewed for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires a two step impairment test 
in the first step  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow valuation model and compare the fair value to the reporting unit s carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the fair value does not exceed the carrying value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
in the second step of the goodwill impairment test  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying value 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
we estimate future cash flows at the reporting unit level using a discounted cash flow methodology by assessing each major existing contract and projecting the earnings that will be recognized in future periods 
estimates are also made for earnings from new contracts that are anticipated based on our evaluation of future business prospects 
the valuation of goodwill could be affected if actual results differ substantially from our estimates 
circumstances that could affect the valuation of goodwill include a significant change in our business climate  decisions by our customers to terminate our existing contracts and decisions by our customers to award to our competitors new contracts that we anticipated would be awarded to us 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition 
we assess the useful lives of other intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
since our annual impairment test  which was completed in the second quarter of  we have updated our forecasts to reflect the impacts of the global economic down turn and have determined that goodwill is not impaired as of december  however  further changes in our forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operating segments to exceed their fair values  which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
as of december  and  respectively  we had million and million of goodwill and 
table of contents million and million of intangible assets with estimable useful lives on our consolidated balance sheet 
we do not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
intangible assets subject to amortization consist of customer relationships  licenses and permits  technology and non compete agreements 
customer relationships  which include the fair value of acquired customer contracts  were evaluated for each operating segment using a discounted cash flow methodology and are amortized on a straight line basis over a term of to years 
estimated future cash flows for each operating segment were derived based on detailed budgets and projections prepared by management 
licenses and permits were evaluated for each licensed facility using a replacement cost methodology 
also  due to the unique characteristics of the envirocare permits we also included an opportunity cost reflecting an estimate of earnings that would be lost if we had to replace the licenses and permits as opposed to having acquired them 
licenses and permits are either amortized over the definite terms of the related agreements or over the remaining useful lives of the related intangible asset  typically to years 
estimates of replacement cost were determined by management taking into consideration the cost of labor and other costs needed to meet regulatory requirements to obtain and maintain the license or permit 
estimates of opportunity cost were determined by management after considering estimated cash flows for the business generated with the licenses and permits offset by contribution asset charges for other assets of the business that also contribute to cash flow generation 
technology and non compete agreements were evaluated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
intangible technology assets are amortized on a straight line basis over a term of to years and non compete agreements are amortized over the terms of the contracts 
estimated future cash flows for each technology and non compete agreement were derived based on detailed budgets and projections prepared by management 
long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount of excess carrying value over fair value 
equity based compensation expense pursuant to sfas no 
r  share based payment fas r  we account for equity based compensation payments  including grants of employee stock options  based on the fair values of the equity instruments issued 
fair value of equity instruments issued in connection with our initial public offering were determined based on an option pricing model which takes into account various assumptions that are subjective 
key assumptions used in the valuation included the expected term of the equity award taking into account both the contractual term of the award  the effects of employees expected exercise and post vesting termination behavior  expected volatility  expected dividends and the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the award 
in and  certain members of senior management were granted profit interest units in env holdings llc  in consideration for services rendered to us 
these units entitle the holders to distributions from env holdings 
certain units vested immediately upon grant and others vest over periods up to three years 
these profit interest units are not convertible into common stock of energysolutions  inc or any other equity security of energysolutions  inc however  because these grants of profit interest units were made for services rendered to us  we recorded compensation expenses in connection with these grants 
the grant date fair value of these units was determined using both a market approach and an income or discounted cash flow approach 
as part of the market approach  we used both comparable public companies market multiples approach and comparable transactions in order to estimate 
table of contents enterprise value 
the income or discounted cash flow approach used management s assumptions for growth in our revenues and expenses to estimate enterprise value 
the resulting enterprise values as calculated under each approach were then averaged using an equal weighting to arrive at the final enterprise value 
this value was then allocated to each class of profit interest units based on each class s priority of distributions 
we recorded compensation expense of  million and million for the years ended december   and  which represents the vested portion of the fair value of these units 
we anticipate that the equity based compensation expense related to the vesting of these units will be approximately  in in addition  we have options outstanding to purchase an aggregate of  shares and  unvested restricted shares as of december  under the measurement principles of fas r  we estimate that we will recognize compensation expense related to the issuance of these awards of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our estimate of fair value for the stock options was made using the black scholes model based upon the closing stock price on the date of grant  volatility of  risk free interest rate of to per year  expected life of years to years  and a dividend yield of to 
we determined the volatility rate by reference to volatility rates used by certain of our public industry peers since we do not have an established trading history of our common stock 
we determined the expected life by using the short cut method  as permitted by sec staff accounting bulletin no

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk relates to changing interest rates 
as of december   we had outstanding floating rate term loan debt of million  of which million is currently due within the next year 
under our credit facilities  we are required to maintain one or more interest rate swap agreements for the aggregate notional amount of at least of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the term loans 
as of december   our swap agreement had a notional amount of million and a fair value liability of approximately  for further information on the swap agreement  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
a hypothetical interest rate change of on our credit facilities would have changed interest expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
in addition  a hypothetical interest rate change of on our swap agreement would have changed the fair value of the interest swap at december  by approximately million 
changes in market interest rates would impact the fair value of our long term obligations 
as of december  we had outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities of million with an approximate fair value of million 
prior to our acquisition of rsmc  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations was immaterial 
through rsmc  we earn fee income denominated in british pounds sterling 
we have foreign currency exposure related to our operations in the united kingdom as well as other foreign locations 
this foreign currency exposure arises primarily from the translation or re measurement of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars 
for example  a substantial portion of our annual sales and operating costs are denominated in pound sterling and we have exposure related to sales and operating costs increasing or decreasing based on changes in currency exchange rates 
if the us dollar increases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies have a direct impact on the value in us dollars of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of this exchange rate risk by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions pursuant to our policies 
as such  a change in the us dollar exchange rates in effect as of december   would cause a change in consolidated net assets of approximately million and a change in gross profit of approximately million  primarily due to pound sterling denominated exposures
