we present ebitda to enhance the understanding of our operating results 
ebitda is a key measure we use to evaluate our operations 
we provide our ebitda because we believe that investors and securities analysts will find ebitda to be a useful measure for evaluating our operating performance and comparing our operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and for evaluating our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
however  ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this financial review presents our operating results for each of our three most recent fiscal years and our financial condition at december  except for historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we discuss such risks  uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under item a of part i of this report  risk factors 
in addition  the following review should be read in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a one stop provider of time critical and technologically complex printed circuit boards pcbs and backplane assemblies  which serve as the foundation of sophisticated electronic products 
we serve high end commercial and aerospace defense markets including the networking communications infrastructure  defense  high end computing  and industrial medical markets which are characterized by high levels of complexity and moderate production volumes 
our customers include original equipment manufacturers oems  electronic manufacturing services ems providers  and aerospace defense companies 
our time to market and high technology focused manufacturing services enable our customers to reduce the time required to develop new products and bring them to market 
in  we completed the acquisition of the tyco printed circuit group business from tyco international ltd 
the total purchase price of the acquisition was million  excluding acquisition costs 
this acquisition enhanced our business in the following ways positioned us as the largest pcb fabricator in north america as well as the largest pcb fabricator in the aerospace defense end market  expanded and diversified our customer base  added complementary commercial pcb fabrication facilities to our historic three commercial pcb manufacturing sites  added global backplane and sub system assembly capability  entered the backplane assembly market in china with a facility in shanghai  and expanded our engineering and materials expertise 
we measure customers as those companies that have placed at least two orders in the preceding month period 
as of december   we had approximately customers and approximately as of december  sales to our largest customers accounted for and of our net sales in and  respectively 
we sell to oems both directly and indirectly through ems companies 
sales attributable to our five largest oem customers accounted for approximately and of our net sales in and  respectively 
the following table shows the percentage of our net sales attributable to each of the principal end markets we served for the periods indicated 
year ended december  end markets networking communications aerospace defense computing storage peripherals medical industrial instrumentation other total sales to ems companies are classified by the end markets of their oem customers 

table of contents for pcbs we measure the time sensitivity of our products by tracking the quick turn percentage of our work 
we define quick turn orders as those with delivery times of days or less  which typically captures research and development  prototype  and new product introduction work  in addition to unexpected short term demand among our customers 
generally  we quote prices after we receive the design specifications and the time and volume requirements from our customers 
our quick turn services command a premium price as compared to standard lead time products 
quick turn orders decreased from approximately of pcb revenue in to of pcb revenue in due to higher demand for our standard lead time and high technology production services 
we also deliver a large percentage of compressed lead time work with lead times of to days 
we receive a premium price for this work as well 
purchase orders may be cancelled prior to shipment 
we charge customers a fee  based on percentage completed  if an order is cancelled once it has entered production 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies using customer supplied engineering and design plans 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed and determinable  title and risk of loss have transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
net sales consist of gross sales less an allowance for returns  which typically has been less than of gross sales 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies 
we record an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on historical information 
cost of goods sold consists of materials  labor  outside services  and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture and testing of our products as well as stock based compensation expense 
many factors affect our gross margin  including capacity utilization  product mix  production volume  and yield 
we do not participate in any significant long term contracts with suppliers  and we believe there are a number of potential suppliers for the raw materials we use 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our internal sales force and independent sales representatives  salaries paid to our sales support staff  stock based compensation expense as well as costs associated with marketing materials and trade shows 
we generally pay higher commissions to our independent sales representatives for quick turn work  which generally has a higher gross profit component than standard lead time work 
general and administrative costs primarily include the salaries for executive  finance  accounting  information technology  facilities and human resources personnel  as well as insurance expenses  expenses for accounting and legal assistance  incentive compensation expense  stock based compensation expense  and bad debt expense 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies for which significant judgments and estimates are made include asset valuation related to bad debts and inventory obsolescence  sales returns and allowances  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  realizability of deferred tax assets  and determining stock based compensation expense  self insured reserves  asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities 
a detailed description of these estimates and our policies to account for them is included in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we provide customary credit terms to our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collections experience and expected collectibility of accounts 
our actual bad debts may differ from our estimates 
inventories in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with current and committed inventory levels 
provision is made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
our inventory requirements may change based on our projected customer demand  changes due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
we maintain certain finished goods inventories near certain key customer locations in accordance with agreements with those customers 
although this inventory is typically supported by valid purchase orders  should these customers ultimately not purchase these inventories  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the sale of printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies using customer supplied engineering and design plans and recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed and determinable  title and risk of loss have transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies 
we accrue an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on historical information 
to the extent actual experience varies from our historical experience  revisions to these allowances may be required 
long lived assets we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets consisting of property  plant and equipment  assets held for sale  definite lived intangibles  and goodwill 
we review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform an impairment test related to goodwill at least annually 
our goodwill and intangibles are largely attributable to our acquisitions of other businesses 
we have two reporting units  which are also our operating segments  and both contained goodwill prior to our annual impairment testing 
during the fourth quarter  we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill  which requires the use of a fair value based analysis 
we determined the fair value of our operating segments based on discounted cash flows and market approach analyses and considered factors such as a weakening economy  reduced expectations for future cash flows coupled with a decline in the market price of our stock and market capitalization for a sustained period  as indicators for potential goodwill impairment 
in conjunction with our annual assessment of goodwill  we also assessed other long lived assets  specifically definite lived intangibles and property  plant and equipment  for potential impairment given similar impairment indicators 
the completion of our impairment assessment determined that the carrying value of our goodwill and certain long lived assets at production facilities exceeded their fair value 
as a result  a charge of million and million were recorded for the impairment of goodwill and of long lived assets  respectively  as of december  we use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows in measuring whether our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are recoverable 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our goodwill and other long lived assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes deferred income tax assets are reviewed for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
at december   we have net deferred income tax assets of million and no valuation allowance 
should our expectations of taxable income 
table of contents change in future periods  it may be necessary to establish a valuation allowance  which could affect our results of operations in the period such a determination is made 
in addition  we record income tax provision or benefit during interim periods at a rate that is based on expected results for the full year 
if we reestablish a valuation allowance subsequent to december   and then determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred income tax assets would be realizable in an amount greater than what already is recorded  we would reverse all or a portion of valuation allowance in the period the determination is made 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  adjustments to the effective income tax rate could be required 
share based awards effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments  sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted on and after january   and prior but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award using a straight line method 
we estimate the value of share based restricted stock unit awards on the date of grant using the closing share price 
we estimate the value of share based option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
calculating the fair value of share based option payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the share based payment awards and expected stock price volatility 
the expected term represents the average time that options that vest are expected to be outstanding 
the expected volatility rates are estimated based on a weighted average of the historical volatilities of our common stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we have currently estimated our forfeiture rate to be 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
for the year ended december   share based compensation expense was million 
at december   total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non vested stock options was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
at december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
self insurance we are self insured for group health insurance and worker s compensation benefits provided to our employees  and we purchase insurance to protect against claims at the individual and aggregate level 
the insurance carrier adjudicates and processes employee claims and is paid a fee for these services 
we reimburse our insurance carriers for paid claims subject to variable monthly limitations 
we estimate our exposure for claims incurred but not paid at the end of each reporting period and use historical information supplied by our insurance carriers and brokers on an annual basis to estimate our liability for these claims 
this liability is subject to an aggregate stop loss that ranges between  and  per individual 
our actual claims experience may differ from our estimates 
asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities we establish liabilities for the costs of asset retirement obligations when a legal or contractual obligation exists to dispose of or restore an asset upon its retirement and the timing and cost of such work can be reasonably estimated 
we record such liabilities only when such timing and costs are reasonably determinable 
in addition  we accrue an estimate of the costs of environmental remediation for work at identified sites where an assessment has indicated it is probable that cleanup costs are or will be required and may be reasonably estimated 
in making these estimates  we consider information that is currently available  existing technology  enacted laws and regulations  and our estimates of the timing of the required remedial actions  and we discount these estimates at 
we also are required to estimate the amount of any probable recoveries  including insurance recoveries 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the relationship of various items to net sales in our consolidated statement of operations year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of definite lived intangibles impairment of goodwill and long lived assets metal reclamation restructuring charges total operating expenses operating loss income other income expense interest expense interest income other  net total other expense income  net loss income before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss income we have two reportable segments pcb manufacturing and backplane assembly 
these reportable segments are managed separately because they distribute and manufacture distinct products with different production processes 
pcb manufacturing fabricates printed circuit boards 
backplane assembly is a contract manufacturing business that specializes in assembling backplanes into sub assemblies and other complete electronic devices 
pcb manufacturing customers are either ems companies or oem companies  while backplane assembly customers are usually oems 
our backplane assembly segment includes our hayward  california and shanghai  china plants and our ireland sales and distribution infrastructure 
our pcb manufacturing segment is comprised of eight domestic pcb fabrication plants  and a facility that provides follow on value added services primarily for one of the pcb manufacturing plants 
the following table compares net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands net sales pcb manufacturing backplane assembly total sales inter company sales total net sales 
table of contents the years ended december  and include a full year of results of operations from pcg facilities compared to only days for the year ended december  as the acquisition of tyco printed circuit group occurred on october  net sales net sales increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this revenue increase is substantially due to increased demand from aerospace defense customers and higher pricing from the pcb manufacturing segment  while backplane assembly segment sales remained relatively consistent with this revenue increase was achieved in spite of the closure of our dallas  oregon facility in april the dallas  oregon facility contributed approximately million of revenue to the pcb manufacturing segment during excluding revenue derived from our dallas  oregon facility  revenue from the pcb manufacturing segment in improved by million from due to increased net sales at our other pcb manufacturing facilities 
pcb sales volume  measured by panels shipped  decreased approximately for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended prices rose approximately due to a shift in production mix toward more high technology production 
our quick turn production  which we measure as orders placed and shipped within days  decreased from of pcb revenue for the year ended december  to of pcb revenue for the year ended december  the increasingly complex nature of our quick turn work requires more time to manufacture  thereby extending some of these orders beyond the day delivery window 
net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in due to several factors  including the addition of a full year of results from the acquired pcg facilities and higher pricing 
the increase in net sales reflects an increase of million from our pcg facilities  and an increase of million from our historical operations  partially offset by a million increase in inter company sales 
the backplane assembly segment accounted for million of this net sales increase  and the pcg facilities in our pcb manufacturing segment accounted for the remaining million 
pcb sales volume  measured by panels shipped  increased approximately due to the inclusion of a full year of the pcg operations 
pricing increased approximately primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of results from the pcg facilities  which tend to have higher average pricing 
the increase in pricing was driven equally by increases in quick turn and standard product pricing 
our quick turn production  which generally is characterized by higher prices  decreased from of pcb revenue in to of pcb revenue in due to both higher demand for our standard lead time  high technology production services as well as the full year inclusion of results from the pcg facilities  which focus primarily on standard lead time services 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  cost of goods sold increased mainly due to increased sales but was also impacted by increased labor and overhead costs 
for the year ended december   cost of goods sold  as a percentage of sales  decreased to from for the year ended december   primarily due to a shift in production mix toward more high technology production and higher pricing 
cost of goods sold increased million  or  from million for to million for cost of goods sold rose due to several factors  including the addition of a full year of results for the pcg facilities  especially from the backplane assembly operations  which have inherently higher cost content and lower margins 
likewise  higher material prices contributed to the increase in cost of goods sold from to cost of goods sold in included million of manufacturing profit added to pcg inventories at the acquisition date  which was expensed during a similar adjustment increased cost of goods sold for by million 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased from for to for gross profit gross profit increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  with gross margin increasing from for the year ended 
table of contents december  to for the year ended december  the change in our gross margin for was primarily due to a shift in production mix toward more high technology production and higher pricing 
gross profit increased million  or  from million for to million for our gross margin decreased from in to in the decrease in our gross margin was largely due to inclusion of a full year of results from our backplane assembly operations  which have inherently lower gross margins 
additionally  slightly lower volume at our pcb manufacturing operations reduced absorption of fixed costs at some of our plants  further reducing gross margin 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase for the year ended is primarily due to increased labor expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses increased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the components of selling and marketing expenses as a percent of net sales did not change significantly from to selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  from million for to million for  due to inclusion of a full year of results of the pcg facilities in as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses decreased slightly from in to in the components of selling and marketing expenses as a percent of net sales did not change significantly from to general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in expenses resulted primarily from higher incentive bonus expense and stock based compensation expense for restricted stock unit and stock option awards  partially offset by lower accounting and consulting expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for to million  or of net sales  for the increase in expenses resulted primarily from the inclusion of the pcg facilities in our results for the full year of other factors that increased general and administrative expense were higher stock based compensation expense from a greater number of employees participating in our equity award program as well as increased accounting  legal and consulting expenses related to integration of the acquisition as well as bringing the newly acquired pcg facilities into compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to greater absorption of these costs over a larger revenue base 
amortization of definite lived intangibles amortization expense related to definite lived intangibles decreased million to million in compared to million in amortization expense related to definite lived intangibles increased million to million in compared to million in the decrease in amortization expense for as compared to is primarily due to the gradual decline in strategic customer relationship intangibles related to the pcg acquisition in october the prior increase in amortization expense for as compared to is primarily due to the increase in strategic customer relationship intangibles related to the pcg acquisition in october impairment of goodwill and long lived assets during the fourth quarter of  we recorded impairment charges of million  consisting of a goodwill impairment of million and a long lived asset impairment of million 
as a result of our annual goodwill impairment testing  giving consideration to factors such as a weakening economy  reduced expectation for future cash flows coupled with the decline in the market price of our stock and market capitalization for a sustained period  
table of contents as indicators for potential goodwill impairment  we determined that the carrying value of our pcb manufacturing segment s goodwill exceeded its implied fair value  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
we also completed an assessment of our long lived assets  including assets held for sale  and recorded a million asset impairment charge related to our oregon  washington  and hayward  california production facilities 
our oregon facility has been classified as held for sale since june  we continue to actively market this facility at a price that is indicative of the facility s intent and ability to sell 
an impairment was also recorded for our hayward facility  which is part of our backplane assembly segment  as it is expected to produce slower growth and lower future production 
finally  as a result of our january  announcement of our plan to close the washington production facility  we determined that specific long lived assets at this production facility were impaired 
the washington production facility is part of the pcb manufacturing operating segment 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our goodwill and other long lived assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
metal reclamation during the first quarter of  we recognized million of income related to a pricing reconciliation of metal reclamation activity attributable to a single vendor 
as a result of the pricing reconciliation  we discovered that the vendor had inaccurately compensated us for gold reclamations over the last several years 
while pricing reconciliations of this nature occur periodically  we do not expect to recognize a similar amount in future periods 
restructuring charges in the fourth fiscal quarter  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to realigning certain sales and administrative functions 
other income expense other expense decreased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the net decrease consists of a million decrease in interest expense  offset by a million increase in other  net 
interest expense of million for includes debt service interest costs and the amortization of related debt issuance costs 
debt service interest and related debt issuance costs for decreased by million and million  respectively  as compared to  resulting from a combination of overall lower outstanding debt balances under our credit agreement with ubs securities in  our repayment in full of the credit agreement in may and a lower interest rate on our outstanding convertible notes due may  convertible notes issued in may this decrease was offset by the increase in other  net expense of million primarily related to the realized loss on the settlement of a derivative of million during the quarter ended june  associated with the repayment in full of the credit agreement  the million estimated loss on a money market fund that suspended redemptions and is being liquidated and other of million 
other income expense declined million from income of million in to expense of million in this net decrease resulted from an increase of million in interest expense and the accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs related to our million senior secured term loan used to fund the acquisition of pcg  and a decrease of million in interest income primarily from interest earned on lower balances of cash and cash equivalents 
income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased million from a million tax provision for the year ended december  to a million tax benefit for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was in and for the decrease in the provision is due to the decrease in pretax income 
the increase in our effective tax rate is due to the addition of state tax credits and the decrease in production activities deductions 
our effective tax rate is primarily impacted by the federal income tax rate  apportioned state income tax 
table of contents rates  utilization of other credits and deductions available to us  and certain non deductible items 
additionally  as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
based on our forecast for future taxable earnings  we believe we will utilize the deferred tax asset in future periods 
the provision for income taxes decreased from million for to million for the decrease in income tax provision from to resulted from the release of the valuation allowance of million to reflect our ability to utilize state tax credit carryforwards  lower pretax income in  and a lower effective tax rate for our effective tax rate was in and our effective tax rate was in excluding the favorable impacts to our tax provision resulting from the decreases in our valuation allowance in  our effective tax rate in was 
our effective tax rate is primarily impacted by the federal income tax rate  apportioned state income tax rates  utilization of other credits and deductions available to us  and certain non deductible items 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  the issuance of convertible notes  and exercises of employee stock options 
our principal uses of cash have been to meet debt service requirements  finance capital expenditures  and fund working capital requirements 
we anticipate that servicing debt  funding working capital requirements  financing capital expenditures  and potential acquisitions will continue to be the principal demands on our cash in the future 
as of december   we had net working capital of approximately million  compared to million as of december  the increase in working capital is primarily attributable to the growth in cash balances resulting from the convertible notes offering during the second quarter of our capital expenditure plan is expected to total approximately million and will fund capital equipment purchases to expand our technological capabilities throughout our facilities and replace aging equipment 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in our operating cash flow of million reflects a net loss of million  million of an impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation  and million other  offset by an increase in net deferred income tax assets of million and a net increase in working capital of million 
our operating cash flow of million  which significantly benefited from the acquisition of pcg  primarily reflects net income of million  million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation  a decrease in net deferred income tax assets of million  and a net decrease in working capital of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in and million in in  we made net purchases of approximately million of property  plant  and equipment  redesignated million from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments and received million in proceeds from the redemption of short term investments 
at december   the fair value of our investment in the reserve primary fund  a money market fund that has suspended redemptions and is being liquidated  was million 
we have requested redemption of our investment in the reserve primary fund and expect distribution to occur as the reserve primary fund s assets mature or are sold 
we have received total distributions of million  of which million was received during the fourth quarter and million was received during the first quarter we expect to receive substantially all of our current holdings in the reserve primary fund 
in  we made net purchases of approximately million of property  plant  and equipment  offset by proceeds of million from the redemption of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to cash used of million in and cash provided of million in our financing net cash proceeds primarily reflect cash proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes of million  proceeds from warrants of million and exercises of employee stock options of million  partially offset by debt repayment of million  payment for the convertible note hedge of million and debt issuance costs of million 
our financing net cash used reflects repayments of million of debt  partially offset by proceeds of million from employee stock option exercises and million from other factors 

table of contents in may  we issued our convertible notes in a public offering with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum 
interest is payable semiannually in arrears on may and november of each year  beginning november  the convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally to our future unsecured senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness 
we received proceeds of million after the deduction of offering expenses of million 
these offering expenses are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the convertible notes 
at any time prior to november   holders may convert their convertible notes into cash and  if applicable  into shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of convertible notes  subject to adjustment  under the following circumstances during any calendar quarter beginning after june  and only during such calendar quarter  if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days during the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day of such preceding calendar quarter  during the five business day period after any consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note for each day of that consecutive trading day period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on such day  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described in the prospectus supplement related to the convertible notes  which can be found on the sec s website at www 
sec 
gov 
as of december   none of the conversion criteria had been met 
on or after november  until the close of business on the third scheduled trading day preceding the maturity date  holders may convert their notes at any time  regardless of the foregoing circumstances 
upon conversion  for each  principal amount of notes  we will pay cash for the lesser of the conversion value or  and shares of our common stock  if any  based on a daily conversion value calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the trading day observation period 
additionally  in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the prospectus supplement  or other conversion rate adjustments such as share splits or combinations  other distributions of shares  cash or other assets to stockholders  including self tender transactions other conversion rate adjustments  the conversion rate may be modified to adjust the number of shares per  principal amount of the notes 
the maximum number of shares issuable upon conversion  including the effect of a fundamental change and subject to other conversion rate adjustments  would be approximately million shares 
we are not permitted to redeem the notes at any time prior to maturity 
in the event of a fundamental change or certain default events  as defined in the prospectus supplement  prior to november   holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into a convertible note hedge and warrant transaction call spread transaction  with respect to our common stock 
the convertible note hedge  which cost an aggregate million and was recorded  net of tax  as a reduction of additional paid in capital  consists of our option to purchase up to million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
this option expires on may  and can only be executed upon the conversion of the convertible notes 
additionally  we sold warrants for the option to purchase million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the warrants expire on august  the proceeds from the sale of warrants of million was recorded as an addition to additional paid in capital 
the call spread transaction has no effect on the terms of the convertible notes and reduces potential dilution by effectively increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes to per share of our common stock 
as of december   we had two outstanding standby letters of credit a million standby letter of credit expiring may  related to the lease of one of our production facilities and a million standby letter of credit expiring december  associated with our workers compensation insurance program 
on january   we announced a plan to close our redmond  washington facility and lay off approximately employees at this site 
in addition  we laid off about employees at various other 
table of contents us facilities 
as a result  we expect to record approximately million in separation and other exit costs related to this restructuring primarily in the first quarter of in addition to transferring assets to other sites  we also expect to sell some of the redmond property  plant and equipment 
the plant closure and headcount reductions are primarily due to the global economic downturn  which has weakened demand for commercial pcbs 
in connection with the pcg acquisition  we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation at two connecticut sites and are obligated to investigate a third connecticut site 
we currently estimate that we will incur remediation costs of million to million over the next to months related to these matters 
in addition  we have obligations to the connecticut dep to make certain environmental asset improvements to the waste water treatment systems in two connecticut plants 
these costs are estimated to be million and have been considered in our capital expenditure plan for lastly  we are required to maintain a compliance management plan through july under a compliance agreement with the us epa that we assumed from tyco 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash generated from operations  available cash and the proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes will be adequate to meet our currently anticipated debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital needs for the next months and beyond 
our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond the next months are to meet debt service requirements as well as for other contractual obligations as indicated in our contractual obligations table below and for capital purchases under our annual capital expenditure plan

environmental liabilities of million  not included in the table above  are accrued and recorded as long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  or have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not dependent upon moderate changes in the inflation rate as we expect that we generally will be able to continue to pass along component price increases to our customers

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our interest income is more sensitive to fluctuation in the general level of us interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
our outstanding debt bears a fixed interest rate and therefore is not subject to the effects of interest rate fluctuation 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the us dollar as a normal part of the reporting process 
our chinese operations utilize the chinese yuan or rmb as the functional currency  which results in our recording a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within our statement of stockholders equity 
net foreign currency transaction gains or losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar were million loss  million gain and million loss during the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
we currently do not utilize any derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risks
