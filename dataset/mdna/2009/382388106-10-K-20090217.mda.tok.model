our former goodrich aviation technical services  inc 
ats business has been accounted for as a discontinued operation 
unless otherwise noted herein  disclosures pertain only to our continuing operations 
overview we are one of the largest worldwide suppliers of aerospace components  systems and services to the commercial and general aviation airplane markets 
we are also a leading supplier of systems and products to the global defense and space markets 
our business is conducted globally with manufacturing  service and sales undertaken in various locations throughout the world 
our products and services are principally sold to customers in north america  europe and asia 
key market channels for products and services  growth drivers and industry and our highlights we participate in three key market channels commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane original equipment oe  commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane aftermarket  and defense and space 
commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane oe commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane oe includes sales of products and services for new airplanes produced by airbus and boeing  and regional  business and small airplane manufacturers 
the key growth drivers in this market channel include the number of orders for new airplanes  which will be delivered to the manufacturers customers over a period of several years  oe manufacturer production and delivery rates and introductions of new airplane models such as the boeing and  the airbus a and a xwb  the embraer  and engine types such as the pratt and whitney geared turbofan engine 
we have significant sales content on most of the airplanes manufactured in this market channel 
we have benefited from increased production rates and deliveries of airbus and boeing airplanes and from our substantial content on many of the regional and general aviation airplanes 
delivery of new commercial  regional  business  and general aviation aircraft in and beyond may be negatively impacted by the current economic conditions which may influence customers willingness and or ability to purchase new aircraft 
while the commercial airline industry was negatively impacted during by the increase in fuel prices and economic conditions worldwide  the commercial airplane manufacturers still have a significant backlog of orders 
airlines worldwide are expected to continue to take delivery of a significant number of new airplanes in and beyond to replace older aircraft and for additional capacity 
in december  we completed the formation of a joint venture with rolls royce group plc r r  which will develop and supply engine controls for r r aero engines 
the joint venture combined our existing uk based engine controls oe design and manufacturing business with 
table of contents r r s expertise in the integration of controls into the engine 
we will retain the aftermarket products and services business associated with the joint venture s products 
see note  investment in joint venture to our consolidated financial statements 
commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane aftermarket the commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane aftermarket channel includes sales of products and services for existing commercial and general aviation airplanes  primarily to airlines and package carriers around the world 
the key growth drivers in this channel include worldwide passenger capacity growth measured by available seat miles asm and the size  type and activity levels of the worldwide airplane fleet 
other important factors affecting growth in this market channel are the age and types of the airplanes in the fleet  fuel prices and gross domestic product gdp trends in countries and regions around the world 
capacity in the global airline system  as measured by asms  is expected to decrease by about annually in however  asm growth could deteriorate further if airlines choose to fly their in service airplanes less frequently due to high fuel prices  decreased demand and other factors 
while we have significant product content on most of the airplane models that are currently in service  we enjoy the benefit of having excellent positions on the newer  more fuel efficient airplanes currently in service 
even though many airlines have announced that they will remove some of their older airplanes from their fleets  we do not expect these removals to have a significant impact on our results in these older airplanes  primarily md s and classics  represent approximately of the world s fleet of large commercial aircraft  but only of our large commercial aftermarket sales  or about of our total sales 
defense and space worldwide defense and space sales include sales to prime contractors such as boeing  northrop grumman  lockheed martin  the us government and foreign companies and governments 
the key growth drivers in this channel include the level of defense spending by the us and foreign governments  the number of new platform starts  the level of military flight operations and the level of upgrade  overhaul and maintenance activities associated with existing platforms 
the market for our defense and space products is global  and is not dependent on any single program  platform or customer 
we anticipate fewer new fighter and transport aircraft platform starts over the next several years 
we also anticipate that the introduction of the f lightning ii and new helicopter platforms  along with upgrades on existing defense and space platforms  will provide long term growth opportunities in this market channel 
additionally  we are participating in  and developing new products for  the rapidly expanding homeland security and intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance sectors  which should further strengthen our position in this market channel 
long term sustainable growth we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow overall sales over the long term due to awards for key products on important new and expected programs  including the airbus a and a xwb  the boeing and  the embraer  the pratt whitney geared turbofan engine  the dassault falcon x and the lockheed martin f lightning ii and f raptor  
table of contents growing commercial airplane fleet and strong positions on newer  more fuel efficient airplanes  which should fuel sustained aftermarket strength  balance in the large commercial airplane market  with strong sales to both airbus and boeing  aging of the existing large commercial and regional airplane fleets  which should result in increased aftermarket support  increased number of long term agreements for product sales on new and existing commercial airplanes  increased opportunities for aftermarket growth due to airline outsourcing  growth in global maintenance  repair and overhaul mro opportunities for our systems and components  particularly in europe  asia and the middle east  where we have expanded our capacity  and expansion of our product offerings in support of high growth areas in the defense and space market channel  such as helicopter products and systems and intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance products

net cash provided by discontinued operations of million in primarily consisted of cash flow provided by the operations of ats and insurance settlements with several insurers relating to the recovery of environmental remediation costs at a former plant previously recorded as a discontinued operation 
contingencies general there are various pending or threatened claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings against us or our subsidiaries  arising in the ordinary course of business  which seek remedies or damages 
although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of these matters  we believe that any liability that may finally be determined with respect to commercial and non asbestos product liability claims should not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
legal costs are expensed when incurred 
environmental we are subject to environmental laws and regulations which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations 
at certain sites we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 
estimates of our environmental liabilities are based on current facts  laws  regulations and technology 
these estimates take into consideration our prior experience and professional judgment of our environmental specialists 
estimates of our environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination  the range of remediation alternatives available  evolving remediation standards  imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates  the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties  as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 
accordingly  as investigation and remediation proceed  it is likely that adjustments in our accruals will be necessary to reflect new information 
the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a given period 
based on currently available information  however  we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable  which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when we have recommended a remedy or have committed to an appropriate plan of action 
the liabilities are reviewed periodically and  as investigation and remediation proceed  adjustments are made as necessary 
liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value 
the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties  but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar state managed sites  third party indemnity obligations  and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 
our consolidated balance sheet included an accrued liability for environmental remediation obligations of million and million at december  and  respectively 
at 
table of contents december  and  million and million  respectively  of the accrued liability for environmental remediation were included in current liabilities as accrued expenses 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was associated with ongoing operations and million and million  respectively  was associated with previously owned businesses 
we expect that we will expend present accruals over many years  and will generally complete remediation in less than years at sites for which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party 
this period includes operation and monitoring costs that are generally incurred over to years 
certain states in the us and countries globally are promulgating or proposing new or more demanding regulations or legislation impacting the use of various chemical substances by all companies 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of complying with such regulations and legislation 
on january   we received a judgment against commercial union insurance company  currently known as one beacon america insurance company  and nine london market insurance companies for reimbursement of past remediation costs at an environmental site  attorney fees and interest in the amount of approximately million and coverage of certain unquantified future costs 
on june   the ohio court of appeals upheld the judgment 
on december   the ohio supreme court denied the insurers request for further appeal 
on january   the insurers sought rehearing in the ohio supreme court 
execution on the judgment was stayed by the filing of a bond in the amount of million 
interest continues to accrue on portions of the judgment 
when the appeal is concluded  if the judgment is upheld  amounts received by us will be reflected in earnings and cash flows for the applicable period 
a former subsidiary of ours has a claim to a portion of the judgment amount 
due to the current status of the claim and the fact that a former subsidiary has a claim to a portion of any amounts realized  no amounts have been recorded in our financial statements as of december  asbestos we and some of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various actions by plaintiffs alleging damages as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers in products or at our facilities 
a number of these cases involve maritime claims  which have been and are expected to continue to be administratively dismissed by the court 
we believe that pending and reasonably anticipated future actions are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
there can be no assurance  however  that future legislative or other developments will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a given period 
insurance coverage we maintain a comprehensive portfolio of insurance policies  including aviation products liability insurance which covers most of our products 
the aviation products liability insurance provides first dollar coverage for defense and indemnity of third party claims 
a portion of our historical primary and excess layers of pre insurance coverage for third party claims was provided by certain insurance carriers who are either insolvent  undergoing solvent schemes of arrangement or in run off 
we have entered into settlement agreements with a number of these insurers pursuant to which we agreed to give up our rights with respect to certain insurance policies in exchange for negotiated payments 
these settlements represent negotiated payments for our loss of this pre insurance coverage  as we no longer have this insurance available for claims that may have qualified for coverage 
a portion of these settlements was recorded as income for reimbursement of past claim payments under the settled 
table of contents insurance policies and a portion was recorded as a deferred settlement credit for future claim payments 
at december  and  the deferred settlement credit was million and million  respectively  for which million and million  respectively  was reported in accrued expenses and approximately million and million  respectively  was reported in other non current liabilities 
the proceeds from such insurance settlements were reported as a component of net cash provided by operating activities in the period payments were received 
liabilities of divested businesses asbestos in may  we completed the tax free spin off of our engineered industrial products eip segment  which at the time of the spin off included enpro industries  inc enpro and coltec industries inc coltec 
at that time  two subsidiaries of coltec were defendants in a significant number of personal injury claims relating to alleged asbestos containing products sold by those subsidiaries prior to our ownership 
it is possible that asbestos related claims might be asserted against us on the theory that we have some responsibility for the asbestos related liabilities of enpro  coltec or its subsidiaries 
a limited number of asbestos related claims have been asserted against us as successor to coltec or one of its subsidiaries 
we believe that we have substantial legal defenses against these and other such claims 
in addition  the agreement between enpro and us that was used to effectuate the spin off provides us with an indemnification from enpro covering  among other things  these liabilities 
we believe that such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
other in connection with the divestiture of our tire  vinyl and other businesses  we have received contractual rights of indemnification from third parties for environmental and other claims arising out of the divested businesses 
failure of these third parties to honor their indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
guarantees at december   we had letters of credit and bank guarantees of million and residual value guarantees of lease obligations of million 
see note  financing arrangements and note  lease commitments to our consolidated financial statements 
aerostructures long term contracts our aerostructures business in the nacelles and interior systems segment has several long term contracts in the pre production phase including the boeing and airbus a xwb  and in the early production phase including the airbus a these contracts are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
the pre production phase includes design of the product to meet customer specifications as well as design of the processes to manufacture the product 
also involved in this phase is securing the supply of material and subcomponents produced by third party suppliers that are generally accomplished through long term supply agreements 
contracts in the early production phase include excess over average inventories  which represent the excess of current manufactured cost over the estimated average manufactured cost during the life of the contract 

table of contents cost estimates over the lives of contracts include projected impacts of future cost reductions including learning curve efficiencies 
because the above referenced contracts cover manufacturing periods of up to years or more  we assume greater risks associated with the estimates of these future costs made during the pre production and early production phases 
these estimates may be different from actual costs due to the following ability to recover costs incurred for change orders and claims  costs  including material and labor costs and related escalation  labor improvements due to the learning curve experience  anticipated cost productivity improvements related to new manufacturing methods and processes  supplier pricing including escalation where applicable  supplier claims see boeing contract discussions below and the supplier s ability to perform  the cost impact of product design changes that frequently occur during the flight test and certification phases of a program  and effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
additionally  total contract revenue is based on estimates of future units to be delivered to the customer and sales price escalation where applicable 
there is a risk that there could be differences between the actual units delivered and the estimated total units to be delivered under the contract and differences in actual sales escalation compared to estimates 
changes in estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period such losses are determined to the extent total estimated costs exceed total estimated contract revenues 
boeing contract discussions our aerostructures business entered into a long term supply contract with boeing on the program in the boeing program has experienced unexpected delays in its development schedule and boeing has requested numerous changes in the design of our product and scope of our work 
under the terms of our contract  we are entitled to reimbursement of certain costs and equitable price adjustments under certain circumstances 
discussions with boeing are ongoing 
on july   alenia aermacchi  spa aaem filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association against rohr  inc rohr  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours our aerostructures business  in connection with a contract for the supply of fan cowls used in the nacelles that rohr provides to boeing on the program 
according to its statement of claims filed on august   aaem seeks declaratory relief  rescission of the supply contract and monetary damages  based upon allegations of commercial impracticability  lack of compensation for costs associated with design changes and rohr s mismanagement of the program 
on september   rohr filed its answer  seeking to uphold the contract and denying liability  and instituted a counterclaim against aaem  seeking damages for breach of contract and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
on october   aaem filed its answer generally denying the allegations made against it in rohr s counterclaims 
on december   we amended our counterclaim to seek declaratory relief regarding ownership of certain intellectual property 
we believe that we have substantial legal and factual defenses to aaem s claims  and we intend to defend our interests and pursue our counterclaims vigorously 
given the nature and status of this proceeding  we cannot yet determine the amount or a reasonable range of potential loss  if any 
if we are unable to reach a fair and equitable resolution with boeing or adequately resolve the dispute with aaem discussed above  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows in a given period 

table of contents tax we are continuously undergoing examination by the irs  as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions 
the irs and other taxing authorities routinely challenge certain deductions and credits reported by us on our income tax returns 
tax years to during  we reached agreement with the irs on substantially all of the issues raised with respect to the examination of taxable years to we submitted a protest to the appeals division of the irs with respect to the remaining unresolved issues 
we believe the amount of the estimated tax liability if the irs were to prevail is fully reserved 
we cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of a final resolution of the remaining unresolved issues 
tax years prior to the previous examination cycle included the consolidated income tax groups for the audit periods identified below coltec industries inc and subsidiaries december  july  through date of acquisition goodrich corporation and subsidiaries including rohr and coltec we previously reached final settlement with the irs on all but one of the issues raised in this examination cycle 
we received statutory notices of deficiency dated june  related to the remaining unresolved issue which involves the proper timing of certain deductions 
we filed a petition with the us tax court in september to contest the notices of deficiency 
we believe the amount of the estimated tax liability if the irs were to prevail is fully reserved 
although it is reasonably possible that this matter could be resolved during the next months  the timing or ultimate outcome is uncertain 
rohr has been under examination by the state of california for the tax years ended july   and the state of california has disallowed certain expenses incurred by one of rohr s subsidiaries in connection with the lease of certain tangible property 
california s franchise tax board held that the deductions associated with the leased equipment were non business deductions 
the additional tax associated with the franchise tax board s position is approximately million 
the amount of accrued interest associated with the additional tax is approximately million at december  in addition  the state of california enacted an amnesty provision that imposes nondeductible penalty interest equal to of the unpaid interest amounts relating to taxable years ended before the penalty interest is approximately million at december  the tax and interest amounts continue to be contested by rohr 
we believe that we are adequately reserved for this contingency 
no payment has been made for the million of interest or million of penalty interest 
the franchise tax board took the position that under california law  rohr was required to pay the full amount of interest prior to filing any suit for refund 
in april  the supreme court of california denied the franchise tax board s final appeal on this procedural matter and rohr can proceed with its refund suit 
although it is reasonably possible that this matter could be resolved during the next months  the timing or ultimate outcome is uncertain 
following settlement of the us tax court case for rohr  inc s tax years to  california audited our amended tax returns and issued an assessment based on numerous issues including proper timing of deductions and allowance of tax credits 
we have submitted a protest of the assessment to the california franchise tax board 
we believe that we are adequately reserved for this contingency 
we cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of this matter 

table of contents tax settlements there were numerous tax issues that had been raised by the irs as part of the prior examination cycle  including  but not limited to  transfer pricing  research and development credits  foreign tax credits  tax accounting for long term contracts  tax accounting for inventory  tax accounting for stock options  depreciation  amortization and the proper timing for certain other deductions for income tax purposes 
we previously reached tentative settlement agreements with the irs on substantially all of the issues raised with respect to the prior examination cycle 
due to the amounts of tax involved certain portions of the tentative settlement agreements were required to be reviewed by the joint committee on taxation jct 
we received notification on april  that the jct approved the tentative settlement agreement entered into with the irs with regard to rohr  inc and subsidiaries for the period from july  through december  
as a result of receiving the jct notification  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million  primarily related to the reversal of tax reserves  during in addition to the jct approvals with regard to rohr  we reached agreement with the irs regarding most of the issues with respect to coltec industries inc and subsidiaries for the period from december  through july  
consequently  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million  primarily related to the reversal of tax reserves in during  we reached final settlement with the irs on substantially all of the issues relating to the goodrich corporation and subsidiaries examination cycle

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  financing obligations  warranty obligations  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring  long term service contracts  share based compensation  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition contract accounting percentage of completion we have sales under long term contracts  many of which contain escalation clauses  requiring delivery of products over several years and frequently providing the buyer with option pricing on follow on orders 
sales and profits on each contract are recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting  primarily using the units of delivery method 
we follow the requirements of sop  using the cumulative catch up method in accounting for revisions in estimates 
under the cumulative catch up method  the impact of revisions in estimates related to units shipped to date is recognized immediately when changes in estimated contract profitability are known 
estimates of revenue and cost for our contracts span a period of many years from the inception of the contracts to the date of actual shipments and are based on a substantial number of underlying assumptions 
we believe that the underlying factors are sufficiently reliable to provide a reasonable estimate of the profit to be generated 
however  due to the significant length of time over which revenue streams will be generated  the variability of the assumptions of the revenue and cost streams can be significant if the factors change 
the factors include but are not limited to estimates of the following escalation of future sales prices under the contracts  ability to recover costs incurred for change orders and claims  costs  including material and labor costs and related escalation  labor improvements due to the learning curve experience  anticipated cost productivity improvements related to new manufacturing methods and processes  supplier pricing including escalation where applicable and the supplier s ability to perform  the cost impact of product design changes that frequently occur during the flight test and certification phases of a program  and effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations 

table of contents inventory inventoried costs on long term contracts include certain pre production costs  consisting primarily of tooling and design costs and production costs  including applicable overhead 
the costs attributed to units delivered under long term commercial contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced and are determined under the learning curve concept  which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
during the early years of a contract  manufacturing costs per unit delivered are typically greater than the estimated average unit cost for the total contract 
this excess manufacturing cost for units shipped results in an increase in inventory referred to as excess over average during the early years of a contract 
if in process inventory plus estimated costs to complete a specific contract exceed the anticipated remaining sales value of such contract  such excess is charged to cost of sales in the period recognized  thus reducing inventory to estimated realizable value 
unbilled receivables our aerostructures business is party to a long term supply arrangement whereby we receive cash payments for our performance over a period that extends beyond our performance period of the contract 
the contract is accounted for using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
unbilled receivables include revenue recognized that will be realized from cash payments to be received beyond the period of performance 
in estimating our revenues to be received under the contract  cash receipts that are expected to be received beyond the performance period are included at their present value as of the end of the performance period 
unbilled receivables that are expected to be realized by cash receipts within the performance period are classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet whereas those expected to be realized by cash receipts beyond the performance period are classified as long term 
at december   there were no unbilled receivables classified as long term 
product maintenance arrangements we have entered into long term product maintenance arrangements to provide specific products and services to customers for a specified amount per flight hour  brake landing and or aircraft landings 
we account for such contracts in accordance with fasb technical bulletin no 
accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts ftb 
as such  revenue is recognized as the service is performed and the costs are incurred 
we have sufficient historical evidence that indicates that the costs of performing the service under the contract are incurred on other than a straight line basis 
income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting principles board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for income taxes in interim periods  as of each interim reporting period  we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
in addition  we establish reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
the estimate of our effective income tax rate involves significant judgments regarding the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions and estimates as to the amount and jurisdictional source of income expected to be earned during the full fiscal year 
further influencing this estimate are evolving interpretations of new and existing tax laws  rulings by taxing authorities and court decisions 
due to the subjective and complex nature of these underlying issues  our actual effective tax rate and related tax liabilities may differ from our initial estimates 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they 
table of contents become known 
the resulting adjustment to our income tax expense could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period the adjustment is recorded 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets impairments of identifiable intangible assets are recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset  or related groups of assets  may not be recoverable and our estimate of undiscounted cash flows over the assets remaining useful lives is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the determination of undiscounted cash flow is based on our segments plans 
the revenue growth is based upon aircraft build projections from aircraft manufacturers and widely available external publications 
the profit margin assumption is based upon the current cost structure and anticipated cost reductions 
changes to these assumptions could result in the recognition of impairment 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually  or when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
our annual testing date is november we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related reporting units 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations  and is compared to its carrying value 
the amount of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we estimate the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any impairment exists 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by a long term growth rate and a discount rate derived from our weighted average cost of capital at the date of evaluation 
other assets as with any investment  there are risks inherent in recovering the value of participation payments  sales incentives  flight certification costs  and entry fees 
such risks are consistent with the risks associated in acquiring a revenue producing asset in which market conditions may change or the risks that arise when a manufacturer of a product on which a royalty is based has business difficulties and cannot produce the product 
such risks include but are not limited to the following changes in market conditions that may affect product sales under the program  including market acceptance and competition from others  performance of subcontract suppliers and other production risks  bankruptcy or other less significant financial difficulties of other program participants  including the aircraft manufacturer  the oe manufacturers oem and other program suppliers or the aircraft customer  and availability of specialized raw materials in the marketplace 
participation payments certain of our businesses make cash payments under long term contractual arrangements to oem or system contractors in return for a secured position on an aircraft program 
participation payments are capitalized  when a contractual liability has been incurred  as other assets and amortized as a reduction to sales  as appropriate 
at december  and december   
table of contents the carrying amount of participation payments was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amount of participation payments is evaluated for recovery at least annually or when other indicators of impairment exist  such as a change in the estimated number of units or a revision in the economics of the program 
if such estimates change  amortization expense is adjusted and or an impairment charge is recorded  as appropriate  for the effect of the revised estimates 
no such impairment charges were recorded in  or see note  supplemental balance sheet information to our consolidated financial statements 
sales incentives we offer sales incentives such as up front cash payments  merchandise credits and or free products to certain airline customers in connection with sales contracts 
the cost of these incentives is recognized in the period incurred unless recovery of these costs is specifically guaranteed by the customer in the contract 
if the contract contains such a guarantee  then the cost of the sales incentive is capitalized as other assets and amortized to cost of sales  or as a reduction to sales  as appropriate 
at december  and december   the carrying amount of sales incentives was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amount of sales incentives is evaluated for recovery when indicators of potential impairment exist 
the carrying value of the sales incentives is also compared annually to the amount recoverable under the terms of the guarantee in the customer contract 
if the amount of the carrying value of the sales incentives exceeds the amount recoverable in the contract  the carrying value is reduced 
no such impairment charges were recorded in  or see note  supplemental balance sheet information to our consolidated financial statements 
flight certification costs when a supply arrangement is secured  certain of our businesses may agree to supply hardware to an oem to be used in flight certification testing and or make cash payments to reimburse an oem for costs incurred in testing the hardware 
the flight certification testing is necessary to certify aircraft systems components for the aircraft s airworthiness and allows the aircraft to be flown and thus sold in the country certifying the aircraft 
flight certification costs are capitalized in other assets and are amortized to cost of sales  or as a reduction to sales  as appropriate 
at december  and december   the carrying amount of sales flight certification costs was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amount of flight certification costs is evaluated for recovery when indicators of impairment exist or when the estimated number of units to be manufactured changes 
no such impairment charges were recorded in  or see note  supplemental balance sheet information to our consolidated financial statements 
entry fees our aerostructures business in our nacelles and interior systems segment made a cash payment to an oem under a long term contractual arrangement related to a new engine program 
the payments are referred to as entry fees and entitle us to a controlled access supply contract and a percentage of total program revenue generated by the oem 
entry fees are capitalized in other assets and are amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction to sales 
at december   the carrying amount of entry fees was million 
at december   the carrying amount of entry fees was million  including million capitalized in our electronic systems segment 
the amounts previously capitalized in our electronic systems segment decreased due to the modification of these contractual arrangements in connection with the formation of a joint venture see note  investment in joint venture to our consolidated financial statements 
the carrying amount of entry fees is evaluated for recovery at least annually or when other significant assumptions or economic conditions change 
recovery of entry fees is assessed based on the expected cash flow from the program over the remaining 
table of contents program life as compared to the recorded amount of entry fees 
if the carrying value of the entry fees exceeds the cash flow to be generated from the program  a charge would be recorded to reduce the entry fees to their recoverable amounts 
no such impairment charges were recorded in  or see note  supplemental balance sheet information to our consolidated financial statements 
service and product warranties we provide service and warranty policies on certain of our products 
we accrue liabilities under service and warranty policies based upon specific claims and a review of historical warranty and service claim experience in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no  accounting for contingencies 
adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience change 
in addition  we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with product performance issues 
our service and product warranty reserves are based upon a variety of factors 
any significant change in these factors could have a material impact on our results of operations 
such factors include but are not limited to the following the historical performance of our products and changes in performance of newer products  the mix and volumes of products being sold  and the impact of product changes 
share based compensation we utilize the fair value method of accounting to account for share based compensation awards 
assumptions stock options we use the black scholes merton formula to estimate the expected value that our employees will receive from the options based on a number of assumptions  such as interest rates  employee exercises  our stock price and expected dividend yield 
our weighted average assumptions include risk free interest rate expected dividend yield historical volatility factor weighted average expected life of the options years the expected life is a significant assumption as it determines the period for which the risk free interest rate  historical volatility and expected dividend yield must be applied 
the expected life is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options 
it is based on our historical experience with similar grants 
the risk free interest rate is based on the expected us treasury rate over the expected life 
historical volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life 
expected dividend yield is based on the stated dividend rate as of the date of grant 
restricted stock units the fair value of the restricted stock units is determined based upon the average of the high and low grant date fair value 
the weighted average grant date fair value during   and was  and per unit  respectively 

table of contents performance units the value of each award is determined based upon the average of the high and low fair value of our stock  as adjusted for a performance condition and a market condition 
the performance condition is applied to of the awards and is based upon our actual return on invested capital roic as compared to a target roic 
the market condition is applied to of the awards and is based on our relative total shareholder return rtsr as compared to the rtsr of a peer group of companies 
since the awards will be paid in cash  they are recorded as a liability award in accordance with sfas r and are marked to market each reporting period 
as such  assumptions are revalued for each award on an ongoing basis 
pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions our pension and postretirement benefits are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
plan assets have been valued at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements 
we consult with an outside actuary as to the appropriateness for many of the assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the annual expense for our worldwide pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions 
assumptions such as the rate of compensation increase and the long term rate of return on plan assets are based upon our historical and benchmark data  as well as our outlook for the future 
health care cost projections and the mortality rate assumption are evaluated annually 
the us discount rate was determined based on a customized yield curve approach 
our projected pension and postretirement benefit payment cash flows were each plotted against a yield curve composed of a large  diverse group of aa rated corporate bonds 
the resulting discount rates were used to determine the benefit obligations 
in canada and the uk  a similar approach to determining discount rates in the us was utilized 
the appropriate benchmarks by applicable country were used for pension plans other than those in the us  us and canada to determine the discount rate assumptions 
sensitivity analysis the table below quantifies the approximate impact at december  of a one quarter percentage point change in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for our pension plan cost and liability  holding all other assumptions constant 
the discount rate assumption is selected each year based on market conditions in effect as of the disclosure date 
the rate selected is used to measure liabilities as of the disclosure date and for calculating the following year s pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption  although reviewed each year  is changed less frequently due to the long term nature of the assumption 
this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of disclosure date  rather  it is used only in the calculation of pension expense

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use such derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
see note  derivatives and hedging activities in our consolidated financial statements for a description of current developments involving our hedging activities 
we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our outstanding variable rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
at december   a hypothetical basis point unfavorable change in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
at december  we had no interest rate swaps outstanding 
the table represents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates

table of contents foreign currency exposure we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include transactions denominated in foreign currencies  the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency and translation of income and expense and balance sheet amounts of our foreign subsidiaries to the us dollar 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to transaction and income risks through our normal operating activities and  where appropriate  through foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
foreign exchange negatively impacted our business segments financial results in approximately of our revenues and approximately of our costs are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
approximately of these net costs are in euros  great britain pounds sterling and canadian dollars 
we hedge a portion of our exposure of us dollar sales on an ongoing basis 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate  translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars will affect comparability of revenues and expenses between years 
we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to sell us dollars for great britain pounds sterling  canadian dollars  euros and polish zlotys 
these forward contracts are used to mitigate a portion of the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from changes in currency exchange rates 
as of december  we had the following forward contracts currency notional amount buy sell dollars in millions great britain pounds sterling buy canadian dollars buy euros buy polish zlotys buy these forward contracts mature on a monthly basis with maturity dates that range from january to december at december   a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies would decrease the value of the forward contracts described above by million 
the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts was a liability of million at december  because we hedge only a portion of our exposure  a strengthening of the us dollar as described above would have a more than offsetting benefit to our financial results in future periods 
in addition to the foreign exchange cash flow hedges  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk related to the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency 
these forward contracts generally mature monthly and the notional amounts are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in net monetary asset balances 
as of december   we had no forward contracts outstanding
