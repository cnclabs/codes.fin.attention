item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary to present a better understanding of the overall business of scientific games  we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with an overview of our business and major operating segments  including any significant events that have occurred in the periods presented 
we then provide a discussion of our critical accounting policies  including revenue recognition policies requiring critical judgment  our policies for accounting for share based payment  our valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  our income tax methodology and the use of estimates and assumptions throughout our financial results 
next  we discuss our results of operations  presenting first an overall view of the financial results of the business as a whole  followed by additional discussion of our operating segments 
we then review our financial condition  explaining changes in our balance sheet and cash flows  along with our outstanding debt  contractual obligations and commitments 
next we discuss the existence of any new accounting pronouncements and their impact on our financial statements 
our results may vary significantly from period to period depending on the addition or disposition of business units in each period 
the acquisition of the online lottery assets of essnet in march  the acquisitions of shoreline and global draw and certain related companies in april  the acquisitions of games media and ilc in december and the acquisition of ogt in may affect the comparability of operations from period to period 
our results are also significantly affected by  and may vary significantly from period to period depending on  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year traditionally comprise the weakest season for our diversified gaming segment 
as a result of inclement weather during the winter months  a number of racetracks do not operate and those that do operate often experience missed racing days 
this adversely affects the amounts wagered and our corresponding service revenues 
additionally  the fourth quarter is the weakest quarter for global draw due to reduced wagering during the holiday season 
wagering and lottery equipment sales and software license revenues usually reflect a limited number of large transactions  which do not recur on an annual basis 
consequently  revenues and operating results of our lottery systems group can vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of revenue recognition for major equipment sales and software licensing transactions 
in addition  printed products sales may vary depending on the season and timing of contract awards  changes in customer budgets  inventory ticket levels  lottery retail sales and general economic conditions 
during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a review of our contracts  organization  and operations 
as part of this review  we evaluated our cost structure  product margins  and individual contract profitability in order to make performance improvements beginning in these profitability improvement and cost savings initiatives include revising certain contracts to provide for a multi tiered pricing model that generates for the company an incremental percent of revenue for increasing sales for the customer  entering into multi state marketing ventures  declining to enter into any contracts or projects which offer inferior returns on invested capital and reducing headcount 
since december   we have had a contract with a lottery operator in mexico to supply an online lottery system  software and related services 
effective february   the parties agreed to terminate the contract in an orderly manner on or before october   in light of a change in economic circumstances including changes in the mexican tax structure relating to lotteries 
as part of the agreement  the system  terminals and communications equipment will revert to the company for potential later use 
accordingly  we have recorded a charge for anticipated losses during the shut down period and a charge to write off our investment in this contract to expected net realizable value 
background we operate primarily in three business segments printed products group  lottery systems group and diversified gaming group

the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
as described below  the determination of when to recognize revenue for certain revenue transactions requires judgment 
revenue from licensed branded property coupled with a service component whereby we purchase and distribute merchandise prized on behalf of the lottery authorities to identified winners is recognized on a proportional performance method as this method best reflects the pattern in which the obligations to customer are fulfilled 
a performance measure is used based on total estimated cost allocated to a specific contract 
by accumulating costs for services as they are incurred  and dividing such costs by the total contract costs which is estimated based on a budget prior to contract inception  a percentage is determined 
the percentage determined is applied to the total fixed price of the contract and that proportionate amount of revenue is recognized on a monthly basis 
revenue from the sale of lottery and pari mutuel systems that require the production and delivery of terminals and customized software is recognized using cost to cost measure of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses 
the use of the percentage of completion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design  manufacture  and delivery of our products 
estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
revenues under percentage of completion contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and  to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical performance or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant adverse change in the legality of our business ventures or the business climate in which we operate  and loss of a significant customer 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value using a two step impairment test 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow  using a discount rate equal to our weighted average cost of capital  or by a comparison to third party indications of fair market value 
the estimate of a reporting unit s fair value requires the use of assumptions and estimates regarding the reporting unit s future cash flows  growth rates and weighted average cost of capital 
any significant adverse changes in key assumptions about these businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge 
given the significance of goodwill  an adverse change to the estimated fair value could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements 
significant judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and products  it is possible that forecasts used to support our goodwill and trademark may change in the future which could result in significant non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations 
income taxes and deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years 
we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is unlikely 
we have established a valuation allowance for foreign loss carryforwards  as we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of these items will not be realized 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance  against our deferred tax assets  our income tax expense will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
on january   we began accounting for income tax contingencies in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
prior to the adoption of fin  we accounted for income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no

depreciation and amortization expense of million for the year ended december  decreased million or from the year ended december   primarily due to a million charge in the year ended december  related to the impairment of certain hardware and software assets in the pari mutuel business as a result of the roll out of our new terminal  the two new quantum data centers  and the write off of hardware and accrual of losses on certain under performing pari mutuel contracts  partially offset by increased depreciation resulting from the acquisition of global draw in april and global draw s rollout of the nevada terminals in september liquidity  capital resources and working capital in june  we entered into certain debt financing transactions structured to extend the average maturity of the company s debt  create additional borrowing capacity and revise certain financial covenants to be more favorable to the company

in connection with the credit agreement and the issuance of the notes  an aggregate of million was paid to certain financial institutions in the form of fees and initial purchasers discounts 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding long term and other debt 
as of december   our long term debt consists of million in aggregate principal amount of the notes  million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes  million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated debentures due the convertible debentures and borrowings under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility the revolver  and a million senior secured term loan credit facility the term loan 
short term debt includes approximately million of unsecured borrowings  denominated in chinese renminbi yuan rmb  from two banks in china and current installments on long term debt 
the credit agreement and the indentures governing the notes and the notes contain covenants customary for financings of these types  including negative covenants that  among other things  limit the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make distributions or certain other restricted payments  purchase or redeem capital stock  make investments or extend credit  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  engage in sale leaseback transactions  consummate certain asset sales  effect a consolidation or merger  sell  transfer  lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets  or create certain liens and other encumbrances on assets 
as of december   we had approximately million available for additional borrowing or letter of credit issuance under our revolver 
there were no borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit under our revolver as of december  our ability to borrow under the credit agreement will depend on us remaining in compliance with the limitations imposed by our lenders  including the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
see note to the consolidated financial statements long term and other debt for additional information regarding these financial ratios 
our pari mutuel wagering  online lottery  instant ticket validation and wide area gaming systems service contracts require us to  among other things  maintain the central computing system and related hardware in efficient working order  provide added software functionality upon request  provide on site computer operators  and furnish necessary supplies 
our primary expenditures associated with these services are personnel and related costs  which are expensed as incurred and are included in operating expenses services in the consolidated statements of income 
historically  the revenues we derive from our service contracts have exceeded the direct costs associated with fulfilling our obligations thereunder 
we expect that we will continue to realize positive cash flow and operating income as we extend or renew existing service contracts 
we also expect that we will enter into new contracts that are accretive to our cash flow 
in addition  through advancements in technology  we are continually deploying more efficient and cost effective methods for manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers 
we expect that technological efficiencies will continue to positively impact our future cash flows and operating results 
in the next year  we expect to purchase approximately  ticket checking machines for our contract with the china sports lottery for a total cost of approximately million 
we are not party to any other material short term or long term obligations or commitments pursuant to these service contracts 
periodically  we bid on new pari mutuel  instant ticket validation and wide area gaming and online lottery contracts 
once awarded  these contracts generally require significant up front capital expenditures for terminal assembly  customization of software  software and equipment installation and telecommunications configuration 
historically we have funded these up front costs through cash flows generated from operations  available cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our ability to continue to procure new contracts will depend on  among other things  our then present liquidity levels and or our ability to borrow at commercially acceptable rates to finance the initial up front costs 
once operational  long term service contracts have been accretive to our operating cash flow 
the actual level of capital expenditures will ultimately largely depend on the extent to which we are successful in winning new contracts 
furthermore  our pari mutuel wagering network consists of approximately  wagering terminals 
periodically  we elect to upgrade the technological capabilities of older terminals and replace terminals that have exhausted their useful lives 
servicing our installed terminal base requires that we maintain a supply of parts and accessories on hand 
we are also required  contractually in some cases  to provide spare parts over an extended period of time  principally in connection with our systems and terminal sale transactions 
to meet our contractual obligations and maintain sufficient levels of on hand inventory to service our installed base  we purchase inventory on an as needed basis 
we presently have no inventory purchase obligations  other than in the ordinary course of business 
at december   our available cash  short term investments and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at december  the amount of our available cash and short term investments fluctuates principally based on the timing of collections from our customers  cash expenditures associated with new and existing pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems contracts  borrowings or repayments under our credit facilities and changes in our working capital position 
the increase in our available cash from the december  level principally reflects the net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  of million  including a million cash dividend from cln  plus long term borrowings of million  offset by wagering and other capital expenditures and other investing activities totaling million  acquisition related payments of million and million of payments on long term debt 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities is derived from million of net cash provided by operations offset by million used in changes in working capital 
the working capital changes occurred principally from increases in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses  deposits and other current assets and accounts payable 
capital expenditures totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
wagering system expenditures  including software expenditures  totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to the new lottery contracts in connecticut and pennsylvania  coupled with gaming terminals related to global draw and games media 
cash flow from financing activities principally reflects the borrowings and the repayments of borrowings under the credit agreement and the notes 
at december   our available cash  short term investments and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at december  under the credit agreement  we had approximately million available for additional borrowings or letter of credit issuance under our revolver at december  the amount of our available cash and short term investments fluctuates principally based on the timing of collections from our customers  cash expenditures associated with new and existing pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems contracts  borrowings or repayments under our credit facilities and changes in our working capital position 
the increase in our available cash from the december  level principally reflects the net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  of million plus long term borrowings of million  offset by wagering and other capital expenditures and other investing activities totaling million  acquisition related payments of million and million of payments on long term debt 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities is derived from million of net cash provided by operations offset by million used in changes in working capital 
the working capital changes occurred principally from increases in accounts receivable  inventories and accrued liabilities and decreases in accounts payable  partially offset by a decrease in other current assets 
capital expenditures totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the corresponding period in wagering system expenditures  including software expenditures  totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in this increase is primarily due to the new lottery contracts in mexico and connecticut  coupled with gaming terminals related to global draw 
cash flow from financing activities principally reflects the repayments of borrowings under the credit agreement 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs  including anticipated capital expenditures  for the foreseeable future  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
while we are not aware of any particular trends  our contracts periodically renew and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in sustaining our cash flow from operations through renewal of our existing contracts or through the addition of new contracts 
during  we expect to implement plans to reduce operating costs and capital expenditures and pay down between million and million of our outstanding indebtedness although the actual amount of indebtedness that we pay down during may fall outside of this range 
in addition  lottery customers in the united states generally require service providers to provide performance bonds in connection with each state contract 
our ability to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms is subject to prevailing market conditions  which may be impacted by economic and political events 
although we have not experienced any difficulty obtaining such bonds  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
while we are not aware of any reason to do so  if we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness  on or before maturity  or provide letters of credit or cash in lieu of performance bonds  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
under the terms of our convertible debentures  the holders of the convertible debentures may require us to repurchase some or all of their debentures for cash on june  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures being repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
if current market conditions continue and our common stock continues to trade at current levels  it is likely that the holders of the debentures will exercise this repurchase right 
in connection with that repurchase right  the terms of our credit agreement provide that the our term loan and our revolver will both mature on march   unless one of the following conditions is met the right of holders of our convertible debentures to require the repurchase of their convertible debentures is eliminated  our convertible debentures are refinanced  redeemed or defeased or a trust or escrow is established  on terms reasonably satisfactory to the administrative agent under our credit agreement  for purposes of and in an amount sufficient to discharge all payment obligations with respect to our convertible debentures  or the sum of the aggregate unused and available revolving facility commitments plus our unrestricted cash is not less than the sum of the principal amount of our convertible debentures then outstanding plus million 
in addition  our notes mature on december  in connection with the anticipated maturity of these notes  the terms of our credit agreement provide our term loan and our revolver will both mature on september   unless one of the following conditions is met these notes are refinanced  redeemed or defeased or a trust or escrow is established  on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the administrative agent  for purposes of and in an amount sufficient to discharge these notes  or the sum of the aggregate unused and available revolving facility commitments plus our unrestricted cash is not less than the sum of the principal amount of these notes then outstanding plus million 
we intend to take the steps necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth above in a timely manner  including implementing plans to reduce operating costs and capital expenditures during however  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources  or will be able to arrange financing  to satisfy such conditions or to repay any accelerated indebtedness under our credit agreement or  even if we obtain a waiver from our lenders under our credit agreement  to repurchase our convertible debentures in or such later date as such repurchase may be required  or to repay in our notes 
the terms of the indenture governing the convertible debentures give holders the right to convert the convertible debentures under certain circumstances 
the convertible debentures contain a net settlement feature 
this feature entitles holders of each  principal amount of convertible debentures being converted to receive cash up to  and shares for any excess conversion value determined in a manner provided in the indenture governing the convertible debentures 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this conversion right 
on february   our board of directors approved an increase to the amount authorized under our previously announced program for the repurchase of our convertible debentures from million to million in aggregate principal amount 
there was approximately million in aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures outstanding as of december  purchases are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations  borrowings  or a combination thereof 
the manner  timing and amount of purchases will be determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions  price of the convertible debentures and other factors 
the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness and future minimum operating lease obligations  as set forth in the table below in thousands cash payments due by period total within year within years within years after years long term debt  notes long term debt  debentures long term debt  notes long term debt  term loan unsecured borrowings denominated in rmb other long term debt interest expense global draw earn out contractual capital requirements operating leases serp payout other long term liabilities total contractual obligations refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding long term and other debt 
the convertible debentures are due in however  these convertible debentures could require cash payment before that date if holders of these convertible debentures exercise their right to require us to repurchase their convertible debentures or elect to convert the convertible debentures  subject to certain conditions  if we call the convertible debentures for redemption  or upon certain corporate transactions 
based on rates in effect at december  in accordance with the purchase agreement for the acquisition of global draw  we estimate that an earn out of approximately million to million may be paid to the selling shareholders and certain members of the management of global draw in see note pension and other post retirement plans for information regarding the serp 
we have excluded approximately million of long term pension plan and other post retirement liabilities  deferred compensation liabilities of approximately million and the liability for uncertain tax positions of million at december  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid

we adopted fsp apb on january  the impact of adoption was an adjustment to accumulated earnings of approximately million representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  and a remaining debt discount of approximately million on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  in addition we will report additional interest expense of approximately million in our consolidated statement of operations for  and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our products and services are sold to a diverse group of customers throughout the world 
as such  we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as a result of changes in general economic conditions  sources of supply  competition  foreign exchange rates  tax reform  litigation and regulatory developments 
see item a risk factors for a more complete description of these risks and uncertainties 
the diversity and breadth of our products and geographic operations mitigate the risk that adverse changes from any single event would materially affect our financial position 
additionally  as a result of the diversity of our customer base  we do not consider ourselves exposed to concentration of credit risks 
these risks are further minimized by setting credit limits  ongoing monitoring of customer account balances  and assessment of the customers financial strengths 
inflation has not had an abnormal or unanticipated effect on our operations 
inflationary pressures would be significant to our business if raw materials used for instant lottery ticket production  prepaid phone card production or terminal manufacturing are significantly affected 
available supply from the paper and electronics industries tends to fluctuate and prices may be affected by supply 
for fiscal  inflation was not a significant factor in our results of operations  and we were not impacted by significant pricing changes in our costs  except for personnel related expenditures 
we are unable to forecast the prices or supply of substrate  component parts or other raw materials in  but we currently do not anticipate any substantial changes that will materially affect our operating results 
in certain limited cases  our lottery contracts with our customers contain provisions to adjust for inflation on an annual basis  but we cannot be assured that this adjustment would cover raw material price increases or other costs of services 
while we have long term and generally satisfactory relationships with most of our suppliers  we also believe alternative sources to meet our raw material and production needs are available 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and equity market risks as we seek debt and equity capital to sustain our operations 
at december   approximately of our debt was in fixed rate instruments 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates

effective october   sgi entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement the hedge with jpmorgan chase bank na jpmorgan 
under the hedge  sgi will pay interest on a million notional amount of debt at a fixed rate of and will receive interest on a million notional amount of debt at the prevailing three month libor rate 
the objective of the hedge is to eliminate the variability of cash flows attributable to the libor component of interest expense paid on million of our variable rate debt 
principal amount by expected maturity average interest rate december  dollars in thousands twelve months ended december thereafter total fmv debt at fixed interest rates weighted average interest rates debt at variable interest rates weighted average interest rates we are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in the united kingdom  germany  the netherlands  spain  sweden  mexico  austria  australia  chile and ireland 
our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term investments 
accordingly  we do not hedge these net investments 
our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the euro and the sterling in relation to the united states dollar 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures  which can adversely affect our results of operations 
we manage our foreign currency exchange risks on a global basis by one or more of the following i securing payment from our customers in us dollars  when possible  ii entering into foreign currency exchange contracts and iii netting asset and liability exposures denominated in similar foreign currencies  to the extent possible 
in addition  a significant portion of the cost attributable to our foreign operations is incurred in the local currencies 
we may  from time to time  enter into foreign currency exchange or other contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain firm sales commitments  anticipated revenue streams and certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
based upon analysis as of december   we believe a hypothetical change in foreign exchange rates could be material to our future earnings 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments are in high quality securities placed with a wide array of institutions with high credit ratings 
the investment policy limits our exposure to concentration of credit risks 
we believe that the impact of a increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our investment income and interest expense from bank loans
