overview 
we are engaged primarily in the ownership and operation of multifamily residential units 
we also provide asset and property management services to third party owners of multifamily residential units for which we are paid fees 
our primary source of cash and revenue from operations is rents from the leasing of owned apartment units  which represented of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  the operating performance of our properties is affected by general economic trends including but not limited to factors such as household formation  job growth  unemployment rates  population growth  immigration  the supply of new multifamily rental communities and in certain markets the supply of other housing alternatives  such as condominiums  single and multifamily rental homes and owner occupied single and multifamily homes 
additionally  our performance may be affected by the access to and cost of capital 
rental revenue collections are a combination of rental rates  occupancy levels and rent concessions 
we attempt to adjust these factors to adapt to changing market conditions  thus allowing us to maximize rental revenue 
indicators that we use in measuring these factors include physical occupancy and net rents 
these indicators are more fully described in the results of operations comparison 
additionally  we consider property noi to be an important indicator of our overall performance 
property noi property operating revenue less property operating and maintenance expenses is a measure of the profitability of our properties  which has the largest impact of all of our sources of income and expense on our financial condition and operating results 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k for additional information regarding property noi and total noi  in addition to a reconciliation of total noi to consolidated net income in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
we have three reportable segments acquisition disposition multifamily properties  same community multifamily properties  and management and service operations 
we previously reported a fourth segment  affordable housing multifamily properties  however  during the first half of  all of our wholly owned affordable housing properties were sold 
therefore  the financial information at december   and all prior periods for all of the previously wholly owned affordable housing properties are reported as discontinued operations in the acquisition disposition multifamily properties segment 
we have identified our reportable segments based upon how management makes decisions regarding resource allocation and performance assessment 
our same community portfolio consists of properties containing  units and accounted for of total property revenue in and of our property noi 
during noi for the same community portfolio increased 
this growth was due to an increase of for our midwest portfolio  while our mid atlantic southeast portfolio decreased 
in  at the midpoint of our guidance  we expect same community noi to decline approximately compared to we intend to continue divesting non core midwest properties so long as we can do so at our target prices 
we also intend to continue to evaluate potential property acquisitions in higher growth markets that we have identified and to acquire properties when our investment criteria warrant a new acquisition 
we may also consider selling assets in any market  including the mid atlantic and southeast markets  where market conditions are such that the reinvestment of cash proceeds derived from a sale are expected to provide over time a significantly greater return on equity or an increase in cash flow 
we are also focused on reducing overall interest charges on our borrowings  which at december   had a weighted average rate of 
we plan to accomplish this goal by using a portion of any sale proceeds to pay off debt or refinance existing debt with new debt at lower interest rates 
in order to maximize property noi  we plan to continue to focus our efforts on improving revenue  controlling costs and realizing operational efficiencies at the property level  both regionally and portfolio wide 
expectations portfolio performance at the midpoint of our guidance  we expect same community property noi to decrease in and we expect property revenue to remain relatively flat while property operating expenses increase compared to property acquisitions and sales we plan to acquire approximately million of properties  while disposing of approximately million of properties 
we also plan to develop units on land adjacent to one of our properties in the richmond  virginia metropolitan area  for an approximate cost of million 
defeasance and other prepayment costs we expect net defeasance prepayment costs to be approximately million to defease prepay or refinance debt during forecast qualification 
the uncertainties caused by the current economic turndown and the unprecedented financial crisis complicate our ability to forecast future performance and disposition acquisition activity 
we believe that the apartment industry is better situated to weather the recession and financial crisis than other real estate sectors  because people will normally choose shelter over discretionary spending such as going to the mall or hotel stays and because government sponsored agencies such as fannie mae and freddie mac continue to provide needed financing and refinancing credit facilities  which are otherwise unavailable to other commercial real estate sectors 
however  our expectations may be adversely impacted if recessionary forces accelerate or congress curtails fannie mae or freddie mac financing support to the apartment industry 
federal income taxes 
we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended  commencing with our taxable year ending december  reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that of the income that would otherwise be considered as taxable income be distributed to shareholders 
providing we continue to qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on net income 
however  our service companies are subject to federal income tax 
a reit is precluded from owning more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer  other than a wholly owned subsidiary or another reit  and more than of the value of all securities of any one issuer 
as an exception to this prohibition  a reit is allowed to own up to of the securities of a trs that can provide non customary services to reit tenants and others without disqualifying the rents that a reit receives from its tenants 
however  no more than of the value of a reit s total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trs s 
the amount of intercompany interest and other expenses between a trs and a reit are subject to arms length allocations 
we have elected trs status for all of our service companies 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows and liquidity 
significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows significant cash sources uses year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities fixed assets property land acquisitions  net net property disposition proceeds recurring  revenue enhancing and non recurring capital expenditures debt decrease in mortgage notes increase in revolver borrowings cash dividends and operating partnership distributions paid purchase of preferred and or treasury shares our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow provided by operations  short term borrowings on the revolver and proceeds from property sales 
we believe that we are well positioned to weather the recent turmoil in the financial markets 
our debt repayment obligations are relatively modest 
we have four mortgage loans totaling approximately million maturing in in february  we repaid two of those loans totaling million with million of proceeds from two new mortgage loans and million of borrowings on our revolver 
we have a mortgage loan commitment in the amount of million which we plan to use toward the refinancing of a third loan maturing this year 
we will utilize our revolver to repay all other debt maturing in our revolver matures march  we anticipate that cash flow provided by operations for will be adequate to fund our cash needs other than the debt repayments described above and million required to develop our unit expansion of one of our richmond  virginia properties 
we intend to fund the development with borrowings on our revolver 
cash flow provided by operations decreased in compared to primarily due to a reduction in accrued real estate taxes and funds held for managed properties in compared to this decrease was partially offset by increased cash flow from property operations in when compared to the increase in cash provided by operations in compared to was primarily due to an increase in property revenues provided mainly by two properties acquired in june and a reduction in defeasance and other prepayment costs incurred in compared to this increase in cash flow was partially offset by changes in accounts payable and accounts receivable resulting from the timing of cash payments 
during  we received net proceeds of million from the sale of properties 
million of those proceeds were used to partially fund the acquisition of two properties located in the richmond  virginia metropolitan area and million of those proceeds were used to acquire the ground lessor s interest in ground leases at six affordable housing properties  which ground leases we needed to acquire in order to complete the sale of those properties 
million of these proceeds were used to repay and or defease debt  million was used to fund revenue enhancing non recurring fixed asset additions  and the remaining million was used for other general corporate purposes 
in march  we increased the borrowing capacity on our unsecured revolving credit facility to million from million  extended the maturity date of this facility for an additional year to march   and modified certain financial covenants 
shelf availability 
in november  we filed a new shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission relating to possible offerings  from time to time  of debt securities  preferred shares  depositary shares  common shares and common share warrants 
this registration statement replaced the shelf registration statement that expired in december securities offerings up to million would be available under the new shelf registration statement once approved by the sec 
the new shelf registration would expire three years from its effective date 
however  until the capital markets improve  it is unlikely that we will be in a position to issue securities under this registration statement 
moreover  major modifications to the shelf registration debt covenants contained in the indenture  currently in place  would be necessary before the issuance of any debt securities under the shelf registration 
liquidity normal business operations 
we anticipate that we will meet our normal business operations and liquidity requirements for the upcoming year generally through net cash provided by operations 
we believe that if net cash provided by operations is below projections  other sources  such as the revolver  secured and unsecured borrowings  and property sales proceeds are or can be made available and should be sufficient to meet our normal business operations and liquidity requirements 
liquidity non operational activities 
sources of cash available for paying down debt  acquiring properties or buying back our shares are expected to be provided primarily by property sale proceeds  refinancings and from the revolver long term contractual obligations

purchase obligations 
purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services and contracts for the acquisition of properties that are legally binding and enforceable and that specify all significant terms of the agreement 
our purchase obligations include  but are not limited to  vendor contracts for property operations entered into in the normal course of operations  such as for landscaping  snow removal  elevator maintenance  security  trash removal and electronically generated services 
obligations included in the above table represent agreements dated december   or earlier 
dividends 
on december   we declared a dividend of per common share  which was paid on february   to shareholders of record on january  we anticipate that we will continue paying quarterly regular dividends in cash and that our board of directors will sustain our current dividend rate of per quarter 
additionally  on january   we declared a quarterly dividend of per depositary share on our class b cumulative redeemable preferred shares  which will be paid on march   to shareholders of record on february  capital expenditures 
we anticipate incurring approximately million in capital expendi tures for this includes replacement of worn carpet and appliances  parking lots  roofs and similar items in accordance with our current property expenditure plan  as well as commitments for investment revenue enhancing and non recurring expenditures 
these commitments are expected to be funded largely with cash provided by operating activities

we lease certain equipment and facilities under operating leases 
future minimum lease payments under all noncancellable operating leases in which we are the lessee  are included in the previous table of contractual obligations 
off balance sheet investments and financing commitments 
on december   the joint venture in which we were a partner sold the affordable housing property that it owned 
we accounted for our investment in this unconsolidated joint venture under the equity method of accounting as we exercised significant influence  but did not control this entity and were not required to consolidate it in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities or under eitf  investor s accounting for an investment in a limited partnership when the investor is the sole general partner and the limited partners have certain rights 
this investment was initially recorded at cost as investment in joint ventures and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings  cash contributions and distributions  and the gain recognized upon the sale of the property 
the debt associated with this property was assumed by the buyer and we have no continuing involvement with the property or the assumed debt 
for summarized financial information related to our joint venture investments  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
operating partnership 
as provided in the aerc hp investors limited partnership agreement downreit partnership  we  as general partner  have guaranteed the obligation of the downreit partnership to redeem op units held by the limited partners 
the downreit partnership was formed in under the terms of the downreit partnership agreement  the downreit partnership is obligated to redeem op units for our common shares or cash  at our discretion  at a price per op unit equal to the day trailing price of our common shares for the immediate day period preceding a limited partner s redemption notice 
as of december   there were  op units remaining having a carrying value of million  and  of the original  op units had been redeemed 
these transactions had the effect of increasing our interest in the downreit partnership from to 
for additional information regarding the op units  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
acquisitions and development 
on april   we acquired two apartment communities located in the richmond  virginia metropolitan area totaling units for a purchase price of million and additional closing costs of  the acquisition also included a acre future development land parcel  adjacent to one of the properties 
this purchase was funded by the assumption of mortgage loans encumbering the acquired properties  section exchange cash proceeds and borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
we intend to continue to evaluate potential property acquisitions in historically higher growth markets that we previously identified 
any future property acquisitions or developments would be financed with the most appropriate sources of capital  which may include the assumption of mortgage indebtedness  bank and other institutional borrowings  the exchange of properties  undistributed earnings  secured or unsecured debt financings  or the issuance of shares or units exchangeable into common shares 
dispositions 
during  we sold properties  including our entire affordable housing portfolio of properties  for net cash proceeds of million 
the operating results of these properties  along with the gains of million that we recognized  are included in income from discontinued operations 
management and service operations 
revenues from our management and service operations were significantly reduced in as a result of our exit from the affordable housing business at the end of as of december   we managed one affordable housing property for an affiliated third party and two market rate properties for third party owners 
the affordable housing property is expected to be sold during  after which we will no longer manage this property and therefore not receive management fees 
we are also the asset manager for one residential property and one commercial property 
results of operations for compared with and compared with in the following discussion of the comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  and the year ended december  to the year ended december   same community properties represent wholly owned properties 
acquired disposed properties represent two properties acquired in june  two properties acquired in april  and one property classified as held for sale at december  during the to comparison period  operating income increased million primarily as a result of increased property revenue  which was partially offset by increases in property operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense 
losses from continuing operations decreased by million during this comparison period as a result of the increase in operating income  a decrease in interest expense of million  which was primarily due to decreased debt defeasance prepayment costs  and an increase in equity in net income loss of joint ventures of million  which was primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of a joint venture property 
during the to comparison period  operating income increased million primarily as a result of increased property revenue  which was partially offset by increases in property operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense 
losses from continuing operations during this comparison period decreased by million primarily as a result of an interest expense reduction of million  attributable to decreased debt defeasance prepayment costs  and the million increase in operating income

property revenue is impacted by a combination of rental rates  rent concessions and occupancy levels  ie  net collected rent per unit 
we measure these factors using indicators such as physical occupancy number of units occupied divided by total number of units at the end of the period and average monthly net rent per unit gross potential rents less concessions divided by total number of units 
this information is presented in the following table for the years ended december   and physical occupancy for the year ended december  same community properties midwest mid atlantic southeast total same community acquired properties n a average monthly net collected rent per unit for the year ended december  same community properties midwest mid atlantic southeast total same community acquired properties n a property revenue increased in compared to primarily as a result of an increase of million contributed by the two properties acquired in and the two properties acquired in property revenue in the same community properties increased million primarily due to stable occupancy throughout the majority of combined with rental rate increases and an overall reduction in concessions 
property revenues increased in compared to primarily as a result of million contributed by the two properties acquired in and an increase of million in the same community properties which was primarily due to stable occupancy combined with rental rate increases and an overall reduction in concessions 
fees  reimbursements and other 
the management and service operations saw a decrease of million in fee revenue in compared to primarily as a result of the loss of management fee revenue associated with our exit from the affordable housing fee management business at the end of and the resulting reduction of properties managed for third party owners 
reimbursement of expense from managed properties decreased million in compared to also as a result of the reduction of the number of properties managed 
this reduction had no impact to the net loss from continuing operations as these reimbursements are also included in direct property management expenses 
property operating and maintenance expenses 
property operating and maintenance expenses for the same community segment increased  or in compared to  however total property operating and maintenance expenses increased million or in primarily as a result of the addition of expenses relating to acquired properties 
when comparing to  property operating and maintenance expenses for the same community segment increased million or  primarily as a result of increases in personnel expense  real estate tax expense and other operating expenses 
personnel expense increased due to increased salary and benefit costs 
real estate taxes increased due to taxes related to assessed property value and millage rate increases 
other operating expenses increased as a result of increases in the net write off of uncollectible tenant rent receivables and associated collection costs 
these increases were partially offset by a credit recorded during resulting from favorable property insurance loss experiences and a renegotiation of the self insured retention amounts 
property operating and maintenance expenses related to the acquired properties increased million in compared to depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased when comparing to and to primarily as a result of the acquisition of two properties in and two properties in direct property management and service company expenses 
direct property management and service company expenses decreased in compared to as a result of the reduction in the number of properties managed for third party owners 
the reimbursement of expenses from the managed properties decreased in  as noted on the previous page 
however  this reduction had no impact to the net loss from continuing operations as these reimbursements are also included in fees  reimbursements and other revenue 
additionally  service company expenses  which represent the portion of general and administrative expense that relates to the management of third party owned properties  decreased million in compared to due to the reduction in the number of properties managed 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense increased in primarily as a result of the reduction in costs allocated to direct property management and service company expenses  as noted above  an increase in of  related to pre acquisition and other project costs  and an increase in directors compensation expense in of  these increases were partially offset by decreases in payroll related costs in of  primarily as a result of our exit from the affordable housing fee management business in general and administrative expenses increased in compared to primarily due to increases in corporate payroll  bonus  and share based payment costs in these increases were partially offset by a reduction of  in directors compensation in compared to  primarily as a result of valuation adjustments of their deferred compensation based upon the closing price of our common shares at the end of each period 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased in compared to primarily due to a reduction of million in defeasance prepayment costs that were included in income from continuing operations 
interest expense decreased in compared to primarily due to a reduction of million in defeasance prepayment costs that were included in income from continuing operations 
interest expense  including defeasance prepayment costs that are associated with discontinued operations are included in income from discontinued operations  as discussed on the next page 
equity in net income loss of joint ventures 
on december   the joint venture in which we were a partner sold the affordable housing property that it owned 
our proportionate share of gain recognized in was million 
income from discontinued operations 
included in discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  are the operating results and the gains related to wholly owned properties that were sold in  three wholly owned properties that were sold in  eight wholly owned properties that were sold in  and one wholly owned property that was classified as held for sale at december  the operating loss from discontinued operations in and were primarily due to costs incurred to defease loans that were secured by properties that were sold 
for further details on income from discontinued operations  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
discount premium on preferred share repurchase 
in and  we repurchased  and  respectively  of our preferred depositary shares  which each represent th of a share of our class b series ii cumulative redeemable preferred shares 
the depositary shares have a recorded value of per share 
the average price that we paid per share for the repurchases was  and we therefore recognized a total discount of million 
the average price that we paid per share for the repurchases was  and we therefore recognized a premium of  inflation 
we believe that the effects of inflation only minimally impacts our operational performance because our leases are mostly for month terms  which allows us the opportunity to increase our new lease and lease renewal rents to account for inflationary price increases 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include accounts of all subsidiaries  the service companies and the operating partnership structured as a downreit 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have utilized information available including industry practice and our own past history in forming estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome that we anticipated in formulating the estimates inherent in these consolidated financial statements may not materialize 
however  application of the accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred 
in performing this analysis  we estimate holding periods of the assets  changes in fair market value of the assets and cash flows related to the operations of the assets to determine the range of potential alternatives and assign a probability to the various alternatives under consideration by management 
should the estimates used to determine alternatives or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change  an impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to review goodwill annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator 
in performing this analysis  we use a multiple of revenues to the range of potential alternatives and assign a probability to the various alternatives we consider 
should estimates used to determine the alternatives considered or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change  an impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
sfas no 
r  share based payment  requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options awarded 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock options  and the monte carlo method to estimate the fair value of awards in which the number of shares that will ultimately vest are subject to market conditions 
the use of judgment and or estimates is required in determining certain of the assumptions used by these valuation models 
if we had used different judgment and or estimates  different valuations would have been produced that may have resulted in a material change to our results of operations 
sfas no 
r also requires us to estimate future performance results related to certain share based awards 
if the results vary from our estimate  it may require us to make a material adjustment to our results of operations 
we estimate the amount of real estate taxes for which we will be liable based upon assumptions relating to possible changes in millage rates and property value reassessments 
in certain circumstances  it is possible that the actual millage rates or reassessment values are not available until the following reporting period and that these rates or values could differ from assumptions and require material adjustments to the liabilities recorded 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
based on our variable rate debt outstanding at december  and  an interest rate change of basis points would impact interest expense by approximately  and  on an annual basis  respectively 
additionally  we have interest rate risk associated with fixed rate debt at maturity 
we have  and will continue to manage  interest rate risk as follows i maintain what we believe to be a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level  ii consider hedges for certain long term variable and or fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps or interest rate caps  and iii consider the use of treasury locks where appropriate to hedge rates on anticipated debt transactions 
we use various financial models and advisors to assist us in analyzing opportunities to achieve those objectives
