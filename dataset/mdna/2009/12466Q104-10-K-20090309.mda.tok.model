item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation cautionary statement regarding forwarding looking statements this report contains statements concerning the corporation s expectations  plans  objectives  future financial performance and other statements that are not historical facts 
these statements may constitute forward looking statements as defined by federal securities laws 
these statements may address issues that involve estimates and assumptions made by management and risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from historical results or those anticipated by such statements 
factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the corporation include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates general business conditions  as well as conditions within the financial markets general economic conditions  including unemployment levels the legislative regulatory climate monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the treasury and the federal reserve board the quality or composition of the loan portfolios and the value of the collateral securing those loans the value of securities held in the corporation s investment portfolios the level of net charge offs on loans demand for loan products deposit flows the strength of the corporation s counterparties competition from both banks and non banks demand for financial services in the corporation s market area technology reliance on third parties for key services the commercial and residential real estate markets the corporation s expansion and technology initiatives accounting principles  policies and guidelines in addition  a continuation of the turbulence in significant portions of the global financial markets  particularly if it worsens  could impact the corporation s performance  both directly by affecting the corporation s revenues and the value of its assets and liabilities  and indirectly by affecting the corporation s counterparties and the economy generally 
concerns about the stability of the financial markets generally have reduced the availability of funding to certain financial institutions  leading to a tightening of credit  reduction of business activity and increased market volatility 
the eesa provides the treasury with broad authority to implement certain actions aimed at restoring stability and liquidity to us markets 
the eesa includes  among other things  the capital purchase program  the troubled assets relief program and the fdic tlgp 
it is not clear at this time what impact these programs  or any additional programs that may be initiated in the future by the treasury and other bank regulatory agencies  will have on the financial markets and the financial services industry or the corporation s business and financial performance 

table of contents although the corporation currently has diverse sources of liquidity and its capital ratios exceed the minimum levels required for well capitalized status  the corporation applied for a million investment by the treasury under its capital purchase program and was approved on december  the transaction closed on january  the corporation also elected to participate in the fdic debt guarantee program  however  the corporation currently has no unsecured borrowings to which this program applies 
c f bank is participating in the fdic transaction account guarantee program  under which all noninterest bearing transaction accounts as defined within the program are fully guaranteed by the fdic for the entire amount in the account through december  our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty or other relationships  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  and other institutional clients 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  could exacerbate the market wide liquidity crisis and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially adversely affect the corporation s results of operations 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements contained herein 
we caution readers not to place undue reliance on those statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
the following discussion supplements and provides information about the major components of the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of the corporation 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
those accounting policies with the greatest uncertainty and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments affecting the application of these policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions  or using different assumptions  are described below 
allowance for loan losses we establish the allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance 
the allowance represents an amount that  in our judgment  will be appropriate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
our judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans while taking into consideration such factors as trends in delinquencies and charge offs  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to repay and the value of collateral  overall portfolio quality and specific potential losses 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 

table of contents impairment of loans we measure impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
we consider a loan impaired when it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
we do not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect the ultimate collection of all amounts due 
we maintain a valuation allowance to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment 
impairment of securities impairment of investment securities results in a write down that must be included in net income when a market decline below cost is other than temporary 
we regularly review each investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market price  the duration of that market decline  the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer and our ability and intention with regard to holding the security to maturity 
other real estate owned assets acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell at the date of foreclosure  establishing a new cost basis 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations of the foreclosed assets based on updated appraisals  general market conditions  length of time the properties have been held  and our ability and intention with regard to continued ownership of the properties 
the corporation may incur additional write downs of foreclosed assets to fair value less costs to sell if valuations indicate a further other than temporary deterioration in market conditions 
goodwill goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
in assessing the recoverability of the corporation s goodwill  all of which was recognized in connection with the bank s acquisition of c f finance in september  we must make assumptions in order to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
major assumptions used in determining impairment were increases in future income  sales multiples in determining terminal value and the discount rate applied to future cash flows 
as part of the impairment test  we performed sensitivity analysis by increasing the discount rate  lowering sales multiples and reducing increases in future income 
we completed the annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of and determined there was no impairment to be recognized in if the underlying estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
retirement plan the bank maintains a non contributory  defined benefit pension plan for eligible full time employees as specified by the plan 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity securities and corporate and government fixed income securities  are valued using market quotations 
the bank s actuary determines plan obligations and annual pension expense using a number of key assumptions 
key assumptions may include the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of future salary increases 
changes in these assumptions in the future  if any  or in the method under which benefits are calculated may impact pension assets  liabilities or expense 
accounting for income taxes determining the corporation s effective tax rate requires judgment 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax outcomes are uncertain 
in addition  the corporation s tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
although we believe that the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different than that which is reflected in the income tax provision and accrual
