these increases were partially offset by decreases in sales of cough and flu products as well as urea based products 
dorzolamide with timolol ophthalmic solution  launched in october  became the company s largest selling product with sales of  fluticasone proprionate nasal spray  hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide syrup and dorzolamide ophthalmic solution contributed over  to the growth in sales 
additionally  the company experienced higher than normal levels of orders from customers late in the fourth quarter 
sales for the health care products division  which markets the company s branded otc products  were down slightly as sales of the newly launched zostrix neuropathy cream and nasal ease partially offset declines of in line products 
during the fiscal fourth quarter of  the fda prohibited the company from importing nasal ease due to an issue with labeling 
the company is working with the manufacturer to import a product with new specifications which meet all fda requirements 
in december  hi tech acquired the assets of midlothian laboratories  a company which markets and distributes generic products in the cough and cold and prescription vitamin markets 
the period represents four months of sales  while the period represents a full twelve months of sales 
sales in dropped in the fourth quarter  because a supplier of cough and cold medicines recalled multiple products which were sold by midlothian 
there is currently no supplier available to replace these products

in april  hi tech divested naprelan 
sales of naprelan in the fiscal year represent inventory sold as part of the divestiture 
cost of sales of sales of sales cost of sales the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is due to sales of newly launched products  in particular dorzolamide with timolol ophthalmic solution  dorzolamide ophthalmic solution and hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide syrup because these products have a higher margin 
as potential competitors come into the market and begin selling dorzolamide products  the company anticipates a decline in the sales price and gross profit margin for such products 
additionally  both midlothian laboratories and ecr pharmaceuticals have higher gross margins than hi tech s core generic business  therefore  increased sales from these divisions contributed to the higher gross margin 
the company increased overhead spending in the information systems  quality and regulatory areas 
this spending was offset by increased manufacturing volumes 
in connection with our transition to a new computer system in march  the company began expensing corrugated boxes at the time of purchase instead of including them in inventory

the company incurred a royalty expense during the year ended april  of approximately  based on gross profits on sales of dorzolamide with timolol ophthalmic solution since the launch on october  the company will continue to pay this royalty as long as the profitability on the product exceeds certain thresholds 
additional increases in the selling  general and administrative expenses include expenses of the midlothian division which incurred twelve months of expense in fiscal versus the prior year where it was only part of hi tech for four months 
additionally  the company acquired substantially all of the assets of e 
claiborne robins company  inc d b a ecr pharmaceuticals on february  ecr pharmaceuticals markets branded pharmaceuticals to doctors with a sales force of approximately fifty sales representatives  and therefore spends a higher proportion of its sales on selling  general and administrative expenses 
ecr pharmaceutical s selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  in fiscal the company also had increased amortization of intangibles relating to the midlothian laboratories and ecr pharmaceuticals acquisitions of the increase in expenditures for research and development were driven by increased expenditures on externally developed projects 
the company spent  and  in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively  on a product line  outside of its area of expertise  that is being jointly developed with two other generic companies and that require expenditures on a clinical trial 
the clinical trial for this product is ongoing  and the company believes that it will file an anda for one of these products in late fiscal year royalty income includes royalties relating to brometane  a cough and cold product which the company divested in july and income received from outside parties for research performed by the company 
the company also began receiving a small royalty on sales of certain naprelan strengths in january  due to a court hearing upholding the patent and the generic being pulled from the market 
interest income and other income includes a reimbursement from the dealer of  for a loss realized in the prior year  from the sale of an auction rate security 
also  included in other income expense is the  gain on the sale of the related rights to brometane  a cough and cold product which the company divested in july interest income decreased in fiscal  because the company had lower average cash and investment balances and the investments were held in accounts which paid lower rates of interest 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes amounting to of income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended april   compared to a benefit amounting to of the loss before income taxes for the year ended april  the difference in the effective tax rate is mainly due to changes period over period in permanent differences that have a smaller percentage impact on the current period provision

results of operations for years ended april  and revenue change change hi tech generics health care products midlothian laboratories   n a naprelan total net sales of hi tech generic pharmaceutical products  which includes some private label contract manufacturing  decreased due to continued pricing pressure on many of the company s core products offset by new product launches including ciclopirox topical 
table of contents solution   fluticasone proprionate nasal spray  mcg  hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide syrup and oflaxacin otic solution  
these increases were partially offset by decreases in sales of cough and flu products as well as urea based products 
the health care products division  which markets the company s branded products  had lower sales of diabetic tussin due to the discontinuation of children s diabetic tussin at certain retail chains 
these decreases were offset by increases in sales of multibetic and zostrix  including the newly launched zostrix neuropathy product

in april  hi tech divested naprelan 
sales of naprelan in the current year represent inventory sold as part of the divestiture 
cost of sales of sales of sales cost of sales the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is due to decreased unit sales of higher margin branded products  increased unit sales of lower margin products  increased raw material prices and pricing pressure which lowered margins on several generic products 
additionally  raw material and component prices have increased due to the price of oil increasing the costs for plastic bottles  increases in the price of corn and other sweeteners  and the decline of the us dollar which is driving price increases from certain foreign raw material suppliers 
these trends were partially offset by the acquisition of the assets of midlothian laboratories  since  on average  this division has higher gross margins than hi tech s core generic business 
expense items change change selling  general and administrative expense research and product development costs contract research income   n a interest expense interest income and other provision for income tax benefit expense decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses are related to lower legal fees and cost reduction efforts by management

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company s operations are historically financed principally by cash flow from operations 
at april  and april   working capital was approximately  and  respectively 
the increase of  was primarily due to operating income earned during the fiscal year and partial proceeds the company received from selling the rights to its brometane and naprelan products

cash flows provided by operating activities were approximately  which was primarily the result of net income of  plus non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization of  and stock based compensation of  less non operating gains of  for the sale of brometane and  for the reimbursement for an auction rate security 
these inflows were offset by an increase of accounts receivables of  and various other changes in working capital accounts 
the receivables for the company increased primarily because of the increase in sales of  in the quarter 
higher than normal orders in april led to higher receivables levels and lower inventory levels than the company would have expected to have at year end 
additionally  the company experienced slower payments from some customers  which also contributed to the higher levels of receivables 
included in the inventory is approximately  of raw materials  components and finished product for fluticasone propionate nasal spray 
cash flows provided by investing activities were approximately  and were principally due to proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and receipts from the sale of bromatane and naprelan offset by investments in fixed assets and the purchase of the assets of ecr pharmaceuticals

critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses for the reporting period covered thereby 
as a result  these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information that we obtain from our customers and outside sources  and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments which impact our reported operating results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
these assumptions include but are not limited to the percentage of new products which may have chargebacks and the percentage of items which will be subject to price decreases 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note a to our financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable  adjustments for returns and price adjustments  allowance for doubtful accounts and carrying value of inventory represent significant estimates made by management 

table of contents revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue is recognized for product sales upon shipment and when risk is passed to the customer and when estimates of discounts  rebates  promotional adjustments  price adjustments  returns  chargebacks  and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable  collection is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
these estimates are presented in the financial statements as reductions to net revenues and accounts receivable 
estimated sales returns  allowances and discounts are provided for in determining net sales 
contract research income is recognized as work is completed and billable costs are incurred 
in certain cases  contract research income is based on attainment of designated milestones 
adjustments for returns and price adjustments our product revenues are typically subject to agreements with customers allowing chargebacks  rebates  rights of return  pricing adjustments and other allowances 
based on our agreements and contracts with our customers  we calculate adjustments for these items when we recognize revenue and we book the adjustments against accounts receivable and revenue 
chargebacks  primarily from wholesalers  are the most significant of these items 
chargebacks result from arrangements we have with end users establishing prices for products for which the end user independently selects a wholesaler from which to purchase 
a chargeback represents the difference between our invoice price to the wholesaler  which is typically stated at wholesale acquisition cost  and the end customer s contract price  which is lower 
we credit the wholesaler for purchases by end customers at the lower price 
therefore  we record these chargebacks at the time we recognize revenue in connection with our sales to wholesalers 
the reserve for chargebacks is computed in the following manner 
the company obtains wholesaler inventory data for the wholesalers which represent approximately of our chargeback activity 
this inventory is multiplied by the historical percentage of units that are charged back and by the price adjustment per unit to arrive at the chargeback accrual 
this calculation is performed by product by customer 
the calculated amount of chargebacks could be affected by other factors such as a change in retail customer mix a change in negotiated terms with retailers product sales mix at the wholesaler retail inventory levels changes in wholesale acquisition cost wac the company continually monitors the chargeback activity and adjusts the provisions for chargebacks when we believe that the actual chargebacks will differ from our original provisions 
consistent with industry practice  the company maintains a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period 
the company s estimate for returns is based upon its historical experience with actual returns 
while such experience has allowed for reasonable estimation in the past  history may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns 
the company continually monitors its estimates for returns and makes adjustments when it believes that actual product returns may differ from the established accruals 
included in the adjustment for sales allowances and returns is a reserve for credits taken by our customers for rebates  return authorizations and other discounts 
sales discounts are granted for prompt payment 
the reserve for sales discounts is based on invoices outstanding and assumes that of available discounts will be taken 
price adjustments  including shelf stock adjustments  are credits issued from time to time to reflect decreases in the selling prices of our products which our customer has remaining in its inventory at the time of the price reduction 
decreases in our selling prices are discretionary decisions made by us to reflect market conditions 
amounts recorded for estimated price adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers  estimated launch dates of competing products  estimated declines in market price and inventory held by the customer 
the company analyzes this on a case by case basis and makes adjustments to reserves as necessary 
the company adequately reserves for chargebacks  discounts  allowances and returns in the period in which the sales takes place 
no material amounts included in the provision for chargebacks and the provision for sales discounts recorded in the current period relate to sales made in the prior periods 
the provision for sales allowances and returns includes reserves for items sold in the current and prior periods 
the company has substantially and consistently used the same estimating methods 
we have refined the methods as new data became available 
there have been no material differences between the estimates applied and actual results 
the company determines amounts that are material to the financial statements in consideration of all relevant circumstances including quantitative and qualitative factors 
among the items considered is the impact on individual financial statement classification  operating income and footnote disclosures and the degree of precision that is attainable in estimating judgmental items 

table of contents the following table presents the roll forward of each significant estimate  which balances are reflected as deductions from accounts receivable as of april   and and for the years then ended  respectively 
beginning balance may current provision actual credits in current period ending balance april for the year ended april  chargebacks sales discounts sales allowances returns total adjustment for returns price allowances for the year ended april  chargebacks sales discounts sales allowances returns total adjustment for returns price allowances for the year ended april  chargebacks sales discounts sales allowances returns total adjustment for returns price allowances allowance for doubtful accounts we have historically provided credit terms to customers in accordance with what management views as industry norms 
financial terms  for credit approved customers  are generally on either a net or day basis  though most customers are entitled to a prompt payment discount 
management periodically and regularly reviews customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts  considering factors such as economic conditions and each customer s payment history and creditworthiness 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  or if they were otherwise unable to make payments in accordance with management s expectations  we would have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories we state inventories at the lower of average cost or market  with cost being determined based upon the average method 
in evaluating the inventory  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand  estimated time required to sell existing inventory and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
we establish reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories based upon our historical experience  product expiration dates and management s assessment of current product demand 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of april  we are not involved in any material unconsolidated transactions
