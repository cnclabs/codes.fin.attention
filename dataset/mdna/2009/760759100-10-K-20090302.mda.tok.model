item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of our business and consolidated results of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our presence in markets with growing populations throughout the sunbelt  including california  arizona and texas  and in other domestic markets that have experienced higher than average population growth during the past several years  supports our internal growth strategy 
we believe that our presence in these markets positions us to experience growth at rates that are generally higher than the industry s overall growth rate 
we continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by implementing our financial  operating and growth strategies as described below 
financial strategy key components of our financial strategy include our ability to generate free cash flow and sustain or improve our return on invested capital 
our definition of free cash flow  which is not a measure determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe that free cash flow is a driver of shareholder value and provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment  net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment 
it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy  which includes reinvesting in capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service  investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided  maintaining our investment grade ratings and minimizing debt  paying cash dividends and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization 
in addition  free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation 
furthermore  we expect to generate total annual run rate integration synergies  in connection with the merger with allied  of approximately million by the end of  primarily by achieving greater operating efficiencies  capturing inherent economies of scale  and leveraging corporate and overhead resources 
we have identified and are on track to realize million of annual run rate integration benefits by the end of we are confident that we will be able to realize the balance of the targeted million in synergies in the second year following the merger despite the economic slowdown 
consequently  we have developed and implemented incentive programs that help focus our entire company on the realization of key financial metrics of increasing free cash flow  achieving targeted earnings  maintaining and improving returns on invested capital  as well as achieving integration synergies 
the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations 
free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or to which we have committed  such as debt service requirements and dividend payments 
our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

table of contents we manage our free cash flow primarily by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital  which consists primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable 
we have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize shareholder value as well as our return on investment 
this includes the following customer service 
we will continue to reinvest in our existing fleet of vehicles  equipment  landfills and facilities to ensure the highest level of service to our customers and the communities we serve 
we continue to focus on innovative waste disposal processes and programs to help our customers obtain their goals around sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices 
we believe that these in turn will help us achieve profitable growth 
internal growth price growth 
growth through price increases helps ensure that we obtain an adequate return on our substantial capital investment and the business risk associated with such investment 
price increases also allow us to recover historical and current year increases in operating costs  which ultimately enhances our operating margins 
volume growth 
growth through increases in our customer base and services provided is the most capital efficient means for us to build our business 
this includes not only expanding landfill and transfer capacity and investing in trucks and containers  but also includes investing in information tools and training needed to ensure high productivity and quality service throughout all functional areas of our business 
we work to increase collection and disposal volumes while insuring that prices charged for such services provide an appropriate return on our capital investment 
maintain our credit ratings 
we believe that a key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining investment grade ratings on our senior debt  which was rated bbb by standard poor s  bbb by fitch and baa by moody s as of december  such ratings have allowed us  and should continue to allow us  to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 
as such  we intend to continue to use our free cash flow and proceeds from sale of operations to reduce our debt 
dividends 
in july  our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of 
per share 
the dividend has been increased each year thereafter  the latest increase occurring in the third quarter of  representing an average annualized growth rate of approximately 
our current quarterly dividend per share is 
we may consider increasing our quarterly cash dividend if we believe it will enhance shareholder value 
market growth and optimization 
within our markets  our goal is to deliver sustainable  long term profitable growth while efficiently operating our assets to generate acceptable rates of return 
we allocate capital to businesses  markets and development projects to support growth while achieving acceptable rates of return 
we develop previously non permitted  non contiguous landfill sites greenfield landfill sites 
we also expand our existing landfill sites  when possible 
we supplement this organic growth with acquisitions of operating assets  such as landfills  transfer stations  and tuck in acquisitions of collection and disposal operations in existing markets 
we continuously evaluate our existing operating assets and their deployment within each market to determine if we have optimized our position and to ensure appropriate investment of capital 
where operations are not generating acceptable returns  we examine opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies and returns through the integration of additional assets 
if such enhancements are not possible  we may ultimately decide to divest the existing assets and reallocate resources to other markets 
for certain risks related to our financial strategy  see item a 
risk factors 

table of contents operating strategy we seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to increase operating margins and enhance shareholder value 
our operating strategy for accomplishing this goal includes the following utilize the extensive industry knowledge and experience of our executive management team  utilize a decentralized management structure in overseeing day to day operations  integrate waste operations  improve operating margins through economies of scale  cost efficiencies and asset utilization  achieve high levels of customer satisfaction  and utilize business information systems to improve consistency in financial and operational performance 
experienced executive management team 
we believe that we have one of the most experienced executive management teams in the solid waste industry 
james e 
o connor  who has served as our chief executive officer ceo since december  also became our chairman in january he worked at waste management  inc from to and from to during that time  he served in various management positions  including senior vice president in and  and area president of waste management of florida  inc from to mr 
o connor has years of experience in the solid waste industry 
donald w

slager worked for allied from through and served in various management positions  including president coo from through and executive vice president and coo from to from to  mr 
slager served as senior vice president  operations 
he held various management positions at allied from to  and was previously general manager at national waste services  where he served in various management positions since mr

holmes served in various management positions with browning ferris industries  inc  including vice president  investor relations from to  divisional vice president  collection operations from to  divisional vice president and regional controller northern region from to  and divisional vice president and assistant corporate controller from to mr 
holmes has over years of experience in the solid waste industry 
our regional senior vice presidents have an average of years of experience in the industry 
merger integration strategy 
as previously mentioned  on december  we completed our merger with allied 
we believe this merger is different than historical attempts to consolidate the waste industry for a number of reasons including the following two mature companies 
most previous attempts to consolidate the waste industry focused on a roll up strategy often involving relatively young companies solely focused on increasing revenue through acquisitions 
our merger with allied involved two mature companies with similar business practices and performance metrics that have been developed and refined over the course of a number of years 
we believe that the combination of our maturity and proven business practices and performance metrics will be a critical component of our future success 
best practices 
our merger also affords us the opportunity to select the best tools and systems and to adopt the best practices of two successful companies 
republic has a history of financial discipline evident in the consistent generation of increasing levels of free cash flow 
allied is noted for its 
table of contents integrated operations and focus on procurement 
we believe that our merger gives us a unique opportunity to combine the strengths of these two successful organizations and create a best in class waste management company 
timely and focused integration process 
we are acutely aware that previous acquisitions in the waste management and other industries failed because of a lack of focus on integration 
as such  we began to develop our integration process and strategy in june  long before our merger was consummated 
our process identified specific integration related tasks focused on all levels of the organization  especially our individual business units 
we have engaged employees at all levels of the company in this process to develop a detailed integration plan and ensure that each of our employees understands their role in the process 
strong operating platform 
the combination of republic and allied creates a company with a strong  national operating platform 
the foundation of this platform is our large network of disposal sites 
this disposal network provides us with a far stronger vertically integrated operating structure than either company would be able to achieve on its own 
we believe that our improved vertically integrated operations will be a key driver of our future profitability 
complementary operations 
the overlay of our operating locations reflects another compelling attribute of our merger 
we operate complementary geographies 
we also share very similar cultures that are centered on a shared commitment to providing industry leading solid waste and environmental services that exceed our customers highest expectations 
significant synergies 
we have identified approximately million of annual run rate synergies associated with the merger 
these synergies focus on right sizing our combined corporate and field staff 
they also take advantage of our complementary operations which allows us to eliminate duplicative facilities and collection routes 
all of our employees are focused on the achievement of our operating strategies 
in addition  certain employees whose role is considered critical will be incentivized based upon the timely achievement of our synergy goal 
we believe that such incentives help to further focus our management team on increasing shareholder value 
strong capital structure 
unlike many other mergers or acquisitions in the waste management and other industries  republic services enjoys a strong capital structure and investment grade credit ratings post merger 
our combination with allied creates a company that will produce substantial annual free cash flow 
this strong cash producing characteristic will allow us to pursue our mission of increasing shareholder value by focusing on investing in our business  paying down our debt and funding dividends 
decentralized management structure 
we maintain a relatively small corporate headquarters staff  relying on a decentralized management structure to minimize administrative overhead costs and to manage our day to day operations more efficiently 
our local management has extensive industry experience in growing  operating and managing solid waste companies and has substantial experience in their local geographic markets 
each regional management team includes a senior vice president of operations  vice president controller  vice president of human resources  vice president of sales  vice president of operations support  director of safety  director of engineering and environmental management  and director of market planning and development 
we believe that our strong regional management teams allow us to more effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout our organization 
our regional management teams and our area presidents have extensive authority  responsibility and autonomy for operations within their respective geographic markets 
compensation for our area management teams is primarily based on the improvement in operating income produced and the free cash flow and return on invested capital generated in each manager s geographic area of responsibility 
in addition  through long term incentive programs  including stock options  we believe we have one of the lowest turnover levels in the industry for our local management teams 
as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities  we are proactive in anticipating our customers needs and adjusting to changes in our markets 
we also seek to implement the best practices of our various regions and areas throughout our operations to improve operating margins 

table of contents integrated operations 
we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through disposal 
we expect that our fully integrated markets generally will have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our non integrated markets 
through acquisitions  landfill operating agreements and other market development activities  we create market specific  integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection companies  transfer stations and landfills 
we consider acquiring companies that own or operate landfills with significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels of waste volume 
we also seek to acquire solid waste collection companies in markets in which we own or operate landfills 
in addition  we generate internal growth in our disposal operations by developing new landfills and expanding our existing landfills from time to time in markets in which we have significant collection operations or in markets that we determine lack sufficient disposal capacity 
during december  subsequent to our acquisition of allied  approximately of the total volume of waste that we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate 
in a number of our larger markets  we and our competitors are required to take waste to government controlled disposal facilities 
this provides us with an opportunity to effectively compete in these markets without investing in landfill capacity 
because we do not have landfill facilities or government controlled disposal facilities for all markets in which we provide collection services  we believe that through landfill and transfer station acquisitions  operating agreements  and market development  we have the opportunity to increase our waste internalization rate and further integrate our operations 
by further integrating operations in existing markets through acquisitions  operating agreements and development of landfills and transfer stations  we may be able to reduce our disposal costs 
economies of scale  cost efficiencies and asset utilization 
we continue to identify and implement best practices throughout our organization with the goal of permanently improving overall operating and financial results 
these best practice initiatives focus on critical areas of our operations such as landfill operations  truck routing  maintenance and related service efficiencies  purchasing and administrative activities 
the consolidation of acquired businesses into existing operations reduces costs by decreasing capital and expenses used for truck routing  personnel  equipment and vehicle maintenance  inventories and back office administration 
generally  we consolidate our acquired administrative centers to reduce our general and administrative costs 
of particular benefit are the opportunities associated with the blending of operations as a result of the allied merger 
scheduled for completion by early  these markets offer the potential for marked improvement in operating results 
generally speaking  there are significant opportunities in these markets to leverage economies of scale and the existing asset base  while realizing improved operating efficiencies 
upon the completion of the integration of allied  our goal is to maintain our selling  general and administrative costs at no more than of revenue  which we believe is appropriate given our existing business platform 
in addition  our procurement initiatives ensure that we negotiate the best volume discounts for goods and services purchased  including waste disposal rates at landfills operated by third parties 
furthermore  we have taken steps to maximize the utilization of our assets 
for example  to reduce the number of collection vehicles and maximize the efficiency of our fleet and drivers  we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operating density 
by using assets more efficiently  operating expenses can be reduced 
high levels of customer satisfaction 
we strive to provide the highest level of service to our customer base 
our policy is to periodically visit each commercial account to ensure customer satisfaction and to verify that we are providing the appropriate level of service 
in addition to visiting existing customers  a salesperson develops a base of prospective customers within each market 
we also have municipal marketing representatives in most service areas that are responsible for working with each municipality or community to which we provide residential service to ensure customer satisfaction 
additionally  the municipal representatives organize and drive the effort to obtain new or renew municipal contracts in their service areas 
focus on systems utilization 
we continue to invest in the integration and expansion of our information systems and technology platform 
our future platform will consist of best in class 
table of contents legacy systems from both republic and allied 
our initiatives will include customer relationship management  billing  productivity  maintenance  general ledger and human resource systems 
we believe that the combination of these systems will prove to be a competitive advantage for our company 
for certain risks related to our operating strategy  see item a 
risk factors 
growth strategy our growth strategy focuses on increasing revenue  gaining market share and enhancing shareholder value through internal growth and acquisitions 
we manage our growth strategy as follows internal growth 
our internal growth strategy focuses on retaining existing customers and obtaining commercial  municipal and industrial customers through our well managed sales and marketing activities 
pricing activities 
we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs  to improve our operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills 
during  we continued to secure broad based price increases across all lines of our business to offset various escalating capital and operating costs 
price increases will remain a major component of our overall future operating strategy 
long term contracts 
we seek to obtain long term contracts for collecting solid waste in markets with growing populations 
these include exclusive franchise agreements with municipalities as well as commercial and industrial contracts 
by obtaining such long term agreements  we have the opportunity to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the underlying population growth in these markets 
we believe it is important to have secured exclusive  long term franchise agreements in market areas in some of the fastest growing states according to the us census bureau  for example  arizona  texas and california 
we believe that this positions us to experience internal growth rates that are generally higher than our industry s overall growth rate 
in addition  we believe that by securing a base of long term recurring revenue in growing population markets  we are better able to protect our market position from competition and our business may be less susceptible to downturns in economic conditions 
sales and marketing activities 
we seek to manage our sales and marketing activities to enable us to capitalize on our leading position in many of the markets in which we operate 
we provide a national accounts program in response to the needs of our national clients  centralizing services to effectively manage their needs  such as minimizing their procurement costs 
we currently have approximately  sales and marketing employees in the field who are compensated using a commission structure that is focused on generating high levels of quality revenue 
for the most part  these employees directly solicit business from existing and prospective commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
we emphasize our rate and cost structures when we train new and existing sales personnel 
in addition  we utilize a customer relationship management system that assists our sales people in tracking leads 
it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial  industrial and franchise contracts 
development activities 
we seek to identify opportunities to further our position as an integrated service provider in markets where we provide services for a portion of the waste stream 
where appropriate  we seek to obtain permits to build transfer stations and landfills that would provide vertically integrated waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites 
development projects  while generally less capital intensive  typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success 
we undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available 
acquisition growth 
we look to acquire businesses that complement our existing business platform 
our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on privately held solid waste companies and the waste operations of municipal and other local governmental authorities 
we believe that our ability to 
table of contents acquire privately held companies is enhanced by increasing competition in the solid waste industry  increasing capital requirements as a result of changes in solid waste regulatory requirements  and the limited number of exit strategies for these privately held companies owners and principals 
we also seek to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities that are privatizing  as they seek to increase available capital and reduce risk 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities that are being divested by other publicly owned waste companies 
in sum  our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on the following acquiring privately held businesses that position us for growth in existing and new markets  acquiring well managed companies and  when appropriate  retaining local management  and acquiring operations and facilities from municipalities that are privatizing and publicly owned companies that are divesting of assets 
we also seek to acquire landfills  transfer stations and collection companies that operate in markets that we are already servicing in order to fully integrate our operations from collection to disposal 
in addition  we have in the past and may continue in the future to exchange businesses with other solid waste companies if by doing so there is a net benefit to our business platform 
these activities allow us to increase our revenue and market share  lower our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue  and consolidate duplicative facilities and functions to maximize cost efficiencies and economies of scale 
on december   we completed our merger with allied 
we expect to achieve total annual run rate integration synergies  primarily relating to operating efficiencies  inherent economies of scale  and leveraging corporate and overhead resources of approximately million by the end of we have identified and are on track to realize in approximately million  or  of the total expected annual run rate synergies 
for certain risks related to our growth strategy  see item a 
risk factors 
operations our operations primarily consist of the collection  transfer and disposal of non hazardous solid waste 
collection services 
we provide solid waste collection services to commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers through collection companies 
in  of our revenue was derived from collection services 
within the collection line of business  of our revenue is from services provided to municipal and residential customers  is from services provided to commercial customers  and is from services provided to industrial and other customers 
our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills 
residential solid waste collection services are typically performed under contracts with municipalities  which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in their respective jurisdictions 
these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years  although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods 
residential solid waste collection services may also be performed on a subscription basis  in which individual households contract directly with us 
the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors  frequency and type of service  the distance to the disposal facility and cost of disposal 
in general  subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service 
in our commercial and industrial collection operations  we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes 
we also rent compactors to large waste generators 
commercial collection services are generally performed under one to three year service agreements  and fees are determined by considerations such as market factors  collection frequency  type of equipment furnished  the type and volume or weight of the waste collected  the distance to the disposal facility  and the cost of disposal 

table of contents we also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer 
our construction services are provided to the commercial construction and home building sectors 
we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to a landfill or a transfer station for disposal 
we also provide recycling services in certain markets in compliance with local laws or the terms of our franchise agreements 
these services include the curbside collection of residential recyclable waste and the provision of a variety of recycling services to commercial and industrial customers 
transfer and disposal services 
we own or operate transfer stations 
we deposit waste at these transfer stations  as do other private haulers and municipal haulers  for compaction and transfer to trailers for transport to disposal sites or recycling facilities 
as of december   we owned or operated active landfills  which had approximately  permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately billion in place cubic yards 
the in place capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors  requirements of regulatory authorities  our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations  and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites 
some of our landfills accept non hazardous special waste  including utility ash  asbestos and contaminated soils 
most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage 
we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices  market needs  remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion 
to satisfy future disposal demand  we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills 
however  no assurances can be made that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 
we also have responsibility for closed landfills  for which we have associated closure and post closure liabilities 
recycling facilities and other services 
we own or operate materials recovery facilities and other recycling operations 
these facilities sort recyclable paper  aluminum  glass and other materials 
most of these recyclable materials are internally collected by our residential collection operations 
in some areas  we receive commercial and industrial solid waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable materials and non recyclable waste 
the recyclable materials are salvaged  repackaged and sold to third parties  and the non recyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or incinerators 
sales and marketing we seek to provide quality services that will enable us to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction 
we derive our business from a broad customer base  which we believe will enable us to experience stable growth 
we focus our marketing efforts on continuing and expanding business with existing customers  as well as attracting new customers 
we employ approximately  sales and marketing employees 
our sales and marketing strategy is to provide high quality  comprehensive solid waste collection  recycling  transfer and disposal services to our customers at competitive prices 
we target potential customers of all sizes  from small quantity generators to large fortune companies and municipalities 
most of our marketing activity is local in nature 
however  we also provide a national accounts program in response to the needs of some of our national and regional customers 
our national accounts program is designed to provide the best total solution to our customers evolving waste management needs in an environmentally responsible manner 
we partner with our national clients to reach their sustainability goals  optimize waste streams  balance equipment and service intervals and provide customized reporting 
the national accounts program centralizes services to effectively manage customer needs  while helping minimize procurement costs 
with our extended geographic reach  our national program 
table of contents effectively serves states and puerto rico 
as industry leaders  our mission is to utilize our strengths and expertise to exceed customer expectations by consistently delivering the best national program available 
we generally do not change the tradenames of the local businesses we acquire  and therefore we do not operate nationally under any one mark or tradename 
customers we provide services to commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
no one customer has individually accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 
competition we operate in a highly competitive industry 
entry into our business and the ability to operate profitably in the industry requires substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience 
competition in the non hazardous solid waste industry comes from a few large  national publicly owned companies  including waste management  inc waste  several regional publicly and privately owned solid waste companies  and thousands of small privately owned companies 
in any given market  competitors may have larger operations and greater resources 
in addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies  we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations 
these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and tax exempt financing 
we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services 
from time to time  our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract 
our ability to increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by the pricing policies of our competitors 
this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 
seasonality and severe weather our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation  delay the collection and disposal of waste  reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites  or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 
regulation our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal  state and local requirements that regulate the environment  public health  safety  zoning and land use 
operating and other permits  licenses and other approvals are generally required for landfills and transfer stations  certain solid waste collection vehicles  fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate  and these permits are subject to revocation  modification and renewal in certain circumstances 
federal  state and local laws and regulations vary  but generally govern wastewater or stormwater discharges  air emissions  the handling  transportation  treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous and non hazardous waste  and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances 
these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement  which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits  obtain injunctions  or impose fines or penalties in the case of violations  including criminal penalties 
the us environmental protection agency epa and various other federal  state and local environmental  public and occupational health and safety agencies and authorities administer these regulations 
we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
however  in the existing climate of heightened environmental concerns  from time to time  we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work 
table of contents and related activities at various landfills and other facilities 
there is no assurance that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory compliance efforts 
we have established final capping  closure  post closure and remediation liabilities that we believe  based on currently available information  will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs 
however  we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 
federal regulation 
the following summarizes the primary environmental  public and occupational health and safety related statutes of the united states that affect our facilities and operations the solid waste disposal act  as amended  including the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
rcra establishes a framework for regulating the handling  transportation  treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous and non hazardous solid waste  and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills 
subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste 
regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines  including location restrictions  facility design and operating criteria  final capping  closure and post closure requirements  financial assurance standards  groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards  many of which had not commonly been in effect or enforced in the past in connection with municipal solid waste landfills 
each state was required to submit to the epa a permit program designed to implement subtitle d regulations by april  all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d 
these state permit programs may include landfill requirements which are more stringent than those of subtitle d 
our failure to comply with the environmental requirements of federal  state and local authorities at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit 
all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements 
operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations 
compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla 
cercla  among other things  provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
cercla may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of a site  parties who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of  parties who transported the hazardous substances to a site and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at a site 
under the authority of cercla and its implementing regulations  detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment 
liability under cercla is not dependent on the existence or disposal of only hazardous wastes but can also be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than substances characterized by the epa as hazardous  many of which may be found in common household waste 
among other things  cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order or offer an opportunity to persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so 
in addition  the epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 
liability under cercla is not dependent on the intentional disposal of hazardous waste 
it can be founded upon the release or threatened release  even as a result of unintentional  non negligent or lawful action  of thousands of hazardous substances  including very small quantities of such 
table of contents substances 
thus  even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous waste as such  it is possible that one or more hazardous substances may have been deposited or released at landfills or other properties owned by third parties where we have transported to and disposed of waste or at our landfills or at other properties which we currently own or operate or may have owned or operated 
therefore  we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources  even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them 
the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive 
given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability  such liability could have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the federal water pollution control act of  as amended the clean water act 
this act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources  including solid waste disposal sites  into streams  rivers and other waters of the united states 
point source runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters must be covered by discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling and monitoring  and  under certain circumstances  reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges 
storm water discharge regulations under the clean water act require a permit for certain construction activities and discharges from industrial operations and facilities  which may affect our operations 
if a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly owned treatment works  the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment works 
in addition  states may adopt groundwater protection programs under the clean water act or the safe drinking water act that could affect solid waste landfills 
furthermore  development which alters or affects wetlands must generally be permitted prior to such development commencing  and certain mitigation requirements may be required by the permitting agencies 
the clean air act  as amended the clean air act 
the clean air act imposes limitations on emissions from various sources  including landfills 
in march  the epa promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems 
these regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction  reconstruction or modification on or after may   and  principally  to landfills that can accommodate million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste 
the regulations apply whether the landfill is active or closed 
the date by which each affected landfill is required to have a gas collection and control system installed and made operational varies depending on calculated emission rates at the landfill 
many state regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems for the collection and control of certain landfill gas 
the occupational safety and health act of  as amended osha 
osha authorizes the occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor to promulgate occupational safety and health standards 
a number of these standards  including standards for notices of hazardous chemicals and the handling of asbestos  apply to our facilities and operations 
state and local regulation 
each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal  water and air pollution  and  in most cases  releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters 
states also have adopted regulations governing the design  operation  maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations 
some counties  municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations 
our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements 
in addition  our solid waste collection and landfill operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring the development of solid waste reduction and recycling programs 
for example  several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce  through solid waste planning  composting  recycling or other programs  the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills 
additionally  laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills  including yard waste  newspapers  beverage containers  unshredded tires  lead acid batteries and household appliances  have been promulgated in several states and are being considered in others 
legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also are or have been under consideration by the us congress and the epa  respectively 

table of contents in order to construct  expand and operate a landfill  one or more construction or operating permits  as well as zoning and land use approvals  must be obtained 
these permits and approvals may be difficult and time consuming to obtain and to operate in compliance with  are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens groups  may be subject to periodic renewal  and are subject to modification  non renewal and revocation by the issuing agency 
in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills  it may be and on occasion has been necessary for us to expend considerable time  effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 
many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks which are generally used to store petroleum based products 
these tanks are generally subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing  upgrading  closure and removal  and that  in the event of leaks  require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated 
we believe that all of our underground storage tanks currently meet all applicable regulations 
if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak  we could be liable for response costs and  if the leakage migrates onto the property of others  we could be liable for damages to third parties 
we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
finally  with regard to our solid waste transportation operations  we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration  office of motor carriers  and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters 
various states and local government authorities have enacted or promulgated  or are considering enacting or promulgating  laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state  county  or other jurisdiction lines 
in  the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of out of state solid waste was unconstitutional  however  states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling 
in  the supreme court ruled that a flow control law  which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation  imposed an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce  and  therefore  was unconstitutional 
in  the supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publicly owned waste facility 
a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries 
other governments may enact similar regulations in the future 
these regulations may  in some cases  cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal  thereby adversely affecting our operations 
we have established liabilities for landfill and environmental costs  which include landfill site final capping  closure and post closure costs 
we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and adjust our rates used to expense final capping  closure and post closure costs accordingly 
based on current information and regulatory requirements  we believe that our liabilities recorded for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate 
however  environmental laws may change  and there can be no assurance that our recorded liabilities will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations  future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations  or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us 
liability insurance and bonding the nature of our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations  including possible damages to the environment 
such potential liabilities could involve  for example  claims for remediation costs  personal injury  property damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful materials  claims of employees  customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations  or claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work 
we could also be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements 
because 
table of contents of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages  liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant 
our solid waste operations have third party environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations  subject to certain limitations and exclusions 
however  we cannot assure you that such environmental liability insurance would be adequate  in scope or amount  in the event of a major loss  nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive 
we have general liability  vehicle liability  employment practices liability  pollution liability  directors and officers liability  workers compensation and employer s liability coverage  as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies 
we also carry property insurance 
although we try to operate safely and prudently and while we have  subject to limitations and exclusions  substantial liability insurance  no assurance can be given that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our insurance programs for workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured 
claims in excess of self insurance levels are fully insured subject to policy limits 
accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported 
due to the variable condition of the insurance market  we have experienced  and may continue to experience in the future  increased self insurance retention levels and increased premiums 
as we assume more risk for self insurance through higher retention levels  we may experience more variability in our self insurance reserves and expense 
in the normal course of business  we may be required to post performance bonds  insurance policies  letters of credit  or cash or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts  the operation  closure or post closure of landfills  environmental remediation  environmental permits  and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance 
to date  we have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or by obtaining bank letters of credit  insurance policies or surety bonds 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  full time employees  approximately of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
from time to time  our operating locations may experience union organizing efforts 
we have not historically experienced any significant work stoppages 
we currently have no disputes or bargaining circumstances that we believe could cause significant disruptions in our business 
our management believes that we have good relations with our employees 
compensation we believe that our compensation program effectively aligns our field and corporate management team with our overall goal of generating increasing amounts of free cash flow while achieving targeted earnings and returns on invested capital 
this is done by utilizing simple and measurable metrics on which incentive pay is based 
at the field level  these metrics are based on free cash flow  earnings and return on invested capital for each manager s geographic area of responsibility 
great effort is taken to ensure that these goals agree with our overall goals 
incentive compensation at the corporate level is based on the obtainment of our overall goals 
furthermore  in conjunction with the merger with allied  we have developed integration metrics to be achieved by our executive management team and key employees based upon targeted annual run rate synergies of approximately million by the end of in addition  certain field and corporate employees also participate in a long term incentive program 
we believe this program aligns our short and long term goals and helps ensure that our long term success is not sacrificed for the obtainment of short term goals

we may experience difficulties integrating allied s business 
achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger with allied will depend significantly on whether we can integrate allied s business in an efficient and effective manner 
although republic and allied were able to conduct some planning regarding the integration of the two companies prior to the merger  we might not have determined the exact nature of how the businesses and operations of the two companies will be combined after the merger 
the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses  and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized 
we may not be able to accomplish the integration process smoothly  successfully or on a timely basis 
the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations  information systems and facilities  and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds  corporate cultures and management philosophies  may increase the difficulties of integration 
we and allied operate numerous systems and controls  including those 
table of contents involving information management  purchasing  accounting and finance  sales  billing  employee benefits  payroll and regulatory compliance 
the integration of operations following the merger will require the dedication of significant management and external resources  which may temporarily distract management s attention from our day to day business and be costly 
employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may also disrupt our business 
the inability of our management to successfully and timely integrate the operations of republic and allied could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company 
we may not realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits from the merger with allied fully or within the timing anticipated 
we entered into the merger agreement with allied because we believe that the merger will be beneficial to our stockholders primarily as a result of the anticipated synergies resulting from the combined operations 
we may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or the long term strategic benefits of the merger fully or within the timing anticipated 
for example  elimination of duplicative costs may not be fully achieved or may take longer than anticipated 
for at least the first year after an acquisition  and possibly longer  the benefits from the acquisition will be offset by the costs incurred in integrating the businesses and operations 
the inability to realize the full extent of  or any of  the anticipated synergies or other benefits of the merger  or our encountering delays in the integration process which may delay the timing of such synergies or other benefits  could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
future expenses resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting may adversely affect the market value of our common stock following the merger 
in accordance with gaap  we are considered the acquirer of allied for accounting purposes 
we have accounted for the merger using the purchase method of accounting 
there may be future expenses related to the acquisition that are required to be recorded in our earnings that could adversely affect the market value of our common stock following the completion of the merger 
under the purchase method of accounting  we have allocated the total purchase price to the assets including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired from allied based on their fair values as of the effective date of the merger  and we have recorded the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill 
for certain tangible and intangible assets  and for our capping  closure and post closure asset retirement obligations  revaluing them to their fair values as of the merger completion date will result in additional depreciation  depletion and amortization and accretion expense that will exceed the combined amounts recorded by republic and allied prior to the merger 
interest expense will increase significantly as a result of revaluing allied s debt and other long term liabilities  including  for example  self insurance reserves and environmental liabilities 
in addition  as discussed in the following risk factor  to the extent the value of goodwill or other intangible assets were to become impaired after the merger  we may incur material non cash charges to our results of operations 
our goodwill and other intangible assets may become impaired  which could result in material non cash charges to our results of operations 
we have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from the merger with allied 
at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the carrying value as defined by gaap  we evaluate this goodwill for impairment based on the fair values of each of our operating segments 
the estimated fair value of our operating segments could change if there are changes in our capital structure  cost of debt  interest rates  capital expenditure levels  operating cash flows or market capitalization  or in general economic conditions 
impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets could require material non cash charges to our results of operations 

table of contents we may incur significant unexpected transaction and integration related costs in connection with the merger 
we have incurred and may continue to incur costs associated with combining the operations of republic and allied  including charges and payments to some employees pursuant to change in control contractual obligations 
the substantial majority of these expenses resulting from the merger are comprised of transaction costs related to the merger  facilities and systems consolidation costs  and employee related costs 
additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies businesses or may result from the application of purchase accounting used to effectuate the merger 
the elimination of duplicative costs  as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses  may not offset incremental transaction and other integration related costs in the near term 
the timing of and proceeds received from the mandatory divestiture of certain assets of the company may result in additional expenditures of money and resources or reduce the benefit of the merger 
completion of the merger is predicated on divesting of certain assets as required by the antitrust division of the doj under the hsr act 
in february  we announced an agreement with waste connections  inc to sell them a majority of the assets we are required to divest 
the assets being divested to waste connections include six municipal solid waste landfills  six collection operations and three transfer stations across seven markets 
this transaction is subject to closing conditions regarding due diligence  regulatory approval and other customary matters 
closing is expected to occur in the second quarter of however  the timing of and proceeds we will receive from the divestiture to waste connections and the divestiture of the remaining assets as required by the doj cannot be predicted 
delays in divesting of these assets may result in additional expenditures of money and resources which would reduce the financial benefit we expect from the merger 
in addition  the amount of proceeds received from such divestitures cannot be guaranteed 
an unanticipated shortfall in proceeds may limit our ability to execute our financial strategy  including repaying our debt 
we have substantial indebtedness as a result of the merger  which may limit our financial flexibility 
as of december   we have approximately billion in total debt outstanding 
this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business  to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases  to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry  and to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants of our debt instruments 
further  our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control 
if we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions  we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures  reducing dividends  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt  or seeking additional equity capital 
the downturn in the us economy may have an adverse impact on our operating results 
a weak economy generally results in decreases in the volumes of waste generated 
in the past  weakness in the us economy has had a negative effect on our operating results  including decreases in revenue and operating cash flows 
previous economic slowdowns have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing the manufacturing and construction industries and our proceeds from sales of recycled commodities 
as a result of the global economic crisis  we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and customer turnover as well 
there can be no assurance that worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
further  there can be no assurance that an improvement in economic conditions will result in an immediate  if at all positive  improvement in our results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents the downturn in the us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies  large national accounts and others 
the weak us economy has reduced the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies 
we provide services to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities 
these governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us 
in addition  the weak economy may cause other customers  including our large national accounts  to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us 
this could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
the downturn in the us economy and in the financial markets could expose us to counter party risk associated with our derivatives 
to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in various commodities and interest rates  we have entered into a number of derivative agreements 
these derivative agreements require us or the counter party to such agreements to make payments to the other party if the price of certain commodities or interest rates exceed a specified amount 
a continued downturn in the us economy or in the financial markets could adversely impact the financial stability of the counter parties with which we do business  potentially limiting their ability to fulfill their obligations under our derivative agreements 
this could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources  flexibility to reduce prices and other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 
we principally compete with large national waste management companies  municipalities and numerous regional and local companies for collection and disposal accounts 
competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services 
competition for landfill business is primarily based on disposal costs  geographic location and quality of operations 
some of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than us 
many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or tax exempt financing 
our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills may also be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste 
in markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill  our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors 
as a result of these factors  we may have difficulty competing effectively from time to time or in certain markets 
if we were to lower prices to address these competitive issues  it could negatively impact our revenue growth and profitability 
price increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 
we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of services 
in addition  we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs including fuel costs  to improve operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills 
from time to time  our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand their market share 
contractual  general economic or market specific conditions may also limit our ability to raise prices 
as a result of these factors  we may be unable to offset increases in costs  improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases 
we may also lose volume to lower cost competitors 
increases in the cost of fuel or oil will increase our operating expenses  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover fuel or oil cost increases from our customers 
our operations are dependent on fuel to run our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection  transfer  and disposal 
we buy fuel in the open market 
fuel prices are unpredictable and can 
table of contents fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control  including geopolitical developments  actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries  and other oil and gas producers  supply and demand for oil and gas  war  terrorism and unrest in oil producing countries  and regional production patterns 
we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel surcharges 
for example  our fuel costs were million in  representing of our cost of operations compared to million in  representing of our cost of operations 
this increase primarily reflects an increase in the price of fuel 
in addition  regulations affecting the type of fuel our trucks use are changing and could materially increase the cost and consumption of our fuel 
our operations also require the use of certain petroleum based products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of oil 
an increase in the price of oil could increase the cost of those products  which would increase our operating and capital costs 
we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our vendors 
fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our revenue  operating income and cash flows 
we process recyclable materials such as paper  cardboard  plastics  aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties 
our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials 
the resale and purchase prices of  and market demand for  recyclable materials can be volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control 
these fluctuations may affect our future revenue  operating income and cash flows 
adverse weather conditions may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 
our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather  which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation  may interfere with collection and landfill operations  delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers 
in addition  weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations  which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 
we currently have matters pending with the doj and internal revenue service irs  which could result in large cash expenditures and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cash flows 
as a result of the merger with allied  we are currently under examination by the irs with regard to allied s federal income tax returns for tax years through an allied subsidiary  browning ferris industries  llc bfi  f k a browning ferris industries  inc  currently has a tax matter in litigation for the tax years ended september  through july  related to a capital loss deduction 
a portion of this loss was subsequently carried forward to allied s through tax years 
we are currently engaged in two refund suits related to this matter 
the bfi tax years september  through july  are currently before the us court of federal claims  while the allied tax year ended december  is currently before the us district court of arizona 
all future tax years impacted by the bfi capital loss deduction and subsequent carryforward by allied are presently in various stages of the irs examination or appeals process 
any resolution or final determination on the merits for an earlier tax year will also resolve the issue for all subsequent periods 
during its examination of allied s tax year  the irs asserted that a redemption of four partnership interests in waste to energy businesses should have been recharacterized as disguised sale transactions 
this issue is currently before the appeals division of the irs 
for both of the matters described above  the potential tax and interest through december  to the extent unpaid has been fully reserved for in our consolidated balance sheet 
a disallowance would not 
table of contents materially affect our consolidated results of operations  however  a deficiency payment would adversely impact our cash flow in the period the payment was made 
in addition  for the capital loss deduction matter described above  the potential penalty and penalty related interest through december  has also been fully reserved for in our consolidated balance sheet 
the successful assertion by the irs of penalty and penalty related interest in this matter would not materially affect our consolidated results of operations  however  a payment of penalty and penalty related interest would adversely impact our cash flows in the period such payment was made 
the accrual of additional interest charges through the time these matters are resolved will affect our consolidated results of operations 
in addition  the successful assertion by the irs of penalty and penalty related interest in connection with allied s exchange of partnership interests could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  during its examination of allied s through tax years  the irs proposed that certain landfill costs be allocated to the collection and control of methane gas that is naturally emitted from landfills 
the irs position is that the methane gas emitted by a landfill constitutes a joint product resulting from landfill operations and  therefore  associated costs should not be expensed until the methane gas is sold or otherwise disposed 
we believe we have several meritorious defenses  including the fact that methane gas is not actively produced for sale by us but rather arises naturally in the context of providing disposal services 
therefore  we believe that the resolution of this issue will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
for additional information on these matters  see note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
other matters may also arise in the course of tax audits that could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be unable to execute our financial strategy 
our ability to execute our financial strategy is dependent on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt 
the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future 
our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected should we fail to maintain investment grade ratings 
our financial strategy is also dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business  fund internal growth  acquire other solid waste businesses  pay dividends  reduce indebtedness and minimize borrowings  and take other actions to enhance shareholder value 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing our broad based pricing program  that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy  that we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate or that we will be able to increase the amount of such dividends 
a downgrade in our bond ratings could adversely affect our liquidity by increasing the cost of debt and financial assurance instruments 
while downgrades of our bond ratings may not have an immediate impact on our cost of debt or liquidity  they may impact our cost of debt and liquidity over the near to medium term 
if the rating agencies downgrade our debt  this may increase the interest rate we must pay to issue new debt  and it may even make it prohibitively expensive for us to issue new debt 
if our debt ratings are downgraded  future access to financial assurance markets at a reasonable cost  or at all  also may be adversely impacted 

table of contents the solid waste industry is a capital intensive industry and the amount we spend on capital expenditures may exceed current expectations  which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 
our ability to remain competitive and to grow and expand our operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital 
if our capital efficiency programs are unable to offset the impact of inflation and business growth  it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend 
additionally  if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations  the amount we expend on capital  capping  closure  post closure and environmental remediation expenditures will increase 
our cash needs will also increase if the expenditures for capping  closure  post closure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates  which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal  state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control 
increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 
further  federal regulations have tightened the emission standards on class a vehicles  which includes the collection vehicles we purchase 
as a result  we could experience an increase in capital costs and a reduction in operating efficiency 
this could also cause an increase in vehicle operating costs 
we may reduce the number of vehicles we purchase until manufacturers adopt the new standards to increase efficiency 
we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills  which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain or maintain the permits we require to operate our business because permits to operate non hazardous solid waste landfills and to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain 
permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning  environmental and other regulations 
these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures 
local communities and citizen groups  adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need  allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject  or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage 
responding to these challenges has  at times  increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities 
in addition  failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities  maintaining permits for our facilities or expanding existing facilities 
our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our non hazardous solid waste landfills could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our landfills  either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 
the waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation  and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations  increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 
if we inadequately accrue for landfill capping  closure and post closure costs  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
a landfill must be closed and capped  and post closure maintenance commenced once the permitted capacity of the landfill is reached and additional capacity is not authorized 
we have significant financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs at our existing owned or operated landfills  and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated disposal facilities 
we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping  closure and post closure financial obligations 
we could underestimate such accruals  and our financial obligations for capping  closure or post closure costs could exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose 
such a shortfall could result in significant 
table of contents unanticipated charges to income 
additionally  if a landfill is required to be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason  the accruals for capping  closure and post closure could be required to be accelerated  which could have a material adverse impact our results of operations and cash flows 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to operate our landfills at currently estimated volumes due to the use of alternatives to landfill disposal caused by state requirements or voluntary initiatives 
most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning  composting and recycling  or other programs 
some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes  such as yard waste  at landfills 
although such actions are useful in protecting our environment  these actions  as well as voluntary private initiatives by customers to reduce waste or seek disposal alternatives  have and may in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills in certain areas 
if this occurs  there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current estimated volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for such services 
the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects  expansion projects or pending acquisitions not being completed or certain other events could result in a material charge to income 
we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development  expansion and other projects 
if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired  or a development or expansion project is not completed or is determined to be impaired  we will charge any unamortized capitalized expenditures to income relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale  transfer or otherwise 
in future periods  we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy  or other events may cause impairments 
such charges could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flow control regulations that may affect our operating margins  restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 
complying with laws and regulations governing the use  treatment  storage  transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials  air quality  water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly 
laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations 
in addition  environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping  closure and post closure  and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 
our collection  transfer  and landfill operations are  and may in the future continue to be  affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state  county or other jurisdictional lines 
such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations  we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who may allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations  or who assert claims alleging environmental damage  personal injury or property damage 
as a result  we may be required to pay fines or implement corrective measures  or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked 
a significant judgment 
table of contents against us  the loss of a significant permit or license  or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with our environmental obligations 
we could underestimate such accruals and remediation costs could exceed amounts accrued 
such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 
we may have potential environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance 
changes in insurance markets may also impact our financial results 
we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations 
we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage 
if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage  our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability 
this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
also  due to the variable condition of the insurance market  we may experience future increases in self insurance levels as a result of increased retention levels and increased premiums 
as we assume more risk for self insurance through higher retention levels  we may experience more variability in our self insurance reserves and expense 
despite our efforts  we may incur additional hazardous substances liability in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 
we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla  which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict  joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance  on parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substance s was disposed of  and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility ie  generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site 
hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under cercla and their presence  even in minute amounts  can result in substantial liability 
notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances  we may have additional liability under cercla or similar laws in excess of our current reserves because such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills  or in waste collected  transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired 
actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these purposes  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences  including judgments or settlements 
we are  and from time to time become  involved in lawsuits  regulatory inquiries  and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business 
many of these matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities 
the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain 
additionally  the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements  either of which could require substantial payments  adversely affecting our results of operations and cash flows 
we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 
our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial  operational and management resources 
in order to continue our growth  we may need to add administrative and other personnel  and will need to make additional investments in operations and systems 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel  or do so on a timely basis  or expand our operations and systems to the extent  and in the time  required 

table of contents we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 
our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate acquired operations into our business 
the consolidation of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management 
in addition  competition among our competitors for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates 
as such  we cannot assure you that desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified  we will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified  we will effectively consolidate companies we acquire  or any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings 
if any of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our growth strategy  our growth prospects could be adversely affected 
businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 
in pursuing our acquisition strategy  our investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the acquisition candidates 
if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental  remediation or contractual  as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities 
we expect to try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by obtaining indemnification from each of the sellers of the acquired companies  by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain indemnifications or that they will be enforceable  collectible or sufficient in amount  scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 
our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions made by management 
actual results could differ from these amounts 
significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgements about matters that are inherently uncertain include the carrying value of long lived assets  the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs  accruals for final capping  closure and post closure costs  valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets  liabilities for potential litigation  claims and assessments  and liabilities for environmental remediation  employee benefit and pension plans  deferred taxes  uncertain tax positions and self insurance 
there can be no assurance that the liabilities recorded for landfill and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the requirements of existing environmental regulations  future changes to or interpretations of existing regulations  or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to management 
the introduction of new accounting rules  laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations 
complying with new accounting rules  laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations or funding requirements  or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods 

table of contents we may be subject to workforce influences  including work stoppages  which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 
as of december   approximately of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions 
if  in the future  our unionized workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized  our business and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 
our obligation to fund multi employer pension plans to which we contribute may have an adverse impact on us 
we contribute to at least multi employer pension plans covering at least of our current employees 
we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans 
the pension protection act enacted in requires under funded pension plans to improve their funding ratios 
we do not have current plan financial information for the multi employer plans to which we contribute but  based on the information available to us  we believe that some of them are under funded 
we cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding  if any  we may be required to make to these plans and  therefore  have not recorded any related liabilities 
however  plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 
furthermore  under current law  upon the termination of a multi employer pension plan  or in the event of a mass withdrawal of contributing employers  we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities 
there can be no assurance that there will not be a termination of  or mass withdrawal of employers contributing to  any of the multi employer pension plans to which we contribute or that  in the event of such a termination or mass withdrawal  the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions  and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan which is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities 
our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets 
the recent significant decline in the markets resulted in our recording a value for the plan assets that significantly differed from the plan asset value allied had recorded in its financial statements prior to the merger 
a continuation or further decline in the value of these investments could increase our pension expenses and related funding requirements in the future 
additionally  our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions  which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  interest rates and other factors 
a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
the loss of key personnel could have material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and growth prospects 
our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers 
the loss of the services of key employees and officers  whether such loss is through resignation or other causes  or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and growth prospects

on september   a putative class action was filed in the circuit court in and for broward county  florida  by the teamsters local annuity fund against us and the members of republic s board of directors  individually 
both the delaware consolidated action and the florida action were brought on behalf of a purported class of our stockholders and primarily sought  among other things  to enjoin the proposed transaction between republic and allied  as well as damages and attorneys fees 
the actions also sought to compel us to 
table of contents accept the unsolicited proposals made by waste  or at least compel our board of directors to further consider and evaluate the waste proposals  which proposals were subsequently withdrawn 
on september   the defendants in the florida litigation filed a motion to stay or to dismiss the lawsuit in light of the consolidated delaware class action 
on october   plaintiffs in the consolidated delaware action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to require the defendants to make certain additional disclosures prior to the stockholder vote on the merger 
on october   the defendants entered into a memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs regarding the settlement of the delaware and florida actions 
as part of this memorandum of understanding  we agreed to make certain additional disclosures to our stockholders and such disclosures were made by us in our current report on form k filed with the sec on october  as of january   following completion of certain confirmatory discovery by counsel to plaintiffs  the parties executed a stipulation of settlement 
the stipulation of settlement is subject to customary conditions  including court approval following notice to our stockholders 
the stipulation of settlement provides that a hearing will be scheduled at which the court will consider the fairness  reasonableness and adequacy of the settlement which  if finally approved by the court  will resolve all of the claims that were or could have been brought in the actions being settled  including all claims relating to the merger transaction  the merger agreement  our rejections of the unsolicited waste proposals  and any disclosures made in connection therewith 
the stipulation of settlement also provides that plaintiffs counsel may petition the court for an award of attorneys fees and expenses to be paid by us 
on february   the court preliminarily approved the settlement agreed to in the stipulation and set a final hearing to consider the fairness of the settlement for may  there can be no assurance that the court will approve the settlement agreed to in the stipulation of settlement 
in such event  the settlement may be terminated 
on december   the doj and seven state attorneys general filed a complaint  hold separate stipulation and order  and competitive impact statement  together with a proposed final judgment  in the united states district court for the district of columbia  in connection with approval under the hsr act of our merger with allied 
the court entered the hold separate stipulation and order on december   which terminated the waiting period under the hsr act and allowed the parties to close the transaction subject to the conditions described in the hold separate stipulation and order 
these conditions include the divestiture of certain assets 
however  the final judgment can only be approved by the court after the doj publishes a notice in the federal register and considers comments it receives 
during this period  if the doj believes that the final judgment is no longer in the public interest  the doj may withdraw its support of the final judgment and seek to prevent the final judgment from becoming final in its present form 
likewise  the court may  in its discretion  modify the divestitures or other relief sought by the doj if the court believes that such modification is in the public interest

management believes that the court will enter the final judgment and that modifications to the final judgment  if any  will not be material 
landfill and environmental we have been notified that we are considered a potentially responsible party at a number of sites under cercla or other environmental laws 
in all cases  such alleged responsibility is due to the actions of companies prior to the time we acquired them 
we continually review our status with respect to each site  taking into account the alleged connection to the site and the extent of the contribution to the volume of waste at the site  the available evidence connecting the entity to that site  and the number and financial soundness of other potentially responsible parties at the site 
the ultimate amounts for environmental liabilities at sites where we may be a potentially responsible party cannot be determined and estimates of such liabilities made by us require assumptions about future events subject to a number of uncertainties  including the extent of the contamination  the appropriate remedy  the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties 

table of contents where we have concluded that our share of potential liabilities is probable and can be reasonably estimated  a provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements 
since the ultimate outcome of these matters may differ from the estimates used in our assessments to date  the recorded liabilities are periodically evaluated as additional information becomes available to ascertain that the accrued liabilities are adequate 
we have liabilities recorded for environmental matters as of december  of approximately million 
it is reasonably possible that we could have adjustments to our estimates for these matters in the near term that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

we also paid approximately 
million in sanctions to comply with the f os during the three months ended march  republic ohio has performed certain interim remedial actions required by the oepa  but the oepa has not approved republic ohio s plan to suppress the chemical reaction 
republic ohio received additional orders from the oepa requiring certain actions to be taken by republic ohio  including additional air quality monitoring and the installation and continued maintenance of gas well dewatering systems 
republic ohio has also entered into an agreed order on consent aoc with the epa requiring the reimbursement of costs incurred by the epa and requiring republic ohio to a design and install a temperature and gas monitoring system  b design and install a composite cap or cover  and c develop and implement an air monitoring program 
the aoc became effective on april  and republic ohio has complied with the terms of the aoc 
republic ohio also is in the process of constructing an additional fire break under the authority and supervision of the epa 
we had learned that the commissioner of the stark county health department commission recommended that the stark county board of health board of health suspend countywide s annual operating license 
we had also learned that the commissioner intended to recommend that the board of health deny countywide s license application for republic ohio obtained a preliminary injunction on november  prohibiting the board of health from suspending its operating license 
republic ohio also obtained a preliminary injunction on february  prohibiting the board of health from denying its operating license application 
the litigation with the board of health is pending in the stark county court of common pleas 
we and the board of health have been participating in discussions regarding facility licensing that have resulted in an agreement whereby republic ohio will secure its operating license and pay million to resolve the issues at countywide 
the specific terms of the agreement are being finalized 
we believe that we have performed or are diligently performing all actions required under the f os and the aoc and that countywide does not pose a threat to the environment 
additionally  we believe that we satisfy the rules and regulations that govern the operating license at countywide

we were also assessed million in sanctions related to the consent decree 
rssn is currently working with the clark county staff and board of commissioners to develop a mechanism to fund the costs to comply with the consent decree 
however  we have not recorded any potential recoveries 
it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the remediation liabilities recorded to reflect the effects of new or additional information  to the extent that such information impacts the costs  timing or duration of the required actions 
future changes in our estimates of the costs  timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

carter valley matter on april   federal agents executed a search warrant at bfi waste systems of tennessee  llc s carter valley landfill the landfill and seized information regarding the landfill s receipt of special waste from one of its commercial customers 
on the same date  the us attorney s office for the eastern district of tennessee served a grand jury subpoena on us seeking related documents the subpoena 
shortly thereafter  the government agreed to an indefinite extension of our time to respond to the subpoena  and there were no further communications between us and the federal government until in  while the federal investigation was pending  the tennessee department of environment and conservation investigated the landfill s receipt of the same special waste  determined that there was not a sufficient basis to conclude that the landfill had disposed of hazardous waste  and took no enforcement action 
on april   the us attorney s office issued a new grand jury subpoena seeking the same categories of documents requested in the subpoena 
we are currently producing documents in response to the subpoena 
on january   the doj sent a letter to us stating that it believed  based on its initial investigation  that certain unnamed employees at the landfill had violated the rcra and that we were liable for these criminal violations under the theory of respondeat superior 
if convicted  pursuant to applicable law  we could be subject to a wide range of criminal or civil 
table of contents penalties 
criminal penalties may not be more than the greatest of a maximum of  for each day of violation  a calculation of twice the gross pecuniary gain from the offense or a maximum of  we could also be subject to civil penalties of  per day per violation 
we intend to meet with the doj as soon as practicable to discuss the government s investigation and understand the basis for the government s belief that our employees violated rcra 
tax matters we and our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the us and puerto rico as well as income tax in multiple state jurisdictions 
we acquired allied s open tax periods as part of the acquisition 
allied is currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years  including federal income tax audits for calendar years through we are also engaged in tax litigation as a result of our risk management companies 
these matters are further discussed below 
risk management companies prior to allied s acquisition of bfi on july   bfi operating companies  as part of a risk management initiative to manage and reduce costs associated with certain liabilities  contributed assets and existing environmental and self insurance liabilities to six fully consolidated bfi risk management companies rmcs in exchange for stock representing a minority ownership interest in the rmcs 
subsequently  the bfi operating companies sold that stock in the rmcs to third parties at fair market value which resulted in a capital loss of approximately million for tax purposes  calculated as the excess of the tax basis of the stock over the cash proceeds received 
on january   the irs designated this type of transaction and other similar transactions as a potentially abusive tax shelter under irs regulations 
during  the irs proposed the disallowance of all of this capital loss 
at the time of the disallowance  the primary argument advanced by the irs for disallowing the capital loss was that the tax basis of the stock of the rmcs received by the bfi operating companies was required to be reduced by the amount of liabilities assumed by the rmcs even though such liabilities were contingent and  therefore  not liabilities recognized for tax purposes 
under the irs interpretation  there was no capital loss on the sale of the stock since the tax basis of the stock should have approximated the proceeds received 
allied protested the disallowance to the appeals office of the irs in august in april  the appeals office of the irs upheld the disallowance of the capital loss deduction 
as a result  in late april allied paid a deficiency to the irs of million for bfi tax years prior to the acquisition 
allied also received a notification from the irs assessing a penalty of million and interest of million relating to the asserted million deficiency 
in july  allied filed a suit for refund in the united states court of federal claims cfc 
the government thereafter filed a counterclaim in the case for the million penalty and million of interest claimed by the irs 
in december  the irs agreed to suspend the collection of this penalty and interest until a decision is rendered on allied s suit for refund 
in july  while the cfc case was pending  allied discovered what it construed to be a jurisdictional defect in the case that could have prevented its recovery of the refund amounts claimed even if allied would have been successful on the underlying merits 
accordingly  in september  allied filed a motion to dismiss the case without prejudice on jurisdictional grounds 
in march  the cfc granted allied s motion dismissing the case 
thereafter  in july  the government appealed the decision to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit federal circuit 
in april  the federal circuit reversed the lower court s decision and remanded the case back to the cfc for further proceedings 
in may  allied filed a petition for panel rehearing with the federal circuit  requesting that the court reconsider its ruling 
in june  the federal circuit denied allied s petition 
in december  a hearing was held in the cfc 
at this hearing  we informed the judge of our intention to withdraw our suit from the cfc in order to continue to litigate the merits of our position in the us district 
table of contents court of arizona 
we believe the decisional law applicable to this matter is more favorable to taxpayers in the us district court of arizona than in the cfc 
to expedite the withdrawal from the cfc  in january  we paid the government s counterclaim for penalty and penalty related interest of approximately million 
prior to december   allied had already paid million in tax and related interest relating to the through bfi tax years 
as a result  we have paid all tax  interest  and penalty related to the through bfi tax years  which are the tax years under cfc jurisdiction 
if  in response to our decision to withdraw our suit from the cfc  the court issues an order dismissing the case with prejudice  the tax  interest and penalty amounts paid by us will not be recoverable in any subsequent action 
however  if the court issues an order dismissing the case without prejudice  we will not be entirely prevented from asserting a claim contesting the irs tax adjustment applicable to the through bfi tax years and seeking the recovery of some or all of the tax  interest and penalty amounts previously paid  although some of our claim may be barred by the applicable statute of limitations 
in addition  allied has a second refund suit currently pending in arizona 
in august  allied received from the irs a statutory notice of deficiency notice related to its utilization of bfi s capital loss carryforward on allied s tax return 
because of the high rate of interest associated with this matter  allied previously paid all tax and interest related to this tax year 
consequently  the notice related only to the irs asserted penalty for allied s tax year 
on october   allied filed a suit for refund in the us district court of arizona 
we anticipate that the doj will file a counterclaim for the asserted penalty and consequently the irs will suspend collection of the penalty  as occurred in connection with the cfc action 
however  there can be no assurance that the irs will suspend collection efforts 
if the capital loss deduction is fully disallowed for all applicable years  we estimate that it would have a total cash impact including amounts already paid to the irs as described below of approximately million related to federal taxes  state taxes and interest  and  approximately million related to penalty and penalty related interest 
these amounts have been fully accrued on our consolidated balance sheet  and disallowance would not materially affect our consolidated results of operations  however  a payment beyond the amounts already paid would adversely impact our cash flows in the period such payment was made 
the accrual of additional interest charges through the time these matters are resolved will affect our consolidated results of operations 
due to the high rate of interest associated with this matter  we have previously paid the irs and various state tax authorities million related to capital loss deductions taken on bfi s through and allied s through tax returns 
in addition  we have paid approximately million of penalty and penalty related interest for our refund suit in the cfc 
although we have fully accrued all tax  interest  penalty and penalty related interest relating to this matter  we intend to vigorously pursue our claim for refund of the tax and interest and our defense to the irs claims for penalties and penalty related interest 
while there can be no assurances  we anticipate that the final resolution of the dispute  through adjudication or settlement  may be more favorable than the full amount currently accrued for tax  interest  penalty and penalty related interest 
exchange of partnership interests in april  allied exchanged minority partnership interests in four waste to energy facilities for majority partnership interests in equipment purchasing businesses  which are now wholly owned subsidiaries 
in november  the irs issued a formal disallowance to allied contending that the exchange was instead a sale on which a corresponding gain should have been recognized 
although we intend to vigorously defend our position on this matter  if the exchange is treated as a sale  we estimate it could have a potential federal and state cash tax impact of approximately million plus accrued interest through december  of approximately million

risk factors 
overview of our business as of december   we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic non hazardous solid waste industry 
we provide non hazardous solid waste collection services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers through collection companies in states and puerto rico 
we also own or operate transfer stations  active solid waste landfills and recycling facilities 
in early  we began to experience the impact of the economic slowdown on our operations 
this slowdown intensified during which  combined with a tightening of the credit markets  resulted in unprecedented changes in the us and global economies 
against this backdrop  consumption in the us slowed dramatically 
new housing construction  a primary driver of our temporary industrial collection business  declined in excess of compared to more recently we are seeing a slowdown in commercial construction 
a slowdown in manufacturing has resulted in a decrease in our permanent industrial collection business 
furthermore  volumes in our commercial collection business began to decline in the second half of as consumers decreased discretionary spending 
we are also beginning to see lower commercial volumes due to store closures and increased commercial vacancies 
fuel prices  which reached historic highs in the summer  dropped quickly in the fall of this decrease in fuel prices was offset by corresponding declines in fuel surcharges and  therefore  did not significantly improve our profitability 
in addition  prices for recycling commodities declined in response to a decline in global demand 
although we hedged a portion of our commodity sales  declines in commodity prices have had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our profitability 
despite the challenging economic environment  our business performed well during due in large part to the indispensible nature of our services and the scalability of our business 
our internal revenue growth during was 
increases in core price and fuel recovery fees offset volume declines 
this increase in price and fuel recovery fees  together with cost control steps taken by our operations management to scale the business down for lower volumes  also served to moderate profit margin declines associated with rising costs and declining revenue due to decreases in service volumes 
during december  we completed our merger with allied  forming the second largest waste management company in the us we believe that this merger creates a strong operating platform that will allow us to continue to provide quality service to our customers and superior returns to our stockholders 
we expect that the economic challenges we experienced during the latter part of will continue throughout we anticipate a decrease in volumes in all lines of our business 
we also anticipate that prices for recycling commodities will remain depressed 
however  we believe that we will benefit from our cost control and pricing initiatives 
ours is a capital intensive business 
slower growth allows us to reduce capital spending  thus maintaining strong free cash flow despite a weaker economy 
in addition  we intend to focus our attention on integrating our newly merged company and achieving cost synergies as a result of the merger 
business acquisitions and divestitures we make decisions to acquire  invest in or divest of businesses based on financial and strategic considerations 
businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 

table of contents merger with allied waste industries  inc on june   republic entered into an agreement and plan of merger with allied 
prior to the merger  allied was the second largest provider of non hazardous solid waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services in the united states  as measured by revenue 
the completion of the merger was subject to certain terms and conditions  including  but not limited to  approval of the transaction by the stockholders of both republic and allied  regulatory approval from the doj  and receipt of credit ratings for the combined company classifying our senior unsecured debt as investment grade 
having met those terms and conditions on december   we completed the merger 
as of the effective date of the merger  each share of allied common stock outstanding was converted into 
shares of our common stock 
we issued approximately million shares of common stock to allied stockholders in the merger 
allied stockholders received approximately of the outstanding common stock of the combined company in respect of their allied shares on a diluted basis as a result of the merger  and republic stockholders retained approximately of the outstanding common stock of the combined company on a diluted basis 
the total purchase price paid for allied  including the value of common stock issued based on the average closing prices of republic s common stock for the five day period around june  the announcement date totaled approximately billion 
republic has been determined to be the acquiring company for accounting purposes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
therefore  we have accounted for the merger as an acquisition of allied by republic  using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with gaap 
our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of allied from the date of the acquisition  and have not been retroactively restated to include allied s historical financial position or results of operations 
in accordance with the purchase method of accounting  the purchase price paid has been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date  with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being recorded as goodwill 
republic is in the process of valuing all of the assets and liabilities acquired in the acquisition  and  until we have completed our valuation process  there may be adjustments to our estimates of fair values and the resulting preliminary purchase price allocation 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired goodwill associated with the acquisition of allied totaled billion 
in addition  when we acquire landfills as part of a group of assets  we allocate part of the purchase price to airspace based on the estimated fair value of the landfills relative to the fair value of other assets within the acquired group 
we allocated billion of the total purchase price paid for the acquisition of allied to landfill airspace 
landfill purchase price is amortized using the units of consumption method over total available airspace  which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate 
as a condition of the merger with allied  we reached a settlement with the doj requiring us to divest of assets serving fifteen metropolitan areas  including los angeles and san francisco  ca  denver  co  atlanta  ga  northwestern indiana  lexington  ky  flint  mi  cape girardeau  mo  charlotte  nc  cleveland  oh  philadelphia  pa  greenville spartanburg  sc  and fort worth  houston and lubbock  tx 
the settlement requires us to divest of commercial waste collection routes  nine municipal solid waste landfills and ten transfer stations  together with ancillary assets and  in three cases  access to landfill disposal capacity 
in february  we entered into an agreement to divest certain assets to waste connections  inc the assets that are being divested under this agreement include six municipal solid waste landfills  six collection operations and three transfer stations across the following seven markets los angeles  ca  denver  co  houston  tx  lubbock  tx  greenville spartanburg  sc  charlotte  nc  and flint  mi 
the transaction with waste connections is subject to closing conditions regarding due diligence  regulatory approval and other customary matters 
closing is expected to occur in the second quarter of combined revenue of the assets being sold is approximately million 
during december  we incurred million of restructuring charges associated with integrating our operations with allied 
these charges primarily consist of severance and other employee termination and relocation benefits and consulting fees paid to outside parties 

table of contents other business acquisitions and divestitures in addition to the acquisition of allied in december  we acquired various other solid waste businesses during the years ended december   and the aggregate purchase price we paid for these transactions was million  million and million  respectively 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired goodwill associated with these acquisitions during  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
in november  we divested of our texas based compost  mulch and soil business and received proceeds of million 
a gain of million was recorded in on this divestiture 
revenue we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations 
our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal and recycling 
the following table reflects our revenue by service line for the respective years ended december in millions collection residential commercial industrial other total collection transfer and disposal less intercompany transfer and disposal  net other revenue our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities 
we generally provide industrial and commercial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years 
our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties 
in general  we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials 
no one customer has individually accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 
the cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal  labor  self insurance  fuel and equipment maintenance costs 
it also includes capital costs for equipment and facilities 
we seek operating efficiencies by controlling the movement of waste from the point of collection through disposal 
during december  subsequent to our acquisition of allied  approximately of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills that we own or operate 
our landfill costs include daily operating expenses  costs of capital for cell development  costs for final capping  closure and post closure  and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance 
daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal  methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance  interim cap maintenance  and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials 
we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred 
we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to cell development 
in life cycle accounting  certain direct costs are capitalized  and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
these costs include all 
table of contents costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation  natural and synthetic liners  construction of leachate collection systems  installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are capitalized  and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 
these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs 
changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs  available airspace  inflation and applicable regulations 
changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates  changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted

in addition  of our revenue growth is due to our acquisition of allied in december revenue growth also benefited from higher fuel surcharges and environmental fees 
however  during we experienced lower prices for commodities

cost of operations 
cost of operations was billion  billion and billion  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cost of operations in aggregate dollars for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is primarily a result of our acquisition of allied in december the remaining increase in cost of operations in aggregate dollars and the increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to charges we recorded during of million related to estimated costs to comply with f os issued by the oepa and the aoc issued by the epa in response to environmental conditions at our countywide facility in ohio  million related to environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility 
table of contents in contra costa county  california and million related to environmental conditions at the sunrise landfill 
the increase in cost of operations and as a percentage of our revenue for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is primarily a result of the million charge we recorded in cost of operations related to environmental conditions at our countywide facility and an million charge related to our closed disposal facility in contra costa county  california 
the following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended december   and in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue subcontractor  disposal and third party fees labor and benefits maintenance and operating expenses insurance and other cost of operations a description of our cost categories is as follows subcontractor  disposal and third party fees include costs such as third party disposal  transportation of waste  host fees and cost of goods sold 
the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for all periods presented is primarily due to higher revenue resulting from improved pricing 
in addition  the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is also due to lower costs of goods sold associated with the sale of our lower margin  texas based compost  mulch and soil business in november during  drier weather  particularly in our southern region  resulted in lower disposal costs 
the reduction in costs were partially offset by additional third party hauling costs incurred during associated with our assuming responsibility for hauling waste from the city of toronto to one of our landfills in michigan 
labor and benefits include costs such as wages  salaries  payroll taxes and health benefits for our frontline service employees and their supervisors 
such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  versus the comparable period decreased due to higher revenue resulting from improved pricing and lower labor costs associated with volume decreases in various lines of business 
the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is due to increases in benefits including health insurance 
in addition  during december  we assumed responsibility for hauling a portion of our transfer station volumes to one of our landfills 
this hauling service reduced our third party fees and increased various other cost categories  the most significant of which was labor 
maintenance and operating includes costs such as fuel  parts  shop labor and benefits  third party repairs  and landfill monitoring and operating 
the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is primarily a result of the million charge related to the countywide facility  the million charge related to our closed disposal facility in california and the million charge related to the sunrise landfill 
this increase is partially offset by the million of charges related to our countywide facility and the million charge related to our closed disposal facility in california recorded during the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is primarily due to an increase in landfill operating costs resulting from the charges recorded during the year ended december  of million related to our countywide facility and million charge related to our closed disposal facility in california 
excluding these charges in the respective periods  the decrease in expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december  and are primarily due to increases in fuel prices 
our average cost of fuel per gallon increased approximately from per gallon during to per gallon during  and increased approximately from per gallon during to per gallon for current average fuel prices are per gallon 

table of contents insurance and other includes costs such as workers compensation  auto and general liability insurance  property taxes  property maintenance and utilities 
the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for all of the years presented is primarily due to an increase in the severity of our automobile insurance claims 
the cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies 
as such  care should be taken when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies

depreciation  amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year ended december  versus the comparable is primarily due to our acquisition of allied in december the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is primarily due to a reduction of amortization expense associated with lower landfill volumes 
the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is partially due to million of adjustments to landfill amortization expense for changes in estimates and assumptions related to our reviews of landfill asset retirement obligations under sfas in addition  during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of additional depletion and amortization expense associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our countywide facility 
depreciation expense during was also slightly higher due to our ongoing truck and equipment replacement program 
amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets that have a finite life and are amortized generally consist of customer relationships  long term contracts and covenants not to compete 
expenses for amortization of intangible assets were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   
and 
for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  versus the comparable and periods is due to the amortization of intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisition of allied 
we expect this acquisition will increase our intangible asset amortization expense by approximately million in accretion expense 
accretion expense was million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   
and 
for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars in versus the comparable and periods is primarily due to an increase in asset retirement obligations associated with our acquisition of allied 
the asset retirement obligations acquired from allied are recorded using a discount rate of  which is higher than the credit adjusted  risk free rate we have used historically to record such obligations 
our accretion expense in will reflect the increase in asset retirement obligations recorded in the acquisition of allied and the impact of using a higher overall average discount rate for recording these liabilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in such expenses both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is primarily due to million of bad debt expense related to conforming allied s methodology for recording the allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable with ours and million to provide for specific bankruptcy exposures 
this increase is also due to million of settlement charges related to our estimates of the outcome of various legal matters 
excluding these costs  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  would have been million  or as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in selling  
table of contents general and administrative expenses excluding the costs mentioned above in aggregate dollars during versus the comparable period is primarily due to our merger with allied 
the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for versus the comparable period is primarily due to our merger with allied and a million reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts which we recorded during the year ended december  as a result of refining our estimate for our allowance based on our historical collection experience 
the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year ended december  versus the comparable period is primarily due to the expansion of our business 
the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for versus is primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation costs and the million reduction to our allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during upon the completion of the integration of allied  our goal is to maintain our selling  general and administrative costs at no more than of revenue  which we believe is appropriate given our existing business platform 
asset impairments 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million charge related to the impairment of our countywide facility 
this impairment relates to the anticipated loss of permitted airspace associated with complying with f os issued by the oepa and the aoc issued by the epa based upon recent negotiations with the oepa and the epa 
during the year ended december   we recorded a loss of million for expected losses on asset divestitures mandated by the doj 
also during the year ended december   we recorded million of other impairment charges  consisting primarily of charges related to our former corporate headquarters in south florida 
restructuring charges 
during the year ended december   we incurred million of restructuring charges associated with integrating our operations with allied 
these charges primarily consist of severance and other employee termination and relocation benefits and consulting fees paid to outside parties 
operating income 
operating income was million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the reduction in operating income as a percentage of revenue for versus the comparable and periods is primarily due to the remediation  asset impairment and restructuring charges noted above 
interest expense 
we incurred interest expense primarily on our credit facilities  senior notes and tax exempt bonds 
interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense during the year ended december  versus the comparable period is primarily due to the additional debt we acquired as a result of our acquisition of allied 
in addition  during december  we incurred approximately million of non cash interest expense 
this expense relates primarily to a million discount we recorded to fair value the debt we acquired from allied that is being amortized generally over the term of the related debt 
it also relates to accretion expenses associated with discounted environmental and risk insurance reserves 
capitalized interest was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income and other income expense  net 
interest income and other income  net of other expense  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the amount in is primarily due to a million gain related to the sale of our compost  mulch and soil business in texas 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we incurred several expenses that were not tax deductible as a result of the 
table of contents merger with allied 
in addition  lower pre tax earnings contributed to the increase in the effective tax rate 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net tax benefit of million in our provision for income taxes related to the resolution of various income tax matters  including the effective completion of internal revenue service audits of our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years through income tax expense for the year ended december  includes a million benefit related to the resolution of various income tax matters  including the effective completion of internal revenue service audits for the years through landfill and environmental matters available airspace the following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for active landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended december   and balance permits changes balance as of acquisition granted  in changes as of december  of net of airspace engineering in december  allied closures consumed estimates design permitted airspace cubic yards in millions number of sites probable expansion airspace cubic yards in millions number of sites total available airspace cubic yards in millions number of sites balance landfill permits changes balance as of new operating granted  in changes as of december  expansions contracts  net of airspace engineering in december  undertaken net closures consumed estimates design permitted airspace cubic yards in millions number of sites probable expansion airspace cubic yards in millions number of sites total available airspace cubic yards in millions number of sites balance permits changes as of granted  in balance december  net of airspace engineering as of december  closures consumed estimates permitted airspace cubic yards in millions number of sites probable expansion airspace cubic yards in millions number of sites total available airspace cubic yards in millions number of sites changes in engineering estimates typically include minor modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information 
changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill s footprint or vertical slopes 

table of contents as of december   we owned or operated active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be billion in place cubic yards 
total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace 
these estimates are developed at least annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys 
as of december   total available disposal capacity is estimated to be billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 
billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace 
before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and  therefore  included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity  it must meet all of our expansion criteria 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further information 
during  total available airspace increased by a net billion cubic yards due the merger with allied in december  which contributed active landfills representing billion cubic yards of permitted and probable expansion airspace to our landfill assets 
excluding the merger with allied  total available airspace decreased by a net 
billion cubic yards primarily due to airspace consumed  changes in engineering estimates and changes in design 
the decrease during due to changes in engineering estimates is primarily due to a reduction of remaining airspace at our countywide facility 
during  total available airspace increased by a net million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken  changes in engineering estimates and permits granted  partially offset by airspace consumed and changes in design 
in addition  during the year ended december   total available airspace increased as a result of obtaining a new contract to operate a landfill in texas  which was substantially offset by a reduction resulting from not renewing a contract to operate a small landfill in texas 
changes in design in are primarily due to a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our countywide facility 
during  total available airspace decreased by million cubic yards due to airspace consumption  partially offset by permits granted and changes in engineering estimates 
at december   of our total available airspace  or million cubic yards  consisted of probable expansion airspace at nine of our landfills 
at december   of our total available airspace  or million cubic yards  consisted of probable expansion airspace at of our landfills 
between december  and december   we received permits for eight of our probable expansions  which demonstrates our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace 
as of december   of our landfills meet all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity  of which were added as a result of our acquisition of allied 
at projected annual volumes  these landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of years  including probable expansion airspace 
the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is years 
we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for probable expansion airspace 
the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december  number of sites number of sites percent without expansion with expansion total of airspace airspace sites total to years to years to years to years years total sites with expansion airspace include two landfills with less than five years of remaining permitted airspace 

table of contents final capping  closure and post closure costs as of december   accrued final capping  closure and post closure costs were billion  of which million is current and million is long term as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs 
remediation and other charges for landfill matters in december  we recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation of million for the environmental liabilities we acquired as part of the acquisition of allied 
these liabilities represent our preliminary estimate of our costs to remediate sites that were previously owned or operated by allied  or sites at which allied  or a predecessor company that they had acquired  had been identified as a potentially responsible party 
the remediation of these sites is in various stages of completion from having received an initial notice from a regulatory agency and commencing investigation to being in the final stages of postremedial monitoring 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies environmental remediation liabilities  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further information 
during  we recorded pre tax charges of million related to estimated costs to comply with f os issued by the oepa in response to environmental conditions at countywide and to undertake certain other remedial actions that we agreed with the oepa to perform  including  without limitation  installing a fire break and removing liquids from gas extraction wells 
we also recorded million of additional depletion and amortization expense during the year ended december  associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at this landfill as a result of the oepa s f os 
during  republic ohio  an ohio limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of ours and parent of countywide  entered into an aoc with the epa requiring the reimbursement of costs incurred by the epa and requiring republic ohio to a design and install a temperature and gas monitoring system  b design and install a composite cap or cover  and c develop and implement an air monitoring program 
the aoc became effective on april  and republic ohio is complying with the terms of the aoc 
we received additional orders from the oepa in based upon current information and engineering analyses and discussions with the oepa and epa subsequent to the signing of the above mentioned agreement  we recorded an additional pre tax charge for remediation costs of million during these costs include placing an enhanced cap in excess of countywide s current permit requirements over certain portions of the landfill 
we have requested relief with respect to certain requirements of the orders received from the oepa as we believe the requirements should no longer be considered essential in light of the work we have now agreed with the epa to perform 
while we are vigorously pursuing financial contributions from third parties for our costs to comply with the f os and the additional remedial actions  we have not recorded any receivables for potential recoveries 
in addition  during we recorded an impairment charge of million related to a reduction in our estimated remaining airspace at countywide 
during  we recorded a pre tax charge of million associated with an increase in estimated leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in contra costa county  california 
these additional costs are attributable to a consent agreement with the california department of toxic substance control 
during  we recorded an additional pre tax charge of million for increases in our estimated leachate disposal costs and leachate treatment equipment costs at this facility 
on august   republic services of southern nevada rssn  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  signed a consent decree and settlement agreement consent decree with the epa  the bureau of land management and clark county  nevada related to the sunrise landfill 
under the consent decree  rssn has agreed to perform certain remedial actions at the sunrise landfill for which rssn and clark county 
table of contents were otherwise jointly and severally liable 
as a result  we recorded  based on management s best estimates  a pre tax charge of million during  of which million was recorded for remediation costs associated with complying with the consent decree 
rssn is currently working with the clark county staff and board of commissioners to develop a mechanism to fund the costs to comply with the consent decree 
however  we have not recorded any potential recoveries 
the majority of this remediation liability is expected to be paid during and it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the charges noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional information  to the extent that such information impacts the costs  timing or duration of the required actions 
future changes in our estimates of the costs  timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
no other significant amounts were charged to income for remediation costs during the years ended december   and we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with acquisitions of properties through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace  as appropriate

the increase in depletion  amortization and accretion expense from to is primarily due to million of accretion expense associated with capping  closure and post closure liabilities acquired from allied 
the asset retirement obligations acquired from allied are recorded using a discount rate of  which is higher than the rate we have historically used 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  regarding sfas adjustments 
the increase in depletion  amortization and accretion expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed from to is partially due to an increase of million in landfill amortization expense that we recorded during the year ended december  related to reviews of landfill asset retirement obligations at our landfills 
this increase is also partially due to million of additional depletion and amortization expense we recorded during the year ended december  associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our countywide facility 
during the years ended december   and  our weighted average compaction rate was approximately  pounds per cubic yard based on our three year historical moving average 
our compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and decomposition of waste 
as of december   we expect to spend an estimated additional billion on existing landfills  primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures  over their expected remaining lives 
our total expected investment  excluding non depletable land  estimated to be billion  or per cubic yard  is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the units of consumption method

at december   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our revolving credit facilities 
we were also in compliance with the non financial covenants of the indentures relating to our senior notes as of december  on december   we received the requisite consents for a previously announced consent solicitation to amend the supplemental indentures governing certain outstanding debt securities of allied waste north america  inc awna 
the amendment to each supplemental indenture modified the ongoing reporting obligations required of allied 
under the amended supplemental indentures  the ongoing reporting obligations may be satisfied by republic 
the collateral that had secured the awna senior notes and the bfi debentures equally and ratably with the allied bank credit facility was released upon the completion of the merger with allied and the repayment of that facility 
failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our revolving credit facilities  as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events  would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under the revolving credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements 
this could also have an adverse impact on availability of financial assurances 
in addition  maturity acceleration on the revolving credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments  including our senior notes and  therefore  our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity 
if such acceleration of maturities were to occur  we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness 
we would likely have to seek an amendment under our revolving credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity  or asset sales  if necessary 
we may be unable to amend the revolving credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 
financial assurance 
we are required to provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping  closure and post closure costs  and related to our performance under certain collection  landfill and transfer station contracts 
we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits 
the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations 
the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill 
generally  states will require a third party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping  closure and post closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill 
the amount of financial assurance required can  and generally will  differ from the obligation determined and recorded under gaap 
the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract 
additionally  we are required to provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations 
we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during  although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 
these financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not debt of our company 
since we currently have no liability for these financial assurance instruments  they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  we record capping  closure and post closure liabilities and self insurance liabilities as they are incurred 
the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments  in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  would be 
table of contents recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations 
we do not expect this to occur 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations  other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that are not classified as debt 
we do not guarantee any third party debt 
free cash flow we define free cash flow  which is not a measure determined in accordance with gaap  as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our free cash flow for the years ended december   and is calculated as follows in millions cash provided by operating activities purchases of property and equipment proceeds from sales of property and equipment free cash flow free cash flow for the year ended december  was negatively impacted by million of payments made to the irs for interest and taxes related to the risk management companies matter discussed in item legal proceedings 
this payment was accrued by allied and included in our purchase accounting allocation for the acquisition  and paid in december to stop further accrual of interest and taxes on this matter 
free cash flow for the year ended december  was positively impacted due to approximately million of federal tax payments being deferred until february as a result of our merger with allied 
free cash flow for the year ended december  was higher than anticipated due to lower than expected purchases of property and equipment  higher deferred income taxes and lower payments for asset retirement obligations 
free cash flow for the year ended december  was negatively affected by an million federal tax payment for that had been deferred until february as a result of an irs notice issued in response to hurricane katrina 
purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures 
a reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period for the years ended december   and is as follows in millions purchases of property and equipment presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows adjustment for property and equipment received during the prior period but paid for in the following period  net property and equipment received during the current period the adjustments noted above do not affect either our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows or our free cash flow 

table of contents we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment  net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment 
it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service  investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided  maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt  paying cash dividends  and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization 
in addition  free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation 
the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations 
free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments 
our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
contingencies for a description of our commitments and contingencies  see note  income taxes  and note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
critical accounting judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management 
the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
such critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 
we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas 
residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 
accounting for the acquisition of allied acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with gaap 
the purchase method of accounting requires that the purchase price paid for an acquisition be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the effective date of the acquisition  with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being recorded as goodwill 
the consolidated financial statements of the acquirer include the operating results of the acquired business from the date of the acquisition  and are not retroactively restated to include the historical position or the results of operations of the acquired business 
these estimates are revised during the allocation period when the information necessary to finalize the fair value estimates is received and analyzed  or if information regarding contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify the assets and liabilities acquired 
republic is in the process of valuing all of the assets and liabilities acquired in our acquisition of allied 
until we have completed our valuation process  there may be adjustments to our estimates of fair values and the resulting preliminary purchase price allocation reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  the significant areas of accounting where estimates of fair values are reflected in our consolidated financial statements include landfills and other property and equipment  other intangible assets  landfill asset retirement obligations  legal and environmental reserves  self insurance reserves  income taxes  other non current assets and long term obligations  and assets held for sale 
our consolidated financial statements also include our estimates of restructuring costs incurred through december   a portion of which will be paid in future periods 
changes in our estimates of fair values may impact our results of operations in future periods 

table of contents residual risks the residual risks identified below related to critical accounting judgments and estimates are relevant to the fair value estimation processes for acquisitions

risk factors 
landfill accounting landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further herein 
our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories  each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset 
landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping  closure and post closure liabilities which result in a corresponding landfill retirement asset 
landfill development costs we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site 
in life cycle accounting  all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized  and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are also capitalized  and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 
site permits 
in order to develop  construct and operate a landfill  we are required to obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local  state and federal levels 
the permitting process requires an initial siting study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations 
the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but prior to the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 
residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes to the landfill site permitting process 
these changes could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain the landfill permit 
studies performed could be inaccurate  which could result in the denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions 
conditions could exist that were not identified in the study  which may make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the denial of a permit 
denial or revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the landfill asset 
actions by neighboring parties  private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain  maintain or expand permits could result in denial  revocation or suspension of a permit  which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill 
as a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit  improved technical information as a project progresses  or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project  we may decide to reduce the scope of or abandon a project which could result in an asset impairment 
technical landfill design 
upon receipt of initial regulatory approval  technical landfill designs are prepared 
the technical designs  which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill  including the types and quantities of materials that will be required  are reviewed by our environmental management group 
the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
upon approval of the technical designs  the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 

table of contents residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical design 
these changes could make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards 
technical design requirements  as approved  may need modifications at some future point in time 
technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs  difficulty in obtaining a permit or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not appropriate 
permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity 
included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill 
these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed  the depth of excavation  the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side slope construction 
the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards 
this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site specific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 
residual risks estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements 
the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions  including waste compaction practices  site design  climate and the nature of the waste 
capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons 
the number of tons per cubic yard varies by type of waste 
development costs 
the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation  natural and synthetic liners  construction of leachate collection systems  installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site 
we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with third party bids or contractual arrangements  reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness  and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs 
these development costs  together with any costs incurred to acquire  design and permit the landfill  including capitalized interest  are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 
residual risk actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the impact from general economic conditions on the availability of the required materials and labor 
technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions  regulatory changes or legislative changes 
landfill development asset amortization 
in order to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations  we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill 
the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill s operating life 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill s estimated remaining disposal capacity 
the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted  but rather expressed in nominal dollars 
this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 
amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill  including acquisition costs  which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values 
we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value 
amortization rates are also influenced by site specific engineering and cost factors 

table of contents residual risk changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively 
an unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in an asset impairment 
on at least an annual basis  we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill 
these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually 
changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 
landfill asset retirement obligations we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills capping and closure and post closure 
we account for our final capping  closure and post closure activities in accordance with sfas under sfas  obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event 
obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill 
landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill  depending on the nature of the obligation 
all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value 
fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our credit adjusted  risk free rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred 
future costs for final capping  closure and post closure are developed at least annually by engineers  and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 
landfill capping 
as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity  we are required to cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit 
these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill siting process described above 
closure and post closure 
closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill site stops receiving waste  but prior to being certified as closed 
after the entire landfill site has reached capacity and is certified closed  we are required to maintain and monitor the site for a post closure period  which generally extends for years 
costs associated with closure and post closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site and the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems  and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste 
costs associated with post closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling  analysis and statistical reports  third party labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance  transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 
landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets 
estimates of the total future costs required to cap  close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are updated annually 
the estimates include inflation  the specific timing of future cash outflows  and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events 
our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation  which is updated annually in both and 
the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and post closure costs for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a per ton basis 
these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 
capping  closure and post closure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred in and in 

table of contents retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the same credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities 
this accretion expense is charged to operating expenses 
actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 
corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a per ton basis as disposal capacity is consumed 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity 
a per ton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event 
closure and post closure per ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 
residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in capping  closure activities or post closure monitoring activities  types and quantities of materials used  or term of post closure care could cause changes in our cost estimates 
changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow  cost change in airspace compaction estimates or the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively 
this could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense 
actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing  causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities 
changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount the liabilities  which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities  assets and expense 
amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design  post closure monitoring requirements  or the inflation or discount rate 
on an annual basis  we update our estimates of future capping  closure and post closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill 
revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets 
changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively  except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills  where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 
in connection with the annual review of our calculations with respect to landfill asset retirement obligations  we made a change in estimate  which is considered to be a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle as defined by sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
this change  which we believe is preferable  was made to better align the estimated amount of waste placed in an area to be capped which is used to calculate our capping rates with the physical operation of our landfills 
the expected costs related to our capping events did not change and we will continue to use separate rates for each capping event 
this change resulted in a million decrease in our capping asset retirement obligations and related assets 
these assets will be amortized to expense prospectively as a change in estimate  in accordance with sfas this change in estimate will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents permitted and probable disposal capacity 
as described previously  disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit 
we classify this disposal capacity as permitted 
we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates  thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion 
probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies  but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is probable 
we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace 
we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted 
however  because some of these criteria are judgmental  they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted 
in either of these scenarios  our amortization  depletion and accretion expense could change significantly 
our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion are as follows we own or control the land associated with the expansion airspace pursuant to an option agreement  we are committed to supporting the expansion project financially and with appropriate resources  there are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated with the project  including political impediments  progress is being made on the project  the expansion is attainable within a reasonable time frame  and we believe it is likely the expansion permit will be received 
after successfully meeting these criteria  the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates 
additionally  for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure rates  we include the incremental costs to develop  construct  close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 
residual risk we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local  state or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity  or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated  both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be reduced  which generally increases the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure accruals 
an unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also cause an asset impairment 
environmental liabilities we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
under current laws and regulations  we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate  including sites that we have acquired  or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste 
our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater  surface water and soil contamination  as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs 
to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites  we evaluate several factors  including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site  the required remediation methods  the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties 
we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary 
changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are 
table of contents recorded to operating income in the period in which the change in estimate is made 
adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts 
the majority of our environmental remediation liabilities were acquired as part of our acquisition of allied 
we have accounted for the environmental remediation liabilities we acquired from allied based on estimates of their fair values  and we have discounted these liabilities in accordance with sfas prior to our acquisition of allied  allied s environmental remediation liabilities were accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  and american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities sop  which require that estimated losses be recorded for loss contingencies if  prior to the issuance of the financial statements  it is probable that liabilities have been incurred and the amounts of the losses can be reasonably estimated 
if it is probable that a liability has been incurred  but no estimate of the liability is more likely than any other  a liability is recorded at the lower end of the range 
however  amounts recorded under this guidance are generally not considered fair value 
our process for determining the fair value for the environmental liabilities we acquired includes first identifying the population of sites that we either are or have indications that we may be responsible for the costs of remediation 
these sites are then assessed to determine the risks that they are  or may be subject to  that would significantly affect either the cost or timing of remediation activities 
we use these risk scenarios to develop estimates of future cash flows based on the risks identified 
generally speaking  sites with a higher risk of significant variability in future cash flows or timing of those cash flows have more risk scenarios identified than sites which we deem to be at a lower risk 
we then probability weight these risk scenarios and discount these liabilities to present value to determine their fair values 
although we have prepared and recorded a preliminary valuation of the environmental liabilities we acquired from allied  we do not expect to complete our valuation of these liabilities until after we have finalized this valuation  future changes in these estimates will be recorded in accordance with sfas and sop significant adjustments to these reserves may occur in the future 
our other environmental liabilities are accounted for in accordance with sfas and sop the recorded liabilities represent our estimate of the most likely outcome of the matters for which we have determined liability is probable 
these estimates do not take into account discounts to present value the total estimated costs 
we reevaluate these matters as additional information becomes available to ascertain whether the liabilities we have accrued are adequate 
we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 
residual risks we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our environmental remediation liabilities 
our estimates of these liabilities require assumptions about future events that are uncertain 
consequently  our estimates could change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of contamination  the required remediation methods  the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties identified  the financial viability of those parties  and the actions of governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the matter 
actual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution 
an unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to our consolidated statement of income 
self insurance reserves and related costs our insurance programs for workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured 
accruals for self insurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we maintain high deductibles for commercial 
table of contents general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation coverages  ranging from million to million 
residual risks incident rates  including frequency and severity  and other actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to change  which would be adjusted to our consolidated statement of income in the period in which such adjustment is known 
it is possible that recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
adjustments  if any  to estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments will be reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such adjustments are known 
the settlement costs to discharge our obligations  including legal and health care costs  could increase or decrease causing current estimates of our self insurance reserves to change 
loss contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings  claims and regulatory matters  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
consistent with sfas  we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable  and whether it can be reasonably estimated 
we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities 
management s assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
we accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
if a contingent liability is only reasonably possible  we will disclose the potential range of the loss  if estimable 
we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 
residual risks actual costs can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including differing interpretations of laws  opinions on culpability and assessments of the amount of damages 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and generally involve business matters that are by their nature unpredictable 
if a loss contingency results in an adverse judgment or is settled for significant amounts  it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  result of operations or cash flows in the period in which such judgment or settlement occurs 
asset impairment valuation methodology 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 
residual risk if events or changes in circumstances occur  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest assets  certain assets could be impaired which would result in a non cash charge to earnings 
evaluation criteria 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset  a change in its physical condition  or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not 
table of contents that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
residual risk our most significant asset impairment exposure  other than goodwill which is discussed below relates to our landfills 
a significant reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a result of unanticipated events such as regulatory developments  revocation of an existing permit or denial of an expansion permit  or changes in our assumptions used to calculate disposal capacity could trigger an impairment charge 
recognition criteria 
if such circumstances arise  we recognize an impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 
goodwill recoverability valuation methodology 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units  which we define as our geographic operating segments 
we estimate fair value based on projected net cash flows discounted using our weighted average cost of capital  which was approximately in residual risk the estimated fair value of our operating segments could change with changes in our capital structure  cost of debt  interest rates  actual capital expenditure levels  ability to perform at levels that were forecasted or our market capitalization  or other general economic conditions 
for example  a reduction in long term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair value of the operating segments to below their carrying values  which would trigger an impairment charge 
similarly  an increase in our weighted average cost of capital could trigger an impairment charge 
evaluation criteria 
we test goodwill for recoverability on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
for example  a significant adverse change in our liquidity or the business environment  unanticipated competition  a significant adverse action by a regulator  or the disposal of a significant portion of an operating segment could prompt an impairment test between annual assessments 
recognition criteria 
we use a two step test to evaluate goodwill impairment 
under the first step  we compare the fair value of each operating segment to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the operating segment is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the operating segment and we perform step two of the impairment test 
for purposes of performing the second step  we allocate the fair value of each operating segment to all the assets and liabilities of the operating segment as if the operating segment had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test 
we deduct the fair value of tangible net assets and other intangible assets from the fair value of each operating segment to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill for each operating segment 
if the implied fair value of an operating segment s goodwill is lower than its carrying amount  goodwill is impaired and we write it down to its implied fair value 
at the time of a divestiture of an individual business unit within an operating segment  goodwill of the operating segment is allocated to that business unit based on the relative fair value of the unit being disposed to the total fair value of the operating segment and a gain or loss on disposal is determined 
subsequently  the remaining goodwill in the operating segment from which the assets were divested is re evaluated for impairment  which could result in an impairment charge 

table of contents residual risk at the time of divestiture of an individual business unit  we allocate goodwill to the business unit divested and a gain or loss on disposal is calculated 
we may incur non cash losses on future sales of business units primarily due to the goodwill allocated to the business units divested 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than non deductible goodwill and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making this determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas fin provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  and accounting in interim periods 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income 
accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other long term tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
residual risks income tax assets and liabilities established in purchase accounting for acquisitions are based on assumptions that could differ from the ultimate outcome of the tax matters 
such adjustments would be charged or credited to earnings pursuant to sfas r  business combinations  unless they meet certain remeasurement criteria and are allowed to be adjusted to goodwill 
changes in the estimated realizability of deferred tax assets could result in adjustments to our provision for income taxes 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes are based on our judgment 
if our judgments and estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards are incorrect  our provision for income taxes would change 
we are currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years 
the internal revenue code irc and income tax regulations are a complex set of rules that we are required to interpret and apply to our transactions 
positions taken in tax years under examination or subsequent years are subject to challenge 
accordingly  we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken by us or by companies we have acquired are disallowed by the taxing authorities 

table of contents we recognize tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin  and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimates of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to our provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined 
defined benefit pension plans we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan  the bfi retirement plan the plan  as a result of our acquisition of allied in december the plan covers certain employees in the united states  including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements 
the plan s benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document 
the benefits of approximately of the current plan participants were frozen upon allied s acquisition of bfi in our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of and irc  as amended by the pension protection act of no contributions were required during the last three years and no contributions are anticipated for the plan s assets are invested as determined by our retirement benefits committee 
at december   the plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds  equity funds and cash 
we annually review and adjust the plan s asset allocation as deemed necessary 
residual risk changes in the plan s investment mix and performance of the equity and bond markets and fund managers could impact the amount of pension income or expense recorded  the funded status of the plan and the need for future cash contributions 
assumptions 
the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates  expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases 
our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary 
we determine the discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date 
where that timing does not correspond to a published high quality bond rate  our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate 
the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability 
if the discount rate increases by  our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately million 
if the discount rate were to decrease by  our benefit obligation would increase by approximately million 
in developing our expected rate of return assumption  we evaluate long term expected and historical returns on the plan assets  giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the plan obligations 
the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned 
less than of participants in the plan continue to earn service benefits 
residual risks our assumed discount rate is sensitive to changes in market based interest rates 
a decrease in the discount rate will increase our related benefit plan obligation 
our annual pension expense would be impacted if the actual return on plan assets were to vary from the expected return

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the table below provides information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor 
we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
all items described below are non trading 
expected maturity date fair value of asset liability as of december  thereafter total fixed rate debt amount outstanding in millions average interest rates variable rate debt amount outstanding in millions average interest rates interest rate swaps fixed to variable notional amount in millions average pay rate average receive rate the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value  since interest rates are variable and  thus  approximate current market rates 
fuel price risk fuel costs represent a significant operating expense 
when economically practical  we may enter into new or renewal contracts  or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk 
where appropriate  we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs 
while we charge these fees to a majority of our customers  we are unable to charge such fees to all customers 
consequently  an increase in fuel costs results in an increase in our cost of operations  a smaller increase in our revenue from the fuel recovery fee and a decrease in our operating margin percentage  since the increase in revenue is more than offset by the increase in cost 
conversely  a decrease in fuel costs results in a decrease in our cost of operations  a smaller decrease in our revenue and an increase in our operating margin percentage 
at our current consumption levels  a one cent change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately million on an annual basis  which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers 
accordingly  a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 
our operations also require the use of certain petroleum based products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of oil 
an increase in the price of oil could increase the cost of those products  which would increase our operating and capital costs 
we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our vendors 
commodities prices we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our material recycling facilities 
as a result  changes in the market prices of these items will impact our results of operations 
revenue from sales of recycled cardboard and newspaper in  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively
