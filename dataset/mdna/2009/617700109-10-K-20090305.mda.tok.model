understanding our company our mission is to create great products that help investors reach their financial goals 
we offer an extensive line of internet  software  and print based products for individual investors  financial advisors  and institutional clients 
we also offer asset management services for advisors  institutions  and retirement plan participants 
many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements 
as a result  we typically generate recurring revenue 
we emphasize a decentralized approach to running our business to empower our managers and to create a culture of responsibility and accountability 
during and previous years  we operated our business in three global segments individual  advisor  and institutional 
in all three of these segments  we believe our work helps individual investors make better investment decisions 
historically  we have focused primarily on organic growth by introducing new products and services and marketing our existing products 
however  we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions that support our five key growth strategies  which are enhance our position in each of our key market segments by focusing on our three major internet based platforms  become a global leader in funds of funds investment management  continue building thought leadership in independent investment research  create a premier global investment database  and expand our international brand presence  products  and services 
graphic key business characteristics revenue we generate revenue by selling a variety of investment related products and services 
we sell many of our offerings  such as our newsletters  principia software  and premium service on morningstar 
com  via subscriptions 
these subscriptions are mainly offered for a one year term  although we also offer terms ranging from one month to three years 
we also sell advertising on our web sites throughout the world 
several of our other products are sold through license agreements  including morningstar advisor workstation  morningstar equity research  morningstar direct  retirement advice  and licensed data 
our license agreements typically range from one to three years 
for some of our other institutional services  mainly investment consulting  we generally base our fees on the scope of work and the level of service we provide and calculate them as a percentage of assets under advisement 
we also earn fees relating to morningstar managed portfolios and the managed retirement accounts offered through morningstar retirement manager and advice by ibbotson that we calculate as a percentage of assets under management 
overall  revenue tied to asset based fees accounted for about of our consolidated revenue in deferred revenue we frequently invoice our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers 
as a result  we use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development 
the businesses we acquired over the past several years have similar business models  and as a result  we acquired their deferred revenue 
deferred revenue is the largest liability on our consolidated balance sheets and totaled million as of december  and million as of december  we expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations under our subscription  license  and service agreements 
significant operating leverage our business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary databases and content 
we strive to leverage these costs by selling a wide variety of products and services to multiple investor segments  through multiple media  and in many geographic markets 
we believe that while the fixed costs of the investments in our business are relatively high  the variable cost of adding customers is considerably lower  particularly as a significant portion of our products and services focus on internet based platforms and assets under management 
at times  we will make investments in building our databases and content that will hurt our short term operating results 
during other periods  our profitability will improve because we re able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate 
when revenue decreases  however  the significant operating leverage in our business may reduce our profitability 
in general  our businesses have high fixed costs  and we expect our revenue to increase or decrease more quickly than our expenses 
operating expense we classify our operating expense into separate categories for cost of goods sold  development  sales and marketing  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization  as described below 
we include stock based compensation expense  as appropriate  in each of these categories 
cost of goods sold 
this category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers 
for example  this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports 
cost of goods sold also includes other expense such as postage  printing  and cd rom replication  as well as shareholder servicing fees for morningstar managed portfolios 
development 
this category mainly includes compensation expense for programmers  designers  and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products 
in some cases  we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain development projects 
this reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category 
we amortize these capitalized costs over the estimated economic life of the software  which is generally three years  and include this expense in depreciation and amortization 
sales and marketing 
this category includes compensation expense for our sales teams  product managers  and other marketing professionals 
we also include the cost of advertising  direct mail campaigns  and other marketing programs to promote our products 
general and administrative 
this category consists mainly of compensation expense for each segment s management team  as well as human resources  finance  and support employees for each segment 
the category also includes compensation expense for senior management and other corporate costs  including corporate systems  finance and accounting  legal  and facilities expense 
depreciation and amortization 
our capital expenditures consist mainly of computers  leasehold improvements  and capitalized product development costs related to certain software development projects 
we depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight line method based on the useful life of the asset  which ranges from three to seven years 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives  whichever is shorter 
we amortize capitalized product development costs over their estimated economic life  which is generally three years 
we also include amortization related to intangible assets  which is mainly driven by acquisitions  in this category 
international operations we have majority owned operations in countries outside of the united states and include these in our consolidated financial statements 
we account for our minority owned investments in japan  korea  denmark  and sweden using the equity method 
how we evaluate our business when our analysts evaluate a stock  they focus on assessing the company s estimated intrinsic value the value of the company s future cash flows  discounted to their worth in today s dollars 
our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way 
our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time  which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders 
we do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence the stock price  or to take actions that help us meet short term forecasts but may not be in the long term interest of building shareholder value 
we provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time revenue  operating income loss  and free cash flow  which we define as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures 
free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under securities and exchange commission sec regulations 
we present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time 
our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate the performance of our business 
free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure of performance required under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered an indicator of our overall financial performance or liquidity 
moreover  the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
to evaluate how successful we ve been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue  we calculate a retention rate 
we use two different methods for calculating retention 
for subscription based products including our print newsletters  morningstar 
com premium membership service  and principia software  we track the number of subscriptions retained during the year 
for products sold through contracts and licenses  we use the contract value method  which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period 
we include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount  unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify 
we also include variable fee contracts in this calculation and use the previous quarter s actual revenue as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage 
the retention rate excludes setup and customization fees  migrations to other morningstar products  and contract renewals that were pending as of january  the year in review industry overview we monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry on an ongoing basis 
we use these insights to help inform our company strategy  product development plans  and marketing initiatives 
investment landscape  research  and data the year was one of the most turbulent times on record in the past years 
the ongoing financial crisis worsened throughout the year as high profile investment bank lehman brothers declared bankruptcy  the us government took over mortgage lenders fannie mae and freddie mac  financial firms received large cash infusions and guarantees from the us government  the federal reserve began lending directly to corporations to ease the credit crisis  and then president bush signed a billion financial rescue package into law 
other large investment banks underwent significant changes as several troubled firms were bought out and morgan stanley and goldman sachs chose to obtain bank charters  which subject them to strict banking regulations 
in response to these events  the us equity market suffered its worst performance since including a drop in the fourth quarter alone  the market declined for the year as measured by morningstar s us market index  a broad market benchmark 
many global markets also lost ground during the year  and bonds with the exception of treasuries also posted negative returns because of the market s flight to quality and fears about credit risk 
problems in the credit markets had widespread effects even on traditional safe havens such as money market funds and high grade commercial paper 
as the year progressed  market volatility and uncertainty became increasingly severe 
total us mutual fund assets dropped to trillion as of december  based on data from the investment company institute ici  compared with trillion as of december  because of the market downturn  stock mutual funds had negative net cash flows of about billion as investors moved into more conservative areas 
that was the highest level of annual redemptions over the year history tracked by the ici 
hybrid funds also had net redemptions for the year  although the decline was less severe than in stock funds 
money market funds  meanwhile  had net cash inflows of about billion for the year  despite the high profile news of one money market fund dropping below a net asset value 
interest in alternative asset classes  such as hedge funds  also suffered with the market downturn in based on information from morningstar s hedge fund database  we estimate that hedge funds had about billion in net outflows during  compared with about billion in net inflows in in december  hedge fund investment advisor bernard madoff was arrested for an alleged fraud involving billions of investor assets that were pooled and used to pay off other investors 
madoff s clients reportedly included numerous hedge funds and international banks 
we believe these events are significant because of their likely negative impact on investor confidence in hedge funds 
lawmakers recently proposed a hedge fund transparency act  which would increase filing and record keeping requirements for hedge funds and require them to operate as regulated investment companies 
as debate about hedge fund regulation continues  we are continuing our efforts to improve transparency in the hedge fund industry 
assets in other areas also declined amid the global market downturn 
based on data from cerulli associates  assets invested in separate accounts totaled about billion as of december   down from billion as of december  based on our data  we estimate that total assets invested in variable annuities totaled about trillion as of september   down about from the same period in despite the severe market downturn  exchange traded funds etfs did not suffer large asset losses 
while total etf assets declined slightly to billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  based on data from the ici  net issuance was still positive for the year 
during  the number of us based etfs rose to more than  compared with about previously 
etfs have gained share from mutual funds in some areas of the market and have also become more popular in defined contribution plans  such as k s 
to meet greater investor demand for information on etfs  we have continued to increase analyst coverage in this area and now cover about etfs 
we also launched a new etf module for principia in individual investor market based on research from nielsen netratings  total page views to retail investment web sites increased for the year over most of the large portal sites displayed large gains while the smaller niche sites had smaller increases or even decreases in page views 
the number of unique users for retail investment web sites increased by compared with based on nielsen s data 
for morningstar 
com  unique users increased over page views for morningstar 
com were down by over because of reduced traffic to some areas of the site during the market downturn 
morningstar 
com continued to perform better than most competing sites  though  based on metrics such as time spent per visit and the number of pages viewed per visit 
because of the uncertain economic environment  some industry surveys indicate that many investment management firms plan to reduce their marketing budgets in as a result  online advertising has been under pressure  particularly in the financial sector 
in response to the difficult market for advertising sales  we are continuing our efforts to develop value added content and ad sales inventory on morningstar 
com 
financial advisor market the turmoil in the financial markets led to widespread job cuts in a variety of areas in based on data from executive search firm heidrick struggles and published in the new york times  total employment on wall street declined by  over the months ending december  that total reflects job losses for a variety of areas  a smaller portion of which includes financial advisors 
however  industry consolidation also led to a reduction in financial advisors employed by large brokerage firms in with fewer financial advisors employed by large firms  more advisors have been moving to independent distributors 
we believe the shift toward financial advisors becoming independent has led to greater demand for prepackaged portfolio and asset management solutions often referred to as turnkey asset management programs 
we offer these solutions through our morningstar managed portfolios service 
we introduced three additional select stock baskets in  as well as a series of mutual fund portfolios aimed at different stages of retirement with varying drawdown needs 
institutional market numerous firms in the financial services sector consolidated in for example  wells fargo purchased wachovia  barclays bought many of the assets of lehman brothers following lehman s bankruptcy filing in september  bank of america purchased merrill lynch  and jp morgan chase acquired both washington mutual and bear stearns 
several companies in the financial services sector outside of the united states were also acquired during the year 
when our clients are acquired  the impact on us may be positive  negative  or neutral 
we may lose business following an acquisition of one of our clients  but we also often have opportunities to continue providing services or expand our business with the new parent organization 
we are actively monitoring business conditions for all of our major clients and continuing to work closely with them to align our products and services to meet their needs 
because of the market downturn and asset losses from redemptions  many institutional firms have been under pressure to reduce costs 
this trend has had a negative impact on new and renewal business 
however  we are also working to adapt our offerings to help institutions reduce costs 
for example  we introduced a new business process outsourcing service in  which we expect to market to institutions seeking to reduce their technology processing costs 
other major trends in the institutional market include continued growth in target date funds as a default investment option in retirement plans 
this trend has been driven by new department of labor rules that define guidelines for qualified default investment options for automatic enrollment in defined contribution plans 
despite the overall net outflows from mutual funds in  target date funds had net inflows of close to billion for the year based on data from strategic insight 
in response  we have continued to expand the range of data we provide on target date funds 
our ibbotson associates unit has begun working with large defined contribution plans to build custom target date portfolios based on their unique plan participant demographics 
the solution uses the plan s existing investment options 
this allows us to customize the portfolios based on participants overall time horizon and risk preferences 
in november  the sec voted to require a summary prospectus and electronic prospectus delivery for mutual funds 
we are offering services to meet these compliance needs through our global document library product  which we launched in late worldwide markets because of the global credit crisis and economic downturn  asset management firms around the world were also in turmoil in several major banks in the united kingdom  the netherlands  iceland  and germany accepted government funding to rescue their operations 
some banks spun off their asset management operations  and numerous asset management firms were purchased by other firms 
some fund markets had large asset outflows in as investors sought refuge in lower risk areas  such as bank deposits 
for example  italy and spain had combined asset outflows of about billion in the third quarter of in australia  regulators placed restrictions on investors ability to withdraw money from many funds holding mortgage backed securities 
we believe this is significant because it demonstrates the wide ranging impact of poor market liquidity on individual investors and the level of confidence they have in investing in funds 
in canada  the government created a new tax free savings account program that allows individuals to invest money without paying taxes upon withdrawal similar to the roth ira in the united states 
similarly  the kiwisaver plan introduced in new zealand in has prompted more individual investors to invest in mutual funds 
we are continuing to develop new data and tools to meet investors needs for information in these and other markets  and we plan to launch a web site for new zealand based individual investors in in germany  the market downturn led to outflows in equity and fixed income funds  particularly in october 
the liquidity crisis also led to several direct real estate funds being closed 
during the credit crisis  the government implemented new guarantees for savings deposits  leading to greater competition for money market funds and other lower risk vehicles 
conclusion overall  we believe the disruption in the financial markets continues to cause widespread investor uncertainty 
the market downturn has also led to spending cutbacks among asset management firms and other financial services companies 
the financial crisis has had two main effects on our business lengthening the sales cycle and increasing pressure on renewal pricing 
with new business  we ve been seeing longer sales cycles  tightening budgets  and more review by senior management at client organizations 
we ve also seen some pressure on renewal and retention rates  which both declined from previous levels in on the positive side  many of our contracts have multiyear terms  and we believe the services we provide are fairly entrenched within many areas of our clients organizations 
these two factors have mitigated the effect of the downturn on our business to some extent 
overall  we remain cautious because of the difficult and uncertain market environment 
however  we re continuing to invest in our business and manage it for the long term 
we re also looking for business opportunities that may emerge from the current crisis 
performance summary our revenue grew to more than million in  and operating income rose to million 
we generated free cash flow of about million and maintained a healthy balance sheet with nearly million in cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
however  our organic growth decelerated during the year and dipped below zero in the fourth quarter  largely because of lower revenue from our investment consulting business 
about of our revenue base is tied to asset based fees  so the severe market downturn had a negative impact on revenue 
because many of our clients have been cutting back on spending  new business and renewals in other parts of the company also suffered in the latter part of the year 
because the current economic environment is so uncertain  we ve taken steps to reduce our cost structure in mainly by reducing employee benefit costs and bonus expense 
we re continuing to invest in our business  though  and believe we ll be well positioned when conditions improve 
the list below summarizes the key accomplishments and challenges that our management team has highlighted related to our performance accomplishments we completed six acquisitions  four of which were outside the united states 
we invested million for these acquisitions  which represent approximately million in annual revenue 
we continued to invest in our global investment databases  with significantly improved stock data coverage as well as new mutual fund databases in several markets outside the united states 
we also expanded our business to include global real time price data from uk based tenfore systems limited  a strategic acquisition 
we now provide data on more than  investments  up from about  a year ago 
we made numerous enhancements to our major product platforms  including a new home page and site relaunch for morningstar 
com  a new etf module for principia  a new alternative investment edition for morningstar direct  and several new managed portfolios through morningstar investment services 
total licenses for morningstar direct and morningstar advisor workstation grew and  respectively  compared with the prior year 
our ibbotson associates unit entered into new funds of funds relationships across a variety of client types and strategies  which will help support future growth 
we created a new organizational structure effective january  that will help us further globalize our operations and better align the business with our key growth strategies 
the table on page contains more information about the new structure and changes to our operating segments 
international revenue rose to million and represented of consolidated revenue in percentage points more than in challenges the market downturn has been severe and has hit many of our clients in the financial services industry hard 
because of the difficult economic environment  we ve also experienced slower growth in new business  increased pressure on renewal spending  and cutbacks on internet advertising 
this challenging environment has persisted into the first quarter of we ve seen a sharp drop in asset based fees because of the global market downturn  mainly in our investment consulting business 
in addition  during  one of our investment consulting clients informed us that it was not planning to renew its contract 
as a result  assets under advisement for morningstar associates declined more than the market for the year 
also  in the first quarter of  we did not reach an agreement on renewal terms with another consulting client 
combined  these contracts represented about million of revenue in the independent equity research we re providing to six banks under the terms of the global analyst research settlement made up about of our consolidated revenue in after the settlement period expires in july  these banks will no longer be required to provide independent investment research to their clients 
we don t know how much of this business we ll retain after the settlement period expires  and we expect this research revenue to decline significantly 
consolidated results change change revenue operating income operating margin pp pp cash used for investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow pp percentage point s as noted in how we evaluate our business  we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures 
we present free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after we spend money to operate our business 
because we have made several acquisitions in recent years  comparing our financial results from year to year is complex 
to make it easier for investors to compare our results in different periods  we provide information on both organic revenue and revenue from acquisitions 
we include an acquired operation as part of our revenue from acquisitions for months after we complete the acquisition 
after that  we include it as part of our organic revenue 
consolidated organic revenue revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations is considered a non gaap financial measure 
the definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 
organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under gaap 
the table below shows the periods in which we included each acquired operation in revenue from acquisitions acquisition hemscott data  media  and investor relations web site businesses january through december  financial computer support  inc september through december  fundamental data limited october through december  k wizard technology  llc december through december  tenfore systems limited december through december  investdata proprietary limited december through december  mutual fund data business from standard poor s january through march  march through december  hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce  inc january through july  august through december  aspect huntley pty limited january through july  july through december  ibbotson associates  inc january through february  march through december  consolidated revenue in  our consolidated revenue increased to million

acquisitions also expanded our revenue in  with the majority driven by the hemscott businesses we acquired in january as a whole  acquisitions contributed million  or percentage points  to our consolidated revenue growth in our consolidated revenue increased to million in from strong organic growth as well as new revenue from acquisitions  the majority of which was from the fund data business we acquired from standard poor s in march acquired operations contributed million of revenue and represented percentage points of our consolidated revenue growth in organic revenue growth was million  or  in  which was significantly lower than our organic growth rate in and our organic growth rate in the severe market downturn in the latter part of caused our organic growth rate to decelerate during the year and dip below zero in the fourth quarter

in both and  our growth was diversified by segment  with all three segments contributing to revenue growth 
however  the institutional segment  which makes up more than half of our consolidated revenue  generated approximately two thirds of our company wide revenue increase in acquisitions contributed million to institutional segment revenue in the institutional segment was also the main contributor to revenue gains in  accounting for about of the change in revenue before eliminating intersegment revenue 
acquisitions contributed million to institutional segment revenue in our two other segments also contributed to revenue growth  though to a lesser degree 
advisor segment revenue rose million  or  in  accounting for approximately of the revenue increase before eliminating intersegment revenue 
acquisitions contributed million to advisor segment revenue in advisor segment revenue rose approximately in  with acquisitions contributing million of the revenue increase 
individual segment revenue increased million  or  in and million  or  in acquisitions contributed approximately million to the individual segment in and million in graphic on a product level  morningstar advisor workstation was the largest contributor to organic revenue growth in total licenses for morningstar advisor workstation in the united states were up as of december  the year over year growth in advisor workstation revenue was mainly driven by adding additional functionality and users for existing clients  as well as growth in new clients 
while advisor workstation licenses were up year over year  they were up only slightly in the fourth quarter of compared with third quarter levels because of the market downturn 
some of our clients reduced the number of users because of staff reductions or other efforts to lower costs 
advisor workstation was the second largest driver of our organic revenue increase in  as total licenses in the united states increased by about in growth during and in reflects additional users at existing clients  changes in the scope of some contracts  and new clients 
licensed data and morningstar direct were also major contributors to organic growth in licensed data revenue was driven by both new clients and higher contract values for existing clients 
total licenses for morningstar direct rose during the year  including continued strong growth outside the united states 
in  licensed data was the third largest contributor to organic revenue growth  driven by both new clients and higher contract values for existing clients 
because of the impact of acquisitions and organic growth  licensed data now ranks as our largest product based on revenue 
several of our recent acquisitions have added to our licensed data business 
for example  licensed data revenue in included additional business from aspect huntley and the fund data business acquired from standard poor s  while revenue included additional revenue from hemscott  fundamental data  and others 
investment consulting was the largest driver behind organic revenue growth in  but this trend reversed in much of our investment consulting business focuses on asset allocation services that we provide for funds of funds  where we typically act as a portfolio consultant or portfolio construction manager 
assets under advisement decreased about in after rising in excluding specific changes from client retention and renewals  changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance  and net inflows or outflows caused when investors or institutions add to or redeem shares from these portfolios 
the us equity market declined about in  and our total assets under advisement declined about 
since september   our assets under advisement have declined 
because about of our consolidated revenue is tied to asset based fees  the market decline has had a negative impact on revenue for investment consulting 
in addition  during the second quarter of  an investment consulting client informed us that it was not planning to renew its contract 
as a result  assets under management for morningstar associates declined more than the market for the year 
also  in the first quarter of  we did not reach an agreement on renewal terms with another consulting client 
combined  these contracts represented about million of revenue in revenue from international operations increased as a percentage of total revenue in and our non us revenue increased to of consolidated revenue in percentage points higher than in the fund data business acquired from standard poor s  the hemscott data business  and the more recently acquired fundamental data limited and tenfore systems limited all have extensive operations outside the united states 
revenue from international operations grew million  or  to million in  with acquisitions contributing million of the increase 
in  revenue from international operations increased million  or  to million 
approximately of this revenue increase came from acquisitions  primarily the fund data business acquired from standard poor s 
foreign currency translations had a much smaller  but still favorable  impact on international revenue in both and foreign currency translations contributed million of the increase in non us revenue in and million in excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations  our non us revenue increased in and in international organic revenue international revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations is considered a non gaap financial measure

investment consulting became our largest product in and remained there in  but moved to second largest in organic growth as well as new revenue from acquisitions helped licensed data became our largest product in after rising to the second largest product in acquisition revenue included hemscott in and aspect huntley and the mutual fund data business acquired from standard poor s in top five products segment revenue of consolidated revenue licensed data institutional investment consulting institutional advisor workstation advisor morningstar

com individual principia advisor as discussed in how we evaluate our business  we calculate retention and renewal rates to help measure how successful we ve been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue 
the following graph illustrates these two metrics over the past four years graphic in  we estimate that our retention rate for subscription based products  such as principia  morningstar 
com premium membership service  and print and online newsletters  averaged between and  down from to in for contract based products and services  we estimate that our weighted average renewal rate was on the low end of the range between and and was down about percentage points from our renewal rate in the decline in renewal rates in was largely driven by lower assets in investment consulting and  to a smaller extent  a lower renewal rate for advisor workstation in the latter part of the year 
the figure for contract based products includes the impact of price changes and changes to the contract value upon renewal  as well as changes in the value of variable fee contracts 
the renewal rate for contract based products and services in was consistent with  but still lower than consolidated operating expense operating expense change of revenue change pp pp pp our consolidated operating expense increased million  or  in compensation related expense  excluding bonuses  accounted for two thirds of the increase in  mainly because of a increase in worldwide headcount and higher sales commission expense 
lower bonus expense partially offset the increase in these costs 
we had approximately  employees worldwide as of december   compared with  as of december  approximately half of the growth in headcount was from acquisitions 
in addition  in we hired employees for the morningstar development program  a two year rotational training program for entry level college graduates 
bonus expense declined million because of lower growth in our financial performance compared with the previous year 
changes in the size of our bonus pool are based on changes in full year operating income growth relative to the previous year 
the size of the bonus pool varies each year  and we review it and update it quarterly 
excluding compensation related expense and bonus expense  operating expense increased million in about one third of this operating expense increase was from higher lease expense for our new headquarters and other global offices 
during  we recorded lease expense for our new headquarters as well as for our former headquarters  which was occupied until december depreciation and amortization rose million in  and we incurred additional costs across all operating expense categories from acquisitions 
higher costs in these areas were partially offset by lower legal and professional fees  which declined million 
in  we recorded million in expense related to the settlement of litigation in australia 
in addition  we had about million in product implementation costs for advice by ibbotson in that did not recur in as a percentage of revenue  operating expense in declined percentage points 
in  our consolidated operating expense increased million 
two key factors impacted all of our operating expense categories in compensation related costs including incentive compensation and acquisitions 
compensation related expense  mainly including salaries  benefits  and sales commissions  increased million in because of increased headcount  as well as annual salary increases 
we had approximately  employees worldwide as of december   compared with approximately  as of december  bonus expense recorded in increased million because of improvements in our financial performance  as well as increased headcount 
excluding compensation related expense  general and administrative expense increased million in we incurred additional costs from acquisitions  including transition costs  rent and facilities expense  and professional fees 
we also incurred million of expense related to settling our australian litigation 
we had higher amortization expense in and because of acquisitions 
this item contributed million to the increase in operating expense in and million to the operating expense increase in we expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost through the useful lives of these assets  which generally range from two to years 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold change of revenue change pp pp pp gross profit change gross margin change pp pp pp cost of goods sold is our largest category of operating expense  accounting for more than one third of our total operating expense over the past three years 
our business relies heavily on human capital  and cost of goods sold includes the compensation expense for employees who produce our products and services 
cost of goods sold increased million in three quarters of the increase was driven by higher compensation expense  excluding incentive compensation  which was partly offset by a reduction in product implementation expense 
in  we recorded million for outsourced product implementation expense associated with the advice by ibbotson service 
these costs did not recur in incremental costs from acquisitions contributed to the higher compensation expense  and were the largest contributor to the remainder of the cost increases 
incentive compensation in was about the same as in cost of goods sold increased million in approximately two thirds of the growth was due to higher compensation expense  including incentive compensation 
these costs rose because of continued hiring as well as additional headcount from acquisitions 
acquisitions also contributed the largest portion of the remaining growth in cost of goods sold 
outsourced product implementation expense associated with the advice by ibbotson service was million lower in compared with  which offset some of the growth in other expenses 
over the past three years  our gross margin has increased to in from in  as revenue growth has outpaced growth in cost of goods sold 
the gross margin improved at a faster pace in than in because of a stronger business environment in development expense development expense change of revenue change pp pp pp development expense increased million in development expense as a percentage of revenue in was consistent with after declining about percentage points in  when bonus costs included in this category increased at a lower rate than in sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense change of revenue change pp pp pp sales and marketing expense increased million in and million in higher compensation expense  including sales commissions  was the main contributor to the change in both periods 
in addition  we had incremental costs from acquisitions because of growth in headcount and the number of products and services sold 
as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expense has been similar over the past three years  but increased slightly in compared with a small decline in general and administrative expense general and administrative expense change of revenue change pp pp pp general and administrative g a expense increased million in as lease costs grew 
in  lease costs rose because we recorded lease expense for our new headquarters as well as for the former headquarters building we occupied until december compensation expense also increased  but was offset by the favorable impact of lower bonus expense in this cost category 
increases in this cost category were also offset by a million reduction in legal and professional fees 
as a percentage of revenue  g a expense declined percentage points in  reflecting the reduction in compensation expense  including bonus  and legal fees as a percentage of revenue 
in  the million increase in g a was mainly driven by higher compensation and bonus expense 
in addition  we incurred additional costs in our operations outside the united states primarily from temporary transition costs associated with the fund data operations acquired from standard poor s 
incremental costs from acquisitions in the united states  including rent and professional fees  also added to the increase in this category 
an expense of million related to settling our australian litigation also contributed to the growth in g a 
because of these additional costs  g a increased slightly as a percentage of revenue in after declining significantly in depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense amortization expense total depreciation and amortization expense change of revenue change pp pp pp depreciation and amortization expense rose million in and million in as amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions increased substantially 
as a percentage of revenue  however  this category of expense has remained consistent in recent years 
we expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost for the remaining life of the assets 
we estimate that aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets will be million in our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by changes to the preliminary purchase price allocations associated with our acquisitions 
stock based compensation expense restricted stock units stock options stock based compensation expense change of revenue change pp pp pp stock based compensation expense increased million in and million in and declined slightly as a percentage of revenue in both years 
we include stock based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories 
we began granting restricted stock units rsus in may and made additional grants in and  primarily in the second quarter of each year 
we recognize the expense related to rsus over the vesting period  which is generally four years 
our stock based compensation expense related to rsus has increased over the past three years  reflecting the additional rsu grants 
in contrast  the stock based compensation expense related to stock options has declined over the past three years reflecting no stock option grants in  a small number of stock option grants in and  and that stock options granted prior to are becoming fully expensed 
we determine stock based compensation expense in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which we adopted on january  we record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that ultimately vest 
as a result  the stock based compensation expense recorded since the beginning of reflects an estimate of an expected forfeiture rate 
we usually adjust our estimate of the forfeiture rate in the second quarter  which is when most of our larger equity grants typically vest 
the adjustment recorded in the second quarter of was an expense of million  compared with an adjustment of million of expense recorded in the second quarter of based on grants made through december   we anticipate that stock based compensation expense will be million in this amount is subject to change based on additional equity grants or any change in our estimated forfeiture rate 
bonus expense bonus expense change of revenue change pp pp pp in  bonus expense declined about million  or  while revenue increased 
as a result  bonus expense declined to of revenue in  compared with in  reflecting the lower operating income growth in compared with bonus expense recorded in increased million driven by improved financial performance versus the prior year and incremental bonus expense from acquisitions 
the amount of bonus expense is not a fixed cost 
instead  changes in the size of our bonus pool will vary each year based on a number of items  including changes in full year operating income growth relative to the previous year and other factors 
we review and update our estimates and the bonus pool size quarterly 
we pay annual bonuses and include bonus expense in each of our operating expense categories 
as discussed in more detail below  we recently changed our bonus program for as part of our efforts to better align our cost structure with revenue in the challenging business environment 
consolidated operating income operating income change operating margin change pp pp pp consolidated operating income increased million in and million in in  the operating margin increased by percentage points partly because of lower bonus expense and legal expense as a percentage of revenue  as well as the million decline in product implementation expense associated with the advice by ibbotson service 
higher lease expense as a percentage of revenue offset these positive factors and contributed to the lower operating margin growth compared with the two previous years 
incremental costs added by acquisitions  such as amortization of intangible assets and higher compensation costs  also contributed to slower growth in the operating margin 
in and  our operating margin expanded more dramatically because of more moderate growth in cost of goods sold and development expense 
we also realized operating leverage from revenue growth in products with higher fixed costs  where the costs typically don t increase or decrease as quickly as revenue  such as investment consulting  morningstar advisor workstation  licensed data  and morningstar 
com 
importantly  the annual operating margin reflects a mix of higher operating margins early in the year and lower margins in the latter part of the year  which worsened as the business environment became more challenging 
our operating margin was in the fourth quarter of  compared with in fourth quarter of to better align operating expense with revenue in this challenging business environment  we ve taken a number of steps to reduce our cost structure in mainly by reducing employee benefit costs and bonus expense 
while cost reductions began in  the largest reductions were effective january  we are reducing our single largest discretionary cost  bonus expense  with changes to the bonus plan in we also suspended matching contributions to our k program in the united states  which accounted for about million of expense in we have also suspended salary increases  postponed most new hiring  and are cutting expenses in other areas such as travel 
in addition  about million of lease related costs will not recur in future quarters because we will no longer incur lease costs for both our new and former corporate headquarters in chicago 
graphic consolidated free cash flow we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures 
free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure 
the definition of free cash flow we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under gaap 
we generated positive free cash flow in both and our free cash flow of million in reflects cash provided by operating activities of million and capital expenditures of million

free cash flow rose million in  reflecting a million increase in cash provided by operating activities  which was offset by a million increase in capital expenditures 
free cash flow increased million in  reflecting a million increase in cash flow provided by operating activities  which was offset by a million increase in capital expenditures 
cash provided by operating activities increased million in the increase resulted from the positive impact of higher net income adjusted for non cash items of million and an increase in deferred rent of million 
these increases were offset by the impact of higher cash paid for bonuses of million and a decrease in the impact of accrued income taxes and accrued compensation 
deferred rent includes the tenant improvement allowance received in connection with the build out of our new headquarters 
the tenant improvement allowance will be amortized over the lease term as a reduction in office lease expense 
cash provided by operating activities increased million in cash provided by operating activities benefited from the positive impact of higher net income adjusted for non cash items of million  an increase in accrued compensation of million  and an increase in taxes payable of million  all offset by higher cash paid for bonuses of million and higher cash paid for taxes of million 
our tax payments were reduced as a result of a million cash tax benefit we received related to the ibbotson acquisition  which was fully used during in  capital expenditures were million  an increase of million from the previous year 
the increase was almost entirely driven by capital expenditures for our new headquarters in chicago 
in  the million in capital expenditures mainly consisted of leasehold improvement for new office space in canada  europe  and australia  computer hardware to keep our operations up and running in the event of a disaster  and design work related to our new headquarters in chicago 
free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was in  in  and in to provide investors with additional insight into our financial results  we provide a comparison between the increase in net income with the change in cash flow provided by operating activities change change net income adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash flows from operating activities excess tax benefits in accordance with sfas no

the tenant improvement allowance of million received in connection with the build out of our new headquarters represented a significant benefit to cash flow in  which is not expected to recur 
beginning in  as the tenant improvement allowance is amortized over the lease term as a reduction in office lease expense  this will represent a deduction from net income to arrive at cash provided by operating activities 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in was million less than the million increase in net income 
non cash items included in net income were a primary driver of the difference between net income and cash provided by operations in we had an additional million of excess tax benefits primarily because of an increase in the number of stock options exercised and the higher stock price on the date of these exercises 
changes in net operating assets and liabilities in total were flat when comparing to  but many individual line items changed significantly 
cash paid for bonuses increased million and cash paid for taxes increased million  while accrued compensation and income taxes payable increased by million and million  respectively  and offset these higher cash payments 
sfas no 
r  share based payment  requires that we classify excess tax benefits as a financing activity  which contributes to the difference between net income and cash from operations 
in   and we classified million  million  and million of excess tax benefits  respectively  as financing activities 
we describe these excess tax benefits in the liquidity and capital resources section

our equity analyst team  whose compensation costs are included in cost of goods sold  grew to as of december   compared with as of december   and as of december  the change in operating expense also reflects additional expense from the hemscott acquisition in and the aspect huntley and ibbotson acquisitions in the segment s margin rose percentage points in to as most operating expenses other than lease and compensation expense declined as a percentage of revenue 
the segment s margin declined by percentage points in  reflecting lower margins associated with the aspect huntley operations and an increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue 
sales and marketing costs rose because of expanded direct mail campaigns in the first quarter and additions to our sales staff during the year 
bonus expense increased in  particularly in cost of goods sold  and also contributed to operating expense growth in advisor segment our advisor segment focuses on products and services for financial advisors 
key products in this segment based on revenue are morningstar advisor workstation  morningstar principia  morningstar managed portfolios  and financial communications 
advisor workstation is a web based investment planning system that provides financial advisors with a comprehensive set of tools for conducting their core business 
advisor workstation is available in two editions the office edition for independent financial advisors and the enterprise edition for financial advisors affiliated with larger firms 
principia is our cd rom based investment research and planning software for financial advisors 
morningstar managed portfolios is a fee based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund  exchange traded fund  and stock portfolios tailored to meet a range of investment time horizons and risk levels that financial advisors can use for their clients taxable and tax deferred accounts

in   and  this segment represented  before intersegment eliminations    and  respectively  of our consolidated revenue 
graphic in and in  revenue for the advisor segment increased million and million  respectively 
acquisitions contributed million to revenue growth in and million to revenue growth in excluding acquisitions  nearly all of the increase in revenue in and the majority of the increase in were driven by morningstar advisor workstation 
the number of us licenses for morningstar advisor workstation increased to  as of december   compared with  as of december   and  as of december  the revenue growth reflects new client contracts as well as additional users and functionality for existing clients 
part of this growth reflects expansions in the scope of some contracts to full site licenses where we include all eligible advisors in our total license count  from tools only licenses where we include a smaller number of advisors based on actual usage 
the increase in users from the prior year was also driven by the growth of users at existing clients and new clients 
in addition  we also experienced strong renewals for the product during and and several contracts that were scheduled to expire renewed at significantly higher price points  reflecting both higher user counts and an increase in the amount of functionality licensed 
morningstar managed portfolios revenue was flat in and contributed to revenue growth in  but to a lesser degree than advisor workstation 
assets under management for morningstar managed portfolios fell to billion as of december   compared with billion as of december   resulting from general market weakness 
assets under management were billion as of december  principia revenue was down slightly in and flat in the number of subscriptions for principia was  as of december   a decrease from  as of december  the decline in the number of subscriptions partly reflects clients migrating from principia to advisor workstation  but also reflects a retention rate decline as the economic environment weakened during the year

operating expense rose in cost of goods sold and compensation related expense accounted for most of the change in operating expense in operating expense increased million  or  in compensation related expense including incentive compensation and commissions accounted for about of the change in operating expense 
the remainder of the operating expense growth was from higher general and administrative expense as well as growth in cost of goods sold 
incremental costs added primarily from the fund data business acquired from standard poor s also accounted for a portion of the increase across all cost categories

the institutional segment represented  before intersegment eliminations    and of our consolidated revenue in   and  respectively 
graphic in  revenue for the institutional segment increased million 
acquisitions contributed approximately million  representing approximately percentage points of the segment s revenue growth rate 
licensed data was also a major contributor to organic revenue growth in the segment  as demand for data feeds and other services remained strong for most of during the fourth quarter  licensed data revenue declined slightly compared with third quarter levels 
morningstar direct also contributed to the increase in segment revenue in the number of licenses for morningstar direct totaled  worldwide as of december   up compared with  as of december  investment consulting  which has been a leading contributor to revenue growth in recent years  slowed considerably in  and revenue was relatively flat year over year 
total assets under advisement for investment consulting declined approximately  as assets under advisement from morningstar associates declined and assets under advisement from ibbotson associates decreased about 
excluding changes related to contract cancellations or renewals  changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance  and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios 
in  both factors contributed to growth in assets under advisement  but increases in net inflows were the main driver behind the asset growth 
in  the us stock market fell about and was the main factor behind the decline in assets for most portfolios 
in addition  during the second quarter of  an investment consulting client informed us that it was not planning to renew its contract in october as a result  assets under advisement for morningstar associates declined more than the market for the year 
also  in the first quarter of  we did not reach agreement on renewal terms with another consulting client 
combined  these contracts represented about million of revenue in we provided advisory services on approximately billion in assets as of december   compared with approximately billion as of december  and billion as of december  these totals include consulting relationships as well as agreements where we act as a portfolio construction manager for a mutual fund or variable annuity and receive a basis point fee 
we also provide investment consulting services for some assets under management for which we receive a flat fee 
in  revenue for the institutional segment increased million 
acquisitions contributed million  primarily from the fund data business acquired from standard poor s  and to a lesser extent from ibbotson  aspect huntley  and the hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce 
on a product level  the revenue expansion was driven by investment consulting  which contributed about of the total increase in segment revenue  driven by substantial growth in assets under advisement mainly among existing clients 
excluding revenue from acquisitions  licensed data and morningstar direct were the next largest contributors to revenue growth in both products have benefited from expanded sales efforts in europe and other markets outside the united states  as well as continued strength in the united states 
the number of licenses for morningstar direct increased to  worldwide as of december   compared with  as of december  retirement advice  morningstar encorr  and licensed tools and content were also contributors to revenue growth during and  although to a lesser extent 
the ibbotson acquisition significantly expanded our asset base in managed retirement accounts  and we are now one of the largest providers in this area

in  the segment s operating income increased million  or 
operating expense rose approximately million in and million in in both years  operating costs associated with acquisitions accounted for a significant portion of the increase 
this additional cost is included in all expense categories  but had the largest impact on compensation expense 
the expense increase was offset by lower bonus expense 
both and benefited from reduced product implementation fees related to our advice by ibbotson service 
our institutional segment operating margin was down slightly in at after improving percentage points in in  revenue growth exceeded the increase in operating expense  largely driven by revenue growth in our investment consulting business  which has high fixed costs 
this trend reversed dramatically in the latter half of when assets under advisement and revenue declined for the investment consulting business 
this trend was the major contributor to the segment s operating margin decline in the fourth quarter of  which offset operating margin gains earlier in the year 
in  lower general and administrative expense and bonus expense as a percentage of revenue had a favorable impact on the margin  offsetting the growth in nearly all other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
product implementation fees related to our advice by ibbotson service represented of revenue in  of revenue in  and of revenue in in addition  some of our acquired operations had a negative effect on the operating margin in corporate items and eliminations this category primarily includes amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded when we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions 
in addition  this category includes capitalized internal product development costs which results in a reduction of expense and related amortization expense 
the table below shows the components of corporate items and eliminations that impacted our consolidated operating income amortization expense depreciation expense other corporate items and eliminations change in and  corporate items and eliminations increased because of additional amortization expense related to intangible assets from acquisitions  partially offset by lower depreciation expense 
amortization of intangible assets increased million in and million in we have paid million for acquisitions during the past three years 
at december  and december   respectively  we had million and million recorded for intangible assets 
we amortize these intangible assets over their estimated lives  ranging from two to years 
based on acquisitions completed through december   we estimate that aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets will be million in some of the purchase price allocations are preliminary  and the values assigned to intangible assets and the associated amortization expense may change in future periods 
depreciation expense included in this category has declined over the past three years as computer equipment and internal product development costs  capitalized in previous years  are now fully depreciated 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  non operating income  and income tax expense equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities includes our portion of the net income loss of morningstar japan kk mjkk  morningstar korea  ltd  morningstar danmark a s  and morningstar sweden ab 
in   and  equity in net income of unconsolidated entities was primarily from our position in mjkk 
in  mjkk recorded a gain related to the sale of shares in a subsidiary s initial public offering 
our share of the pre tax gain was approximately million 
we describe our investments in unconsolidated entities in more detail in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
non operating income the following table presents the components of net non operating income interest income  net other expense  net non operating income net interest income mainly reflects interest from our investment portfolio 
net interest income decreased million in because of lower returns on our invested balances during the year 
net interest income increased million during we generated more interest income in because of higher balances for cash  cash equivalents  and investments in compared with  as well as higher returns on these invested balances 
other expense mainly reflects foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of business related to our non us operations  the minority interest in earnings of our consolidated entities  and realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio 
the larger expense in was influenced primarily by currency losses in the fourth quarter driven by a significantly stronger us dollar 
income tax expense the following table summarizes our effective income tax rate income before income taxes  equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  and cumulative effect of accounting change equity in net income of unconsolidated entities total income tax expense effective income tax rate our effective tax rate declined percentage points in the effective tax rate reflects the favorable  but variable  benefit from incentive stock option transactions and a decrease in our us state tax rate following a change in state tax law 
these reductions were partially offset by an increase in liabilities for certain tax positions in the company s us and us operations 
we are not able to anticipate the amount or timing of tax benefits related to incentive stock options 
incentive stock options impact our effective tax rate once a disqualifying disposition occurs 
a disqualifying disposition occurs when the option holder sells shares within one year of exercising an incentive stock option 
we receive a tax benefit when a disqualifying disposition occurs  which reduces our effective income tax rate 
in  our effective tax rate increased percentage points 
approximately half of the change was because of an increase to our overall us state tax rate and additional state income tax expense related to a change in state tax law enacted in because of this tax law change  we realize a lower tax benefit when we use our net deferred tax assets in future periods 
we therefore reduced the value of our deferred tax assets and recorded a corresponding increase to income tax expense as of the date of enactment 
the remainder of the change in our effective tax rate was because of an increase in unrecognized tax benefits 
for a reconciliation of the us federal tax rate to our effective income tax rate  refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had net operating loss nol carryforwards of million related to our non us operations and have recorded a valuation allowance against all but million of these nols 
because of the historical operating losses for certain non us operations  a valuation allowance is required because we do not believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to use all of our non us nols 
certain positions we have taken or intend to take on our us and non us tax returns may be reviewed by tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
as of december   we had approximately million of gross unrecognized tax benefits  of which million  if recognized  would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by million 
in  we expect changes to our liability for uncertain tax positions of approximately million for settlements with tax authorities and million for lapses of statutes of limitations 
it is not possible to estimate the impact of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits 
we anticipate that our effective income tax rate may continue to fluctuate related to the creation or reversal of valuation allowances for our non us operations as well as to changes in unrecognized tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources we believe our available cash balances and investments  along with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for the foreseeable future 
we invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments  consisting primarily of fixed income securities 
we maintain a conservative investment policy for our investments and invest a portion of these assets in municipal securities with high quality stand alone credit ratings 
the ongoing financial crisis  which accelerated during the latter half of  has heightened our application of a conservative investment policy  emphasizing principal preservation 
despite adverse conditions in the credit markets  which have also adversely affected traditionally safe investments such as money market funds and high grade commercial paper  we believe our investment portfolio remains marketable 
investments in our portfolio have a maximum maturity of two years  the weighted average maturity is approximately one year 
we intend to use our cash  cash equivalents  and investments for general corporate purposes  including working capital and for funding future growth 
to date we have not needed to access any significant commercial credit and have not attempted to borrow or establish any lines of credit 
during  we paid million for acquisitions with internally generated funds 
cash and cash equivalents as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million  an increase of million compared with the balance as of december  during  we were able to generate sufficient cash to more than offset payments related to acquisitions  bonuses  income taxes  and capital expenditures 
we also had sufficient cash on hand as of december  to make our annual bonus payments in february during the first quarter of  we made bonus payments of approximately million 
the payment includes approximately million of bonus expense recorded in and million of bonus payments deferred from the previous year 
in accordance with bonus program revisions adopted in january  we are not deferring payments on any bonus expense recorded for graphic cash provided by operating activities our main source of capital is cash generated from operating activities 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million driven by million of net income adjusted for non cash items and million of changes in our net operating assets and liabilities 
changes in our operating assets and liabilities mainly benefited from a million increase in deferred rent  a million increase in accrued compensation  and a million increase in income taxes payable 
during  bonus payments of approximately million and tax payments of million offset these cash flow benefits 
graphic in  cash provided by operating activities was million  driven by net income  adjusted for non cash items of million  and changes in our net operating assets and liabilities of million 
changes in net operating assets mainly benefited from a million increase in accrued compensation and a million increase in income taxes payable 
these benefits were offset by bonus payments of million and tax payments of million

tax payments in were reduced primarily because of the cash tax benefit we received from the ibbotson acquisition in  which was fully used during cash used for investing activities cash used for investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions  purchases of investments  net of proceeds from the sale of investments  and capital expenditures 
the level of cash used for investing activities can vary from period to period depending on the level of activity in these three categories 
cash used for investing activities was million in  million in  and million in cash used for a total of six acquisitions in  net of cash acquired  was million 
in  cash used for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  was million  primarily related to our acquisition of the fund data business from standard poor s 
in  we also paid cash to acquire the remaining share ownership in morningstar europe nv and to make the final payment related to the aspect huntley acquisition 
cash used for acquisitions in  net of cash acquired  was million 
this total includes cash used to purchase ibbotson in march  aspect huntley in july  and the hedge fund and separate account database division of investorforce in august cash used for acquisitions includes transaction costs directly related to the acquisitions 
purchases of investments  net of proceeds from the sale of investments  were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had investments  consisting primarily of fixed income securities  of and million  respectively 
as of december   our investments represented approximately of our total cash  cash equivalents  and investments  up percentage points compared to december  capital expenditures were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
capital expenditures are primarily for leasehold improvements  computer hardware  and computer software 
in  our capital expenditures were significantly higher than in previous years primarily because of the build out of our new headquarters in chicago 
tenant improvement allowances of million  which are included in cash provided by operating activities  reduced the total amount of cash we paid for the build out 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million in  significantly lower than the amount in cash provided by financing activities cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units 
excess tax benefits occur at the time a stock option is exercised when the intrinsic value of the option the difference between the fair value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option is greater than the fair value of the option at the time of grant 
similarly  excess tax benefits are generated upon vesting of restricted stock units when the market value of our common stock on the vesting date exceeds the grant price of the restricted stock units 
these excess tax benefits reduce the cash we pay for income taxes in the year they are recognized 
it is not possible to predict the timing of stock option exercises or the intrinsic value which will be achieved at the time options are exercised or upon vesting of restricted stock units 
as a result  we expect cash flow from financing activities to vary over time 
note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes additional information concerning stock options and restricted stock units outstanding as of december  in  cash provided by financing activities was million 
proceeds from stock option exercises totaled million and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units totaled million 
in  cash provided by financing activities decreased by million  or  compared with  driven mostly by a million decline in excess tax benefits 
the decrease was due primarily to a lower average stock price at the time the stock options were exercised 
in  cash provided by financing activities was million 
we received proceeds of million from stock option exercises 
we also recorded million for excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units 
in  cash provided by financing activities increased by million  or  compared with  driven almost entirely by an additional million of excess tax benefits 
the increase was due to a larger number of stock options exercised and the higher stock price on the date of these exercises 
employees exercised approximately million  million  and million stock options in   and  respectively 
the total intrinsic value the difference between the market value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option of options exercised during   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
acquisitions we invested million for six acquisitions in that in total have annual revenue of approximately million 
a description of our acquisitions during the past three years  including purchase price and product offerings  is contained in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
subsequent event operating structure and segment information beginning in  we are changing our organizational structure and operating segments 
under the new structure  morningstar has two operating segments investment information and investment management 
previously  we organized our operations based on three audience segments individual  advisor  and institutional 
the changes are effective january  the new structure organizes our operations according to product lines and growth strategies rather than audience segments 
the new investment information segment includes all of our data  software  and research products and services 
these products and services are typically sold through subscriptions or license agreements 
the investment management segment includes all of our asset management operations  which operate as registered investment advisors and earn the majority of their revenue from asset based fees 
in addition  under the previous segment reporting  we allocated costs for our corporate functions to each of the segments 
beginning in  we will no longer allocate corporate costs to our business segments 
the table below shows our segment data for   and based on the new organization structure change change revenue investment information investment management consolidated revenue operating income loss investment information investment management intangible amortization and corporate depreciation expense corporate unallocated consolidated operating income operating margin investment information pp pp investment management pp pp consolidated operating margin pp pp includes stock based compensation expense allocated to each segment 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expense  and related disclosures included in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions 
if actual amounts are different from previous estimates  we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition much of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for print publications  software  and internet based products and services 
we recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license  which generally ranges from one to three years 
we also provide analysis  consulting  retirement advice  and other services 
we recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract 
we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition  including whether fees are fixed or determinable and whether the collection of payment is probable 
for contracts that combine multiple products and services  we make judgments regarding the fair value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately 
delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite to the recognition of revenue 
if arrangements include an acceptance provision  we recognize revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance 
deferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions  licenses  or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue 
as of december   our deferred revenue was million 
we expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations 
the amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease primarily based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions 
the timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling of our service obligations 
we believe that the estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate  and to the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
purchase price allocation over the past several years  we have acquired companies that complement our business operations 
over the past three years  the total cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  was million 
for each acquisition  we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
we recognize the assets and liabilities acquired related to these acquisitions at their estimated fair values 
as of december   we allocated million of value to intangible assets primarily for customer related assets  intellectual property  and technology based assets 
the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets range from two to years 
as of december   we also have recorded million of goodwill arising from acquisitions 
management judgment is required in allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities 
we use judgment to identify the acquired assets  estimate the fair value of these assets  estimate the useful life of the assets  and assess the appropriate method for recognizing depreciation or amortization expense over the asset s useful life 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions impact the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our consolidated balance sheets  the amount of amortization and depreciation expense  if any  recorded in our consolidated statements of income  and the impairment testing performed in subsequent periods 
goodwill goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  was million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill 
instead  it is subject to at least an annual test for impairment  or whenever indicators of impairment exist  based on a discounted cash flow model 
an impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of the reporting unit 
these estimates include assumptions about future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  capital investments  appropriate discount rates  and other variables that can significantly affect the value of the reporting unit 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over a long term horizon 
we update these assumptions and cash flow estimates at least annually 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of the reporting units included in our segments 
if actual results differ from our estimates  future tests may indicate an impairment of goodwill 
this would result in a non cash charge  adversely affecting our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes property  equipment  and capitalized software of million and intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our property  equipment  capitalized software  and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events or changes may include a deterioration in the business climate for a specific product or service 
if the total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset  we may need to record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of future cash flows and the estimated useful lives associated with these assets are critical to the assessment of recoverability and fair values 
they are susceptible to change from period to period because of the requirement to make assumptions about future cash flows generated over extended periods of time 
changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment  which would result in a reduction to the carrying value and could adversely affect our operating results in the related period 
stock based compensation we include stock based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories 
since  we have mainly granted restricted stock units to employees 
in years prior to  the stock based compensation expense reflected stock option grants 
we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  as of january  under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award s vesting period 
we measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day prior to grant 
for stock options  we measured the fair value on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
we estimate expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
we ultimately adjust this forfeiture assumption to the actual forfeiture rate 
therefore  changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period 
rather  different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period 
because our largest annual equity grants typically have vesting dates in the second quarter of the year  we adjust the stock based compensation expense at that time to reflect those awards that ultimately vested 
in addition  we update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested 
in  we recorded approximately million of additional stock based compensation expense related to these changes in estimates 
in  we recorded additional stock based compensation expense of million related to these changes in estimates 
we believe that the estimates related to stock based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our us and us operations  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions 
tax law requires us to include items in our tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in our consolidated income statement 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  are permanent 
other differences  such as depreciation expense  reverse over time 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units also create a difference between our cash tax rate and the effective tax rate in our consolidated income statement 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of million and deferred tax liabilities of million 
these deferred tax assets include million of deferred tax assets related to million of nols of our non us operations 
because of the historical operating losses of certain of the non us operations that generated these nols  we have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately million of the nols  reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the nols will not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider both positive and negative evidence  including tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income  and recent financial performance 
if we determine a lesser allowance is required at some point in the future  we would record a reduction to our tax expense and valuation allowance 
these adjustments would be made in the same period we determined the change in the valuation allowance was needed 
this would cause our income tax expense  effective tax rate  and net income to fluctuate 
we assess uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we use judgment to identify  recognize  and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize liabilities to represent our potential future obligations to taxing authorities for the benefits taken in our tax returns 
we adjust these liabilities  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
we use judgment to classify unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
we generally classify liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits as noncurrent liabilities 
it typically takes several years between our initial tax return filing and the final resolution of any uncertain tax positions with the tax authority 
we recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations  which we describe in notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
these legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties  and government actions 
assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment 
if actual results differ from our assessments  our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows would be impacted 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
this guidance is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas no 
r  business combinations  when the underlying arrangement includes renewal or extension of terms that would require substantial costs or result in a material modification to the asset upon renewal or extension 
companies estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must now consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements or  in the absence of historical experience  must consider assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension as adjusted for sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates  market prices  or adverse security selection 
our investment portfolio is mainly invested in high quality fixed income securities 
we do not have any direct exposure to sub prime mortgages 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  and investments balance was million 
based on our estimates  a basis point change in interest rates would have increased or decreased the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately million 
as our non us revenue increases as a percentage of our consolidated revenue  fluctuations in foreign currencies present a greater potential risk 
to date  we have not engaged in currency hedging  and we do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk 
our results could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the us dollar 
in addition  because we use the local currency of our subsidiaries as the functional currency  we are affected by the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars
