this facility is owned by a joint venture company  leshan phoenix semiconductor company limited leshan  of which we own a majority of the outstanding equity interests 
our investment in leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements 
our joint venture partner  leshan radio company ltd  is formerly a state owned enterprise 
pursuant to the joint venture agreement  requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture 
each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder  provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment 
we committed to purchase of leshan s production capacity in  in and in and are currently committed to purchase approximately of leshan s expected production capacity in in  we incurred million in underutilization charges 
in and  we did not incur any underutilization charges 
as part of our manufacturing agreements with leshan  we supply die used in the production process 

table of contents the leshan facility is one of our lowest cost manufacturing operations  and we anticipate that any future expansion of our manufacturing capacity would involve this facility 
in june  we obtained approval from the chinese government for the leshan joint venture to invest up to million in semiconductor operations  which is in addition to the million originally approved 
in  we committed to make capital contributions of approximately million to this joint venture by  subject to market conditions 
we have the ability to time these expenditures at our discretion to meet market demand 
in  we acquired an additional interest in our investment in leshan for million  for which the incremental interest in the underlying net tangible and identifiable intangible assets had an estimated fair value of million resulting in million of goodwill 
we also use third party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities  primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods 
our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts 
in some cases  longer term commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship 
these contract manufacturers  including ait  ase  kec  magnachip  phenitec  amkor and psi  accounted for approximately  and of our manufacturing costs in  and  respectively 
raw materials our manufacturing processes use many raw materials  including silicon wafers  gold  copper lead frames  mold compound  ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases 
we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a just in time basis  and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our table showing commitments  contingencies and indemnities in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this report 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available  shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 
sales  marketing and distribution as of december   our global sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately professionals operating out of approximately offices which serve customers in countries 
we support our customers through logistics organizations and just in time warehouses 
global and regional distribution channels further support our customers needs for quick response and service 
we offer efficient  cost effective internet based applications support from our laboratories in the czech republic  china and the united states 
through on line connectivity  applications developed in one region of the world are now instantaneously available to all other regions 
we continue to monitor our freight and logistical support operations for potential cost savings 
patents  trademarks  copyrights and other intellectual property rights we market our products under our registered trademark on semiconductor and our on logo 
we own rights to a number of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets and other intellectual property directly related to and important to our business 
in connection with our recapitalization  motorola assigned  licensed or sublicensed to us  as the case may be  certain intellectual property to support and continue the operation of our business 
as of january   we had approximately us and foreign patents and approximately  patent applications pending worldwide 
our patents have expiration dates ranging from to none of our patents that expire in the near future materially affect our business 
additionally  we have rights to more than registered and common law trademarks 
our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our intellectual property rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents  copyrights and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate 

table of contents as part of the recapitalization  motorola assigned to us approximately us patents and patent applications  approximately foreign patents and patent applications  rights to over trademarks not including the motorola name previously used in connection with our products  rights in know how relating to at least semiconductor fabrication processes and rights in specified copyrightable materials 
in addition  motorola licensed on a nonexclusive  royalty free basis other patent  trademark  copyright and know how rights used in connection with our then existing products and products contemplated in our long range plans 
we have perpetual  royalty free  worldwide rights under motorola s patent portfolio and other intellectual property  existing as of the date of our recapitalization or created in the five years thereafter the five year period existing only with respect to patents  as necessary to manufacture  market and sell our then existing and long range plan product lines 
additionally  motorola provided us with a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from certain infringement claims by third parties who had granted motorola licenses as of the date of our recapitalization  which assisted us in developing our own patent position and licensing program 
through these arrangements  we have the right to use a significant amount of motorola owned technology used in connection with the products we currently offer 
seasonality our revenues have been affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related end markets 
in and  the pattern was one of a seasonally soft first half of the year with a stronger second half of the year as our products have increasingly become more consumer driven 
in  this pattern was interrupted by the global recession  which affected us throughout the year 
we are uncertain if the past pattern will return after global economic conditions settle and return to more predictable patterns 
backlog our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders or customer agreements that are predominately booked as far as weeks in advance of delivery 
generally  prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking 
backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demands from our electronic data interface customers  in each case scheduled to be shipped over the week period following such date 
backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand  pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times 
because we record revenues on a sell through basis  backlog comprised of orders from distributors will not result in revenues until the distributors sell the products ordered 
during  our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between and of actual revenues during such quarter 
as manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases  customers tend to order products further in advance and  as a result  backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase 
we note that due to the macroeconomic environment  current capacity utilization in the industry is decreasing 
as a result  customers are not ordering products as far in advance 
we anticipate that this trend will cause a decrease in backlog at the beginning of such periods 
in the semiconductor industry  backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs 
agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or  as a matter of industry practice  are often not enforced 
therefore  a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable 
for these reasons  the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 
we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with just in time principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products 
however  these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations 

table of contents competition the semiconductor industry  particularly the market for general purpose semiconductor products like ours  is highly competitive 
although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines  we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies  as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches 
because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits  we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits  application specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits  as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 
see part i  item a risk factors trends  risks and uncertainties related to our business located elsewhere in this report 
below we discuss the effects of competition on our five primary operating segments automotive and power regulation the principal methods of competition in this group are new product innovation  technical performance  quality  service and price 
our competitive strengths in this group are our strong technology and design resources  our industry recognition in applications  such as automotive and computing  and our market share 
our significant competitors in this market include fairchild semiconductor  infineon  national semiconductor  st microelectronics and texas instruments 
several of these competitors are larger in scale and size  have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
a competitive challenge in this group is our small market share with certain japanese automotive customers that tend to favor local suppliers for their new product designs 
if we are not identified as a vendor in the product design phase  in most cases it is difficult to convince the manufacturer of the product to substitute our components during the production phase 
computing products the principal methods of competition in this group are technical performance  total cost of solution ownership  quality and assurance of supply 
our architecture for our microprocessor and ddr memory controllers offers a competitive cost of ownership and performance position to compete with incumbent suppliers 
in addition  the breadth of our portfolio in other support functions dc dc converters  over voltage protection fets and analog give us the opportunity to serve multiple requirements and allow customers to control their vendor lists more easily 
our significant competitors in this market include intersil  international rectifier  fairchild semiconductor  and infineon 
several of these competitors are larger in scale and size  have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
digital and consumer products the principal methods of competition in this group are new product innovation  especially in packaging  technical performance  price  quality and assurance of supply 
our competitive strengths in this group are our ability to put rf and emi filters and fets products in ever smaller packages without significantly degrading performance 
our significant competitors in this market include national semiconductor  maxim  fairchild semiconductor  infineon  international rectifier  philips  st microelectronics and vishay 
several of these competitors are larger in scale and size  have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 

table of contents standard products our competitive strength in this area is the breadth of our portfolio  our low cost structure  high quality and our supply chain management which ensures supply to key customers 
the principal methods of competition in this group are new product innovation and constantly introducing new packages and performance improvements on existing products 
of particular importance are our over voltage protection portfolios esd protection  tvs zeners and our clock management and distribution portfolios where we enjoy significant performance advantages over our competition 
our significant competitors in this market include fairchild semiconductor  diodes  nxp  international rectifier  vishay  micrel  idt ics  st microelectronics  texas instruments and semtech 
custom and foundry products group our competitive strengths in this area which add value to our customers include our unique process technologies  our ability to design complex  highly integrated products  our commitment to quality and our commitment to support our customers products throughout their product lives 
our significant competitors in this market include stmicroelectronics  texas instuments  maxim  microchip  linear technology  atmel and ibm 
research and development company sponsored research and development costs in  and were million of revenue  million of revenue and million of revenues  respectively 
our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications 
during  research and development costs increased due to increased expenses associated with on going research and development activities as a result of the acquisitions of amis  the ptc business from adi and catalyst  the development of new process technologies in our gresham  oregon wafer fabrication facility  combined with the effects of foreign currency on wages 
government regulation our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances  the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites  and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination 
our manufacturing facility in phoenix  arizona is located on property that is a superfund site  a property listed on the national priorities list and subject to clean up activities under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act 
motorola is actively involved in the cleanup of on site solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and off site contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the state of arizona 
as part of our recapitalization  motorola has retained responsibility for this contamination and has agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter 
the remaining unused property and buildings are currently being marketed for sale or lease 
manufacturing facilities in slovakia and the czech republic have ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that these facilities were operated by government owned entities 
in each matter  these remediation projects consist primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located on site and off site with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded at each of the respective locations 
the governments of the czech republic and slovakia have agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries  subject to specified limitations  for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination 
based upon the information available  we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material 

table of contents our design center in east greenwich  rhode island is located on property that has localized soil contamination 
when we purchased the east greenwich facility  we entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with the state of rhode island 
this agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property 
based on the information available  we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 
as a result of the acquisition of amis  we are a primary responsible party to an environmental remediation and cleanup at amis s former corporate headquarters in santa clara  california 
costs incurred by amis include implementation of the clean up plan  operations and maintenance of remediation systems  and other project management costs 
however  amis s former parent company  a subsidiary of nippon mining contractually agreed to indemnify amis and us for any obligation relating to environmental remediation and cleanup at this location 
in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 environmental remediation liabilities  we have not offset the receivable from nippon mining s subsidiary against the estimated liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
therefore  a receivable from nippon mining s subsidiary is recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  related to this matter 
we do not believe that the liability and receivable amounts are material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
we do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  and liability for currently known environmental conditions  to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
it is possible  however  that future developments  including changes in laws and regulations  government policies  customer specification  personnel and physical property conditions  including currently undiscovered contamination  could lead to material costs 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees worldwide 
we do not currently have any collective bargaining arrangements with our employees  except for those arrangements  such as workers councils  that are obligatory for all employees or all employers in a particular industry under applicable foreign law 
of the total number of our employees as of december   approximately  were engaged in manufacturing and information services  approximately were engaged in our sales and marketing organization which includes customer service  approximately were engaged in administration and approximately  were engaged in research and development

risk factors trends  risks and uncertainties overview this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements  as that term is defined in section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
all statements  other than statements of historical facts  included or incorporated in this form k could be deemed forward looking statements  particularly statements about our plans  strategies and prospects under the headings management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business 
forward looking statements are often characterized by the use of words such as 
table of contents believes  estimates  expects  projects  may  will  intends  plans  or anticipates  or by discussions of strategy  plans or intentions 
all forward looking statements in this form k are made based on our current expectations and estimates  and involve risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause results or events to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
among these factors are  as discussed more below  our revenues and operating performance  poor economic conditions and markets including the current credit and financial conditions  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  changes in demand for our products  changes in inventories at our customers and distributors  technological and product development risks  availability of raw materials  competitors actions  pricing and gross margin pressures  loss of key customers  order cancellations or reduced bookings  changes in manufacturing yields  control of costs and expenses  significant litigation  risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions  including the completed merger transaction with amis and catalyst risks associated with our substantial leverage and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements  risks associated with our international operations  the threat or occurrence of international armed conflict and terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally  risks and costs associated with regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards including pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and risks involving environmental or other governmental regulation

we assume no obligation to update such information 
you should carefully consider the trends  risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this form k and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission before making any investment decision with respect to our securities 
if any of the following trends  risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected  the trading prices of our securities could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
trends  risks and uncertainties related to our business if deterioration of the economy continues  this could cause additional financial and operational declines  which could lead to unanticipated reductions in our earnings and could result in future goodwill impairments 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our acquisitions of amis  cherry semiconductor corporation cherry and the ptc business 
as of december   the remaining total goodwill for the company amounted to million 
factors we consider important that could trigger a subsequent impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if current economic conditions worsen causing decreased revenues and or increased costs  we may have further material goodwill impairments 
we have experienced declines in revenues and have incurred operating losses  and we may experience additional declines in revenues and incur additional operating losses in the future 
at times our historical financial results have been subject to substantial fluctuations and during those times we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses 
although  recently  we have experienced some strength in our results over the course of the past couple fiscal years  reduced end user demand  price declines  excess inventory  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business  and we are currently experiencing declines in revenue and incurring operating losses 
in order to remain profitable  we must continue to successfully implement our business plan  including our cost reduction initiatives 
we also currently face an environment of declining revenues  uncertain demand and pricing pressure in the markets our products address 
we cannot assure you that  we will be able to in the future turn our recent operating loss into operating income 

table of contents we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry  which is subject to significant downturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
the industry has experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the end user products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
in some ways  we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience such downturns in the future 
we can not accurately predict the timing of the current and future downturns in the semiconductor industry and how severe and prolonged these downturns might be 
future downturns in the semiconductor industry  or any failure of the industry to fully recover from downturns  could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
current economic conditions  including those related to the credit markets  may adversely affect our industry  business and results of operations 
the united states and global economy is currently undergoing a period of slowdown and unprecedented volatility  which some observers view as a recession  and the future economic environment may continue to be less favorable for the foreseeable future 
this slowdown has and could further lead to reduced consumer and commercial spending in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with  or in anticipation of  declines in general economic conditions 
reduced spending may drive us and our competitors to reduce product pricing  which would have a negative impact on gross profit 
a continued softening in the economy may adversely and materially affect our industry  business and results of operations and we can not accurately predict how severe and prolonged any downturn might be 
moreover  reduced revenues as a result of a softening of the economy may also reduce our working capital and interfere with our short term and long term strategies 
furthermore  the united states and global credit markets are currently experiencing an unprecedented contraction 
as a result of the tightening credit markets  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails  we may not be able to find a replacement  which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under our credit facilities 
in addition  if the current pressures on credit continue or worsen  we may not be able to refinance  if necessary  our outstanding debt when due  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures for the immediate future  if our operating results falter and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate  or if interest rates increase significantly  we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the ongoing global financial and economic crisis affecting the financial and other markets could impact our business in a number of other ways  including uncertainty about current and future economic conditions may cause our customers and consumers in general to defer purchases 
the inability of customers to obtain sufficient credit to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us could adversely impact our financial results 
our ability to adequately service our customers depends on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality materials  parts and components from our suppliers 
if certain key suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent as a result of the financial crisis  it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and adversely impact our financial results 
in addition  credit constraints at key suppliers could result in acceleration of payment due from us which might adversely affect our cash flow 
in light of existing economic conditions  certain of our customers may need us to extend additional credit commitments and a continuation of the current credit crisis could require us to make difficult decisions between increasing our level of customer financing or potentially losing sales to these customers 

table of contents the integration of catalyst and amis into our business could result in adverse events and the anticipated benefits of those mergers may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 
the integration of these two companies that have previously operated independently with principal offices in two distinct locations requires significant coordination internally and with third parties 
in response to these mergers  our existing or prospective customers may delay or defer their purchasing or other decisions as we integrate catalyst and amis into our business  or they may seek to change their existing business relationships 
in addition  as a result of the mergers  current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us  and we could lose key employees as a result 
in addition to retention  these uncertainties may also impair our ability to recruit or motivate key personnel 
the integration of catalyst and amis will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management 
the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships 
we estimate material pre tax savings in may be achieved through the integration of catalyst and amis into our business and rationalization of a combined infrastructure 
as with any estimate  it is possible that the estimates of the potential cost savings could turn out to be incorrect 
moreover  even if we were able to integrate both business operations successfully  there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies  cost savings  innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time 
we may experience difficulties in operating the gresham manufacturing facility  including the inability to utilize this additional capacity in a cost efficient manner and to successfully develop new products which can be manufactured in this facility 
on may   we acquired the gresham  oregon wafer fabrication facility and hired substantially all of the manufacturing and engineering employees working at the gresham facility 
our ability to achieve the benefits we anticipated from the acquisition of the gresham manufacturing facility depend in large part upon whether we are able to operate this facility in an efficient and cost effective manner 
if we are unable to operate this facility successfully  we may be unable to realize the cost savings  revenue growth  gross margin improvement  earnings growth and other anticipated benefits we expected to achieve as a result of the acquisition and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in connection with the acquisition of the gresham manufacturing facility  we entered into a supply contract with lsi  the previous owner of the facility  which is due to expire on may  at the end of the second quarter of  lsi will no longer have any obligation to purchase a minimum commitment under this supply contract  and their purchases may decrease significantly 
thereafter  our ability to generate operating profits in the gresham manufacturing facility will likely depend upon our successful development of new products that can be produced using the technology of the gresham manufacturing facility  as well as our ability to transfer existing products to the gresham manufacturing facility 
failure to successfully develop or integrate new products into the gresham manufacturing facility or to successfully market those new products could result in a loss of market share in the industry or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets  and ultimately could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results 
our gross profit is dependent on a number of factors  including our level of capacity utilization 
semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment  leading to high fixed costs  including depreciation expense 
if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits 
as a percentage of total revenues  gross profit was for  compared to for  and for gross profit declined in primarily due to the sale of inventory that was written up to fair value in connection with the acquisitions of adi  amis and catalyst  as well as the decrease in average selling prices  partially offset by cost reduction activities 
in and  the gross profit percentage declined 
table of contents because the decrease in average selling prices was not fully offset by cost reduction activities 
increased competition and other factors  including current economic factors  may lead to price erosion  lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 
the failure to implement  as well as the completion and impact of  our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions could adversely affect our business 
from time to time  we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives in response to  among other things  significant downturns in our industry 
these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions  transitioning higher cost external supply to internal manufacturing  working with our material suppliers to further lower costs  personnel reductions  reductions in employee compensation  temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead 
in the past  we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives 
these costs were primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments as well as gains on the sale of assets and insurance recoveries 
on january   we announced that we intended to accelerate our stand alone cost reduction programs including a continued focus on the consolidation of our manufacturing operations 
most recently  in january  we announced that we were taking additional cost reduction measures 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began taking initial actions to reduce overall spending levels 
the actions included the reduction of planned capital expenditures to to million from normalized yearly levels of approximately to million  temporary site shutdowns during the fourth quarter of  a hiring freeze  the elimination of second half of bonus payments and strict controls over all discretionary spending 
we also planned a series of additional permanent and temporary actions to reduce its overall cost structure 
these planned actions include recently announced factory closure planned for the middle of  factory closures planned for the end of will be brought forward to the middle of  factory shutdowns for to weeks in the first and second quarter of three weeks of unpaid time off for senior executives in both the first and second quarter of  two weeks of unpaid time off or a day work week based upon local legal requirements for other employees in both the first and second quarter of  no annual merit increases  no bonus payments expected to be paid in  and a reduction in worldwide personnel of approximately  which equates to a reduction of approximately percent of total payroll expenses 
the combination of these and other actions we are taking is expected to reduce total fixed costs by approximately to million a quarter  of which approximately to million will be from temporary actions 
these actions are expected to reduce operating expenses by approximately million from the third quarter of run rates and exclude the operating expense impact associated with the catalyst semiconductor acquisition which closed in the fourth quarter of once completed  these actions are expected to reduce the revenues required for cash breakeven to approximately million a quarter 
to execute these cost reduction actions  we anticipate we will use approximately to million of cash over the next quarters and incur restructuring and other charges  a portion of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of we cannot assure you that these cost reduction initiatives will be successfully implemented  or will sufficiently help in returning to profitability 
because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business  the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated 
even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings  there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that could adversely impact our profitability and business  including unintended employee attrition 

table of contents if we are unable to implement our business strategy  our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 
our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes  without limitation  plans to continue to aggressively manage  maintain and refine our product portfolio  continue to develop leading edge customer support services  further expand our just in time delivery capabilities  increase our die manufacturing capacity in a cost effective manner  further reduce the number of our product platforms and process flows  rationalize our manufacturing operations  relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions  reduce selling and administrative expenses  manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands  actively manage working capital  develop new products in a more efficient manner  and focus on the development of power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management products 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations 
in particular  we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential  increase our volume or revenue  rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 
our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably 
each of these factors depends on our ability  among other things  to finance our operating and product development activities  maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations  relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations  access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a cost effective and timely manner  protect our intellectual property portfolio and attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and finance personnel 
several of these and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy  such as risks associated with international operations  the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities  increased competition  legal developments and general economic conditions  are beyond our control 
in addition  circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 
we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 
the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products 
we are committed to maintaining spending on new product development in order to stay competitive in our markets 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 
uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of  and payment for  our products could adversely affect our business 
our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers 
generally  our customers may cancel orders days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty 
we routinely purchase inventory based on customers estimates of demand for their products  which is difficult to predict 
this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers  or both  as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason 
furthermore  short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity 
the cancellation or deferral of product orders  the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 

table of contents an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us  and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 
rapidly changing technologies and industry standards  along with frequent new product introductions  characterize the industries that are currently the primary end users of semiconductors 
as these industries evolve and introduce new products  our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and cost effective manner by designing  developing  manufacturing  marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and end users and adapt to such changes in a timely and cost effective manner 
nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or end users could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 
the semiconductor industry  particularly the market for semiconductor components  is highly competitive 
as a result of the recent economic downturn  competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified  as manufacturers of semiconductor components have offered reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels 
although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines  we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches 
in addition  companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 
the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness 
many of our competitors  particularly larger competitors resulting from consolidations  may have certain advantages over us  including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products  longer independent operating histories  presence in key markets  patent protection  and greater name recognition 
because our components are often building block semiconductors that  in some cases  are integrated into more complex integrated circuits  we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits  application specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits  as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 
we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price  quality  technical performance  product features  product system compatibility  customized design  strategic relationships with customers  new product innovation  availability  delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support 
gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used  such as personal computers  industrial and telecommunications equipment  consumer electronics and automotive goods 
our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control  including industry and general economic trends 
unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency  our future profitability could be adversely affected 
manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment 
we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields 
our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 

table of contents from time to time  we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities  transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  transferring production to other facilities  upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies  any of which could result in a loss of future revenues 
our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity  if revenues do not increase proportionately 
we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing and information technology and equipment to remain competitive  the failure  inadequacy or delayed implementation of which could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 
semiconductor manufacturing has historically required a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive  as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller  more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices 
we maintain certain of our own manufacturing  assembly and test facilities  which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume 
we also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency 
any such implementation  however  can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation  any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or  in some instances  to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned 
in the case of abandonment  we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet 
on january   in connection with several cost reduction measures  we announced the reduction of planned capital expenditures to to million from normalized yearly levels of approximately to million 
this reduction may affect our ability to remain competitive or maintain efficiency and productivity 
ultimately  we may be forced to increase our future capital expenditures to meet our operational needs in  among other areas  manufacturing  information technology and equipment 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in the areas discussed above or other areas we have not identified 
if we were to lose one of our large customers our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
product sales to our ten largest customers have traditionally accounted for a significant amount of our business 
many of our customers operate in cyclical industries  and  in the past  we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered 
generally  our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products 
we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services  or increases in the prices of such goods or services  could adversely affect our operations and productivity 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of our raw materials increase significantly or their quality deteriorates 
our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials  including polysilicon  silicon wafers  gold  copper lead frames  mold compound  ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases 
generally  our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations  and we obtain our raw 
table of contents materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a just in time basis 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate  shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 
in addition  for some of our products  we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials 
the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited 
we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules 
disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 
we also use third party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities  primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods 
our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts  and in some cases require longer term commitments in the early stages of the relationship 
our operations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated  the cost of such services increased significantly  the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect 
we may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties  including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses  incurring additional debt  assuming contingent liabilities or diluting our existing stockholders 
in order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities  we have made  and may continue to make  strategic acquisitions  mergers and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties 
successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require  among other things  efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
among other concerns  successful acquisitions and alliances are subject to the following risks and uncertainties the difficulty of integrating  aligning and coordinating organization  which will likely be geographically separated and involve separate technologies and corporate cultures  the challenges in achieving strategic objectives  cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions  the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses  the risk of diverting the attention of senior management and other key employees from our day to day operations and key research and development  marketing or sales efforts  the risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience  risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems  difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses  and future impairments of goodwill of an acquired business 
in addition  key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in connection with a transaction in the form of change in control agreements  acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equity based compensation rights 
in addition  we may also issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances  which could be dilutive to existing stockholders 
we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances  which could harm our operating results 

table of contents our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 
a significant amount of our total revenue is derived from the americas  the asia pacific region and europe including the middle east  respectively 
similarly  we maintain significant operations in these regions 
in addition  we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asia pacific region 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets 
risks inherent in doing business on an international level include  among others  the following economic and political instability including as a result of the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  transportation delays  power supply shortages and shutdowns  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  exposure to foreign labor laws and other employment and labor issues  currency convertibility and repatriation  taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel  and other risks relating to the administration of or changes in  or new interpretations of  the laws  regulations and policies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
our activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates  hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange 
while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 
if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 
our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and financial personnel 
the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive 
for example  analog component designers are difficult to attract and retain  and the failure to attract and retain analog component designers could compromise our ability to keep pace with our competitors in the market for analog components 
in addition  in january  we announced certain cost reductions that included the freezing of salaries and elimination of bonuses  mandatory unpaid time off  factory shutdowns and reduction in personnel 
all of the measures could negatively affect morale and lead to unintended employee attrition at all levels of our organization 
moreover  we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel 
as employee incentives  we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time 
we have also issued restricted stock units with time based vesting and performance based awards 
our stock price at times has declined substantially  reducing the effectiveness of certain of these incentives 
loss of the services of  or failure to effectively recruit  qualified personnel  including senior managers and design engineers  could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business 
some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties  and litigation could arise in the future 
if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use  our business could be adversely affected 
we rely on patents  trade secrets  trademarks  mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies 
some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications and we cannot assure you that any of the substantial number of us and foreign patents and pending patent applications that we employ in our business  including those that motorola assigned  licensed or sublicensed to us in connection with our recapitalization  will not lapse or be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  abandoned or licensed to others  the license rights granted by motorola in connection with our recapitalization will provide competitive advantages to us  the license rights granted by adi in connection with the ptc business will provide competitive advantage to us  the license rights granted by lsi in connection with our acquisition of its gresham  oregon semiconductor manufacturing facility will provide competitive advantage to us  any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought  any of the trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  know how or mask works that motorola has assigned  licensed or sublicensed to us in connection with our recapitalization will not lapse or be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  abandoned or licensed to others  or any of our pending or future trademark  copyright  or mask work applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought 
in addition  our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies  duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable  limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 
also  we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing third party patents or other intellectual property rights 
if necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies 
litigation could cause us to incur significant expense  by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor 
in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation  we may be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use  sale or importation of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies  discontinue the use of processes  or obtain licenses to the infringing technologies 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms 
any such development  acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 

table of contents we will also seek to protect our proprietary technologies  including technologies that may not be patented or patentable  in part by confidentiality agreements and  if applicable  inventors rights agreements with our collaborators  advisors  employees and consultants 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research 
we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights  which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 
our ability to enforce our patents  copyrights  software licenses and other intellectual property is subject to general litigation risks  as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries 
when we seek to enforce our rights  we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid  is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim 
in addition  our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us  which may adversely impact our business 
an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or  in cases for which injunctive relief is sought  an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products  which could in turn negatively affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of these claims asserted by other parties with respect to their alleged intellectual property rights 
we are subject to litigation risks  including securities class action litigation  which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 
all industries  including the semiconductor industry  are subject to legal claims  with and without merit  including securities class action litigation that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
we are involved in a variety of legal matters  most of which we consider routine matters that arise in the normal course of business 
these routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers  employment and labor  and intellectual property 
we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  defense and settlement costs can be substantial  even with respect to claims that have no merit 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process  the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as mentioned above  from time to time  we have been  or may in the future be  involved in securities litigation 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any securities litigation matter in which we are party 
these types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace 
because the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile  we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future 
see part i  item  legal proceedings of this report for more information on our legal proceedings  including our pending securities class action litigation 
we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards  including section of the sarbanes oxley act 
like most publicly traded companies  we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires management s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public 
table of contents accounting firm 
we have not been able to ascertain the impact that the integrations of amis and catalyst will have in the future on our ability to maintain internal control over financial reporting 
amis reported in its quarterly report on form q for the fiscal quarter ended september  that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of september  as a result of a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting 
see amis s quarterly report on form q for the fiscal quarter ended september  for more information on this material weakness 
we have not assessed the impact that amis s material weakness will have on our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting  and will not be able to adequately do so until after the integration is completed  which is expected to occur in the first quarter of additionally  we have not assessed the impact that catalyst will have on our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting  and will not be able to adequately to do so until the second half of there can be no assurance that our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company s internal control over financial reporting in the future 
if internal controls over financial reporting are materially deficient  we may experience a loss of public confidence  which could have a material adverse effect on its business and stock price 
see part ii  item a controls and procedures of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 
environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air  water and ground 
our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health  which  among other things  regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances 
motorola has agreed to indemnify us for environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola s ownership  occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our recapitalization 
we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances 
however  we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs 
in addition  the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities related to events or activities occurring after our recapitalization 
based on information currently available to us  we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  and any liability for currently known environmental conditions  will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
however  we cannot predict changes in environmental or health and safety laws or regulations  the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced  administered or interpreted  our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities  or the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims  including the cost of clean up of currently unknown environmental conditions 
warranty claims  product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury or property damage or both 
in particular  through our new amis subsidiary  we are subject to warranty and 
table of contents product liability claims relating to the medical market that are disproportional to the revenue we receive from our customers who incorporate our products into their goods or products 
in addition  if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in their recall 
as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design  original equipment manufacturers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls 
a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves  or a requirement that we participate in a product recall  would have adverse effects that could be material on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
trends  risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
we are highly leveraged and have substantial debt service obligations 
in addition  we may incur additional debt in the future  subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors  including our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our debt  which reduces the funds available to us for our operations  some of our debt is and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates  our debt agreements contain  and any agreements to refinance our debt likely will contain  financial and restrictive covenants  and our failure to comply with them may result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us  our level of indebtedness will increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions  as our long term debt ages  we may need to reclassify or repay such debt or seek additional financing see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report under commercial commitments  contractual obligations and indemnities of the liquidity and capital resources section  our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the semiconductor industry  and our substantial leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage vis vis our competitors who have less leverage relative to their overall capital structures 
we may incur more debt and may require additional capital in the future to service this new debt  which could exacerbate the risks described above 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness currently limit us along with our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness 
while we expect to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents for the next months  if we incur additional debt  the related risks that we now face could intensify and it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to service this new debt and to fund our future activities 
moreover  some of the debt we may incur may be secured by the same collateral securing certain of our existing indebtedness 
ultimately  we may not be able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms  or at all  and we may need to curtail our operations significantly  reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development  or be forced to obtain funds through arrangements that management did not anticipate  including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies or other activities that may impair our ability to remain competitive 

table of contents the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 
our debt agreements contain  and any future debt agreements may include  a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  including guarantees  incur liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  make investments  loans or advances  make some acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  make capital expenditures  pay dividends  redeem capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments  pay dividends from semiconductor components industries  llc to on semiconductor corporation  engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions  enter into new lines of business  issue some types of preferred stock  and enter into transactions with our affiliates 
any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 
our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness  including as a result of events beyond our control  could result in an event of default  that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 
if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately 
we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments  either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or  if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control  that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities 
further  if we are unable to repay  refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt  the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness 
in addition  any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling additional assets  reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital 
the terms of our financing agreements contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible  that any assets could be sold  or  if sold  of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales  or that additional financing could be obtained on 
table of contents acceptable terms  if at all  or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms  would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
trends  risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability  and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations 
a large portion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter 
factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include the timing and size of orders from our customers  including cancellations and reschedulings  the timing of introduction of new products  the gain or loss of significant customers  including as a result of industry consolidation  seasonality in some of our target markets  changes in the mix of products we sell  changes in demand by the end users of our customers products  market acceptance of our current and future products  variability of our customers product life cycles  changes in manufacturing yields or other factors affecting the cost of goods sold  such as the cost and availability of raw materials and the extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity  changes in the prices of our products  which can be affected by the level of our customers and end users demand  technological change  product obsolescence  competition or other factors  cancellations  changes or delays of deliveries to us by our third party manufacturers  including as a result of the availability of manufacturing capacity and the proposed terms of manufacturing arrangements  our liquidity and access to capital  and our research and development activities and the funding thereof 
our stock price may be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 
the stock markets in general  and the markets for high technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors  some of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance  changes in market valuations of similar companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  capital commitments  new products or product enhancements  
table of contents loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions  and additions or departures of key personnel 
the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has had a significant variance and we can not accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 
provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company  which could decrease the value of our stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions create a board of directors with staggered terms  permit only our board of directors or the chairman of our board of directors to call special meetings of stockholders  establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock  which is preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and that our board of directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval  and require the approval by holders of at least of our outstanding common stock to amend any of these provisions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws 
although we believe these provisions make a higher third party bid more likely by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders

our joint venture in leshan  china also owns manufacturing  warehouse  laboratory  office and unused space 
in december  we announced our decision to phase out manufacturing operations at our facility in east greenwich  rhode island 
we completed this closure during the fourth quarter of we transferred the production from this facility to our lower cost manufacturing facilities 
we completed the sale of the manufacturing facility in the fourth quarter of we still own and occupy an approximately  square foot design center in east greenwich  rhode island

this site is acres and includes  square feet of clean room 
as part of our recapitalization  motorola conveyed to us the surface rights to a portion of the land located at our phoenix facility  excluding the subsurface rights  and conveyed buildings located at the phoenix facility 
these buildings do not include any treatment facilities relating to motorola s environmental clean up operations at the phoenix facility 
we executed a declaration of covenants  easements and restrictions with motorola providing access easements for the parties and granting us options to purchase or to lease the subsurface rights of the land

item legal proceedings we currently are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
based on information currently available  management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters  including the matters described or referred to in the next paragraphs will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation  should the outcome of these actions be unfavorable  our business  consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
securities class action litigation during the period july  through july   we were named as a defendant in three shareholder class action lawsuits that were filed in federal court in new york city against us and certain of our former officers  current and former directors and the underwriters for our initial public offering 
the lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and have been docketed in the us district court for the southern district of new york as abrams v 
on semiconductor corp  et al  ca no cv  breuer v 
on semiconductor corp  et al  ca no 
cv  and cohen v 
on semiconductor corp  et al  ca no 
cv district court 
on april   the plaintiffs filed a single consolidated amended complaint that supersedes the individual complaints originally filed 
the amended complaint alleges  among other things  that the underwriters of our initial public offering improperly required their customers to pay the underwriters excessive commissions and to agree to buy additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket as conditions of receiving shares in our initial public offering 
the amended complaint further alleges that these supposed practices of the underwriters should have been disclosed in our initial public offering prospectus and registration statement 
the amended complaint alleges violations of both the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages 
we understand that various other plaintiffs have filed substantially similar class action cases against approximately other publicly traded 
table of contents companies and their public offering underwriters in new york city  which have all been transferred  along with the case against us  to a single federal district court judge for purposes of coordinated case management 
we believe that the claims against us are without merit and have defended  and intend to continue to defend  the litigation vigorously 
the litigation process is inherently uncertain  however  and we cannot guarantee that the outcome of these claims will be favorable for us 
on july   together with the other issuer defendants  we filed a collective motion to dismiss the consolidated  amended complaints against the issuers on various legal grounds common to all or most of the issuer defendants 
the underwriters also filed separate motions to dismiss the claims against them 
in addition  the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of our individual former officers and current and former directors who were named as defendants in our litigation  and they are no longer parties to the litigation 
on february   the district court issued its ruling on the motions to dismiss filed by the underwriter and issuer defendants 
in that ruling the district court granted in part and denied in part those motions 
as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws  the district court dismissed all of these claims with prejudice  and refused to allow plaintiffs the opportunity to re plead these claims 
as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws  which do not require that intent to defraud be pleaded  the district court denied the motion to dismiss these claims as to us and as to substantially all of the other issuer defendants as well 
the district court also denied the underwriter defendants motion to dismiss in all respects 
in june  upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors  we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation 
had it been approved by the district court  this proposed settlement would have resulted in the dismissal  with prejudice  of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elected to participate in the proposed settlement  together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants 
this proposed issuer settlement was conditioned on  among other things  a ruling by the district court that the claims against us and against the other issuers who had agreed to the settlement would be certified for class action treatment for purposes of the proposed settlement  such that all investors included in the proposed classes in these cases would be bound by the terms of the settlement unless an investor opted to be excluded from the settlement in a timely and appropriate fashion 
on december   the us court of appeals for the second circuit court of appeals issued a decision in in re initial public offering securities litigation that six purported class action lawsuits containing allegations substantially similar to those asserted against us could not be certified as class actions due  in part  to the court of appeals determination that individual issues of reliance and knowledge would predominate over issues common to the proposed classes 
on january   the plaintiffs filed a petition seeking rehearing en banc of this ruling 
on april   the court of appeals denied the plaintiffs petition for rehearing of the court of appeals december  ruling 
the court of appeals  however  noted that the plaintiffs remained free to ask the district court to certify classes different from the ones originally proposed which might meet the standards for class certification that the court of appeals articulated in its december  decision 
in light of the court of appeals december  decision regarding certification of the plaintiffs claims  the district court entered an order on june  terminating the proposed settlement between the plaintiffs and the issuers  including us 
on august   the plaintiffs filed amended complaints in the six focus cases 
the issuer defendants and the underwriter defendants separately moved to dismiss the claims against them in the amended complaints in the six focus cases 
on march   the district court issued an order in which it denied in substantial part the motions to dismiss the amended complaints in the six focus cases 
in february  an agreement in principle to settle the litigation in its entirety was reached  which agreement will be subject to negotiation  filing with the district court of definitive settlement documents  and final approval by the district court 
while we can make no assurances or guarantees as to the outcome of these 
table of contents proceedings  we believe that the final result of this action will have no material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
intellectual property matters we face risk to exposure from claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
in the ordinary course of business  we receive letters asserting that our products or components breach another party s rights 
these threats may seek that we make royalty payments  that we stop use of such rights  or other remedies 
we were in binding arbitration on one such claim under an existing license agreement 
the arbitration hearing occurred late last year and the panel issued an interim reasoned award on march  containing a final decision and ruling that none of our accused products infringed the asserted patent 
per the terms of the license agreement  this decision is binding and non appealable 
however  on april   the other party filed a motion with the panel to reconsider its decision on the merits  which we opposed as being impermissible and procedurally improper 
on may   the panel issued its decision and order denying the other party s motion to reconsider the interim reasoned award 
on may   we filed a motion to recover our costs  arbitrators fees  and attorneys fees 
on july   the panel issued a decision in our favor and ordered the other party to pay us substantially all of our costs and fees 
on june   the other party filed petitions to vacate in part the panel s interim reasoned award 
one petition was filed in arizona state court and the other petition was filed in arizona federal district court 
on august   we filed a counter petition in state court to confirm the panel s july  ruling 
on august   the other party filed an amended petition in state court to stay all proceedings there pending the federal court s decision on jurisdiction  which petition was subsequently granted on october  we believe both petitions filed by the other party are without merit 
on january   we entered into a settlement agreement with the other party who agreed to pay us the costs and fees awarded by the panel 
the parties filed stipulations to dismiss in both the state and federal courts  which stipulations to dismiss were granted with prejudice by the state court on february  and by the federal court on february  bringing this matter to a close 
on april   lsi logic corporation lsi and agere systems inc agere which was acquired by lsi in filed a new patent infringement action with the us international trade commission itc naming semiconductor companies including us 
lsi and agere also filed a parallel patent infringement lawsuit against the same companies in the federal district court in the eastern district of texas 
lsi and agere are seeking an injunction and damages in an unspecified amount relating to such alleged infringement 
the patent relates to semiconductor wafer processing 
we believe that we are already licensed to the asserted patent through pre existing patent license agreements with lsi and agere  and that these licenses cover all of our relevant wafer operations 
lsi and agere have agreed with our assertion that we are already licensed and we are completing discussions on a settlement agreement which would dismiss us from both the itc action and the lawsuit 
prior to the acquisition of amis by us on march   on july   amis was served with an amended complaint filed against its operating company  ami semiconductor  inc  and its belgian subsidiary  ami semiconductor belgium bvba  by powerdsine  inc  and powerdsine  ltd  subsidiaries of microsemi corporation powerdsine  in the united states district court for the southern district of new york related to amis s recently announced power over ethernet poe power sourcing equipment pse application specific integrated circuit products custom designed for broadcom corporation 
the complaint alleged that amis breached the terms of a nondisclosure agreement between the parties and that amis interfered with a powerdsine  ltd 
employment contract with a former employee who left powerdsine and came to work for amis 
this second claim was later dismissed by powerdsine on august  in the complaint  powerdsine seeks injunctive relief and damages in excess of million 
amis has denied powerdsine s claims and has filed counterclaims against powerdsine and microsemi for defamation 
in december  the district court held on summary judgment that powerdsine and microsemi s statements did not constitute defamation under california state law where the statements by microsemi were made 
also in december  the parties participated in a mandatory mediation with a federal magistrate judge for the southern district of new york  but 
table of contents arrived at no settlement 
discovery in the case is complete and the trial began in new york on february  and was scheduled to be completed by february  on february   the district court judge suspended trial until march  to allow for further mediation in an effort to resolve the dispute 
we believe that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
prior to the acquisition of amis by us on march   in january  ricoh company  ltd 
ricoh filed in the us district court for the district of delaware a complaint against amis and other parties alleging infringement of a patent owned by ricoh 
the case has been transferred to the us district court for the northern district of california 
ricoh is seeking an injunction and damages in an unspecified amount relating to such alleged infringement 
the patents relate to certain methodologies for the automated design of custom semiconductors 
the case was scheduled to go to trial in march  however  in december the court issued an order staying the case pending a re examination proceeding filed by synopsys  inc synopsys before the us patent trademark office pto challenging the validity of the patent claims at issue in this case 
since that time  synopsis has filed a total of three re examination petitions with the pto challenging the validity of the claims at issue 
the pto granted all three petitions and consolidated all three re examinations into one proceeding before a single examiner 
in april  the court lifted the stay despite the ongoing reexamination proceedings in the pto which proceedings were subsequently completed in september and the pto issued a final rejection of all claims in the asserted patent over prior art 
ricoh has filed a notice of appeal with pto and has until february  to file its appeal brief 
additionally  in september the court granted defendants request to refile its summary judgment motion on non infringement that had been vacated as moot when the stay was imposed in december a hearing on defendants motion for summary judgment was scheduled for january  but was cancelled by the judge who instead told both parties that he would issue his order without holding a hearing 
we are currently awaiting the judge s order 
we believe that the asserted claims are without merit  and even if meritorious  that we will be indemnified against damages by synopsys  and that resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows

table of contents industry overview worldwide semiconductor industry sales were billion in  an increase of from billion in we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the total market in the areas we provide semiconductor components 
the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our total addressable market since year ended december  worldwide semiconductor industry sales percent change total addressable market sales percent change in billions in billions based on shipment information published by wsts  an industry research firm 
wsts collects this information based on product shipments  which is different from our revenue recognition policy as described in critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition contained elsewhere in this report 
we believe the data provided by wsts is reliable  but we have not independently verified it 
wsts periodically revises its information 
we assume no obligation to update such information 
our total addressable market comprises the following specific wsts product categories a discrete products all discrete semiconductors other than sensors  rf and microwave power transistors modules  rf and microwave diodes  rf and microwave ss transistors  power fet modules  igbt modules  sp logic and optoelectronics  b standard analog products amplifiers  voltage regulators and references  comparators  assp consumer  assp computer  assp automotive and assp industrial and others  c standard logic products general purpose logic and mos general purpose logic only  d sp logic consumer other  computer other peripherals  wired communications  automotive and industrial  e cmos image sensors  and f memory 
although we categorize our products as power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components  wsts uses different product categories 
following the unprecedented semiconductor industry revenue declines of  the semiconductor industry began to show signs of stability in and grew more robust in both and worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew by in  in  and in sales in our total addressable market grew by in  reflecting increases in volume and slowing rates of price declines

sales in our total addressable market grew in  reflecting increases in volume that exceeded the impact of further pure declines 
sales in our total addressable market grew significantly in  reflecting the expanded markets we now serve with the acquisitions of amis and catalyst that exceeded the impact of any pure declines 
the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our total addressable market of approximately during through these projections are not ours and may not be indicative of actual results 
recent results our total revenues for the year ended december  were  million  an increase of percent from  million for the year ended december   the majority of which was due to our acquisition of amis in the first quarter of during  we reported a net loss of million that included a goodwill impairment charge of million 
during  we reported net income of million that included million in restructuring  asset impairments and other benefits 
our gross margin decreased by approximately 
table of contents basis points to in from in the primary reason for the decrease is attributable to the sale of inventory that was written up to fair value in connection with the acquisitions of adi  amis and catalyst  as well as the decreases in average selling prices  partially offset by cost reduction activities in versus outlook based upon product booking trends  backlog levels  manufacturing services revenues and estimated turns levels  we anticipate that total revenues will be approximately million to million in the first quarter of backlog levels at the beginning of the first quarter of were down from backlog levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter of and represent approximately to percent of our anticipated first quarter revenues 
we expect that average selling prices for the first quarter of will be down approximately from the fourth quarter of we expect cash capital expenditures of approximately million to million in the first quarter of and total cash capital expenditures for of approximately million to million 
for the first quarter of  we expect gross profit as a percentage of revenue to be approximately to 
for the first quarter of  we also expect total operating expenses of approximately million to million  which include the amortization of intangible assets  stock compensation expense  restructuring  asset impairments and other charges of approximately million to million 
we anticipate that net interest expense and other expenses will be approximately million for the first quarter of  which includes non cash interest expense of approximately million from the adoption of fasb apb relating to our convertible senior subordinated notes 
we expect cash payments of income taxes to be approximately million 
we also expect stock compensation expense of approximately million to million in the first quarter of our current fully diluted share count is approximately million shares based on recent share prices 
business overview we classify our products broadly as power analog  digital signal processing  mixed signal  advanced logic  memory  data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components 
we design  manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that addresses the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products 
our power management semiconductor components control  convert  protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices 
our custom application specific integrated circuits use analog  digital signal processing  mixed signal and advanced logic capabilities to act as the brain behind many of our automotive  medical  military  aerospace  consumer and industrial customers unique products 
our data management semiconductor components provide high performance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems 
our standard semiconductor components serve as building block components within virtually all electronic devices 
these various products fall into the logic  analog and discrete categories used by wsts 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical 
during a down cycle  unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem  resulting in revenue declines 
in response to such declines  manufacturers have shut down production capacity 
when new applications or other factors have eventually caused demand to strengthen  production volumes have eventually stabilized and then grown again 
as market unit demand have reached levels above capacity production capabilities  shortages have begun to occur  which typically has caused pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers  thus prompting further capacity expansion 
such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand  which has triggered another similar cycle 
during we experienced an increase in revenues over resulting from the acquisitions of amis and catalyst  net of price decreases 
we expect price declines during to be moderate but macroeconomic and competitive factors can quickly change the pricing landscape 

table of contents new product innovation as a result of the success of our research and development initiatives  excluding the introduction of lead free products  we introduced new product families in  of which were generated from the acquisitions of amis and catalyst  and were generated from our existing business operations 
there were new product families in our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications 
with the acquisition of the gresham  oregon wafer fabrication facility  we increased our research and development in deep sub micron power management solutions to further differentiate us from our competition 
as always  it is our practice to regularly re evaluate our research and development spending  to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies regularly 
we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to position us for continued growth 
as a result  we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity logic  analog  memory and discrete products 
we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 
cost savings and restructuring activities we continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and  as a result  we expect to rank  as compared to our primary competitors  among the lowest in terms of cost structure 
during the first quarter of  we announced plans to consolidate manufacturing efforts with the closing of one of our manufacturing facilities at our phoenix  arizona location 
the wafer manufacturing that took place at this facility has been transferred to our off shore low cost manufacturing facilities 
we have exited this facility  although we still own it and have leased it to another company for a period of seven years beginning in the fourth quarter of all employees associated with this facility have been terminated 
also in connection with this activity  during the third quarter of we announced reductions in factory support functions at our phoenix  arizona and gresham  oregon locations  which resulted in the elimination or transfer of positions 
the full cost savings from these actions is reflected in our outlook for the first quarter of during the second quarter of  we began the process of closing our wafer fabrication facilities in piestany  slovakia  which will result in the elimination of approximately positions 
we expect full annual savings from this announcement to be approximately million to million annually  beginning in the second quarter of during the first quarter of  in response to the economic downturn  we announced the following actions to reduce overall spending levels reduction in planned capital expenditures to between million and million compared to normalized levels of between million and million  temporary hiring freeze  the elimination of bonus payments during  three weeks of unpaid time off for senior executives in both the first and second quarters of  two weeks of unpaid time off or day work week based upon local legal requirements for other employees in both the first and second quarters of  and no annual merit increases  a reduction in worldwide personnel of approximately  employees  which equates to an approximate decrease of of total payroll  and  the planned closure of our remaining phoenix  arizona wafer fabrication facility  which is expected to result in the elimination of approximately positions 
the actions we announced during the first quarter of are expected to reduce total fixed costs by approximately million to million a quarter  of which million to million will be from temporary 
table of contents actions 
these actions are expected to reduce operating expenses by approximately million 
the company expects initial benefits from these actions to start in the first quarter of and to increase throughout the year 
the initial benefits have been included in our outlook for the first quarter of our profitability enhancement programs will continue to focus on consolidating manufacturing sites to improve economies of scale  transferring production to lower cost regions  increasing die manufacturing capacity in a cost effective manner by moving production from and to wafers and increasing the number of die per square inch  reducing the number of product platforms and process flows  and focusing production on profitable product families 
debt reduction and financing activities since the recapitalization  we have had relatively high levels of long term debt as compared to our principal competitors 
during and  we engaged in several debt refinancing transactions  which extended a portion of our debt maturities 
since  however  we began undertaking measures to reduce our long term debt and related interest costs 
as a result of these measures  we reduced our total debt from  million as of december  to  million as of december  similarly  we have reduced our annual interest expense from million in to million in also  see liquidity and capital resources and note long term debt of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k

table of contents other operating expense goodwill impairment charges we monitor the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions  by reporting unit  annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our goodwill has been allocated to a total of ten reporting units 
we performed the annual impairment analysis of goodwill at the reporting unit level as of the first day of the fourth quarter by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that based on current market conditions and a decline in our business outlook  primarily due to the macroeconomic environment  million of the carrying amount of our goodwill allocated to six of our reporting units was impaired 
the goodwill allocated to these six reporting units was primarily from our december  acquisition of the ptc business and our march  acquisition of amis 
the remaining four reporting units whose goodwill was not impaired had declines in business outlook  although not significant enough to trigger impairment 
we recognized goodwill impairment charges of million in the custom and foundry products segment  million in the automotive and power regulation segment  million in the digital and consumer products segment and million in the computing products segment for a total charge of million 
the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill was assigned was estimated using the present value of estimated future cash flows

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we enter into various operating leases for buildings and equipment including our mainframe computer system  desk top computers  communications  foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 
in the normal course of business  we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us  as required for transactions such as material purchase commitments  leases or customs guarantees

for our operating leases  we expect to make cash payments and similarly incur expenses totaling million as payments come due 
based on historical experience and information currently available  we believe we will not be required to make any payments under the standby letters of credit or bank guarantee arrangements 
contingencies we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements 
some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to intellectual property infringement  property damage including environmental contamination  personal injury  failure to comply with applicable laws  our negligence or willful misconduct  or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 
we are a party to various agreements with motorola  a former affiliate  which were entered into in connection with our separation from motorola 
pursuant to these agreements  we have agreed to indemnify motorola for losses due to  for example  breach of representations and warranties and covenants  damages arising from assumed liabilities or relating to allocated assets  and for specified environmental matters 
our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount and payment by us is conditioned on motorola making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract  which procedures typically allow us to challenge motorola s claims 
we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury or property damage or both 
in addition  if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in their recall 
depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors  we may agree to provide more favorable indemnity rights to such customers for valid warranty claims 

table of contents in connection with the acquisitions of lsi s gresham  oregon wafer fabrication facility and adi s ptc business  we entered into various agreements with lsi and adi  respectively 
pursuant to certain of these agreements  we agreed to indemnify lsi and adi  respectively for certain things limited in the most instances by time and or monetary amounts 
we and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors  officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements  certificates of incorporation  by laws  articles of association or similar organizational documents  as the case may be 
we maintain directors and officers insurance  which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
in addition to the above  from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisors and also provide indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 
while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification  other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
see part i  item legal proceedings of this report and note commitments and contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for possible contingencies related to legal matters and see part i  item business government regulation of this report for information on certain environmental matters 
sources and uses of cash we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements  including outlays for research and development  to make capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions and investments  to repurchase our stock and other company securities  and to pay debt service including our senior subordinated notes  including principal and interest and capital lease payments 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances 
in the near term  we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand and targeted asset sales 
additionally  as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 
we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include factors that affect our results of operations and cash flows  including changes in demand for our products  competitive pricing pressures  effective management of our manufacturing capacity  our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses  the impact of our restructuring programs on our productivity and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business  and factors that affect our access to bank financing and the debt and equity capital markets that could impair our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise  including interest rate fluctuations  our ability to maintain compliance with financial covenants under our existing credit facilities and other limitations imposed by our credit facilities or arising from our substantial leverage or arising out of the sudden reduction in the general availability of lending from banks or the related increase in cost to obtain bank financing 

table of contents our ability to service our long term debt including our senior subordinated notes  to remain in compliance with the various covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and to fund working capital  capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to  among other things  our future operating performance as well as to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  some of which may be beyond our control 
if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations  we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives 
there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or  if available  will be at rates or prices acceptable to us 
the united states and global credit markets are currently experiencing an unprecedented contraction 
as a result of the tightening credit markets  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through december  to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans  our liquidity may be adversely impacted 
operations our operational cash flows are affected by the ability of our operations to generate cash  and our management of our assets and liabilities  including both working capital and long term assets and liabilities 
each of these components is discussed herein ebitda as discussed in note long term debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  our debt covenants require us to stay within certain leverage ratios based on the consolidated earnings net income before interest expense  provisions for income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense for the last four quarters 
consolidated ebitda  as defined under the documents for our senior bank facilities totaled approximately million for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended december  if we were not in compliance with the covenants contained in our senior bank facilities  the holders of our senior bank facilities could cause all outstanding amounts as of december   which were comprised of million of our term loans  to be due and payable immediately and the million of letters of credit to be fully cash collateralized 
if we were unable to repay  refinance or restructure that indebtedness  the holders could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness 
in addition  any such event of default or declaration of acceleration could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
as of december  approximately million remained outstanding under other debt that may be accelerated based on this covenant 
working capital working capital fluctuates depending on end market demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables  inventory and payables 
in times of escalating demand  our working capital requirements may increase as we purchase additional manufacturing inputs and increase production 
our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs  which may require us to use cash for severance payments  asset transfers and contract termination costs 
our working capital  including cash  was million at december  our working capital  excluding cash and cash equivalents  was million at december   and has fluctuated between million and million over the last eight quarter ends 

table of contents the components of our working capital at december  and are set forth below in millions  followed by explanations for changes between and for cash  and cash equivalents and any other changes greater than million december  change current assets cash and cash equivalents receivables  net inventories  net other current assets deferred income taxes total current assets current liabilities accounts payable accrued expenses income taxes payable accrued interest deferred income on sales to distributors current portion of long term debt total current liabilities net working capital the increase of million in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to million in cash provided by operating activities  million of cash provided by investing activities  which includes million of cash acquired as part of the amis acquisition and million of cash acquired as part of the catalyst acquisition  partially offset by million in cash used in financing activities 
the increase of million in receivables  net is primarily due to receivables from the acquisitions held at year end of million from amis and million from catalyst  offset by the decline in accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of due to decreasing revenues 
the increase of million in inventory is primarily the result of raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventory held at year end of million from the acquisition of amis and million from the acquisition of catalyst as well as a reduction in shipments to customers during the last quarter of  due to the downturn in the macroeconomic environment 
the decrease of million in other current assets is primarily due to usage of supply agreement prepayment of inventory with adi in connection with our acquisition of the ptc business partially offset by increases from acquisitions of million from amis and million from catalyst held at year end 
the increase of million in accounts payable is the result of liabilities assumed from the catalyst acquisition of million and million from the amis acquisition held at year end  offset by decreases due to lower inventory builds in the fourth quarter of the increase of million in accrued expenses is primarily due to liabilities assumed from the amis and catalyst acquisitions of million and million held at year end  respectively partially offset by timing of payments 
the decrease of million in deferred income on sales to distributors is primarily due to decreases in revenues compared to prior period 

table of contents the increase of million in current portion of long term debt was primarily due to obligations under the new philippine  belgian and japanese loans  maturing chinese loans and additional capital lease obligations 
see note long term debt for further discussion long term assets and liabilities our long term assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  foreign tax receivables and capitalized debt issuance costs

key financing events overview since we became an independent company as a result of our recapitalization  we have had relatively high levels of long term debt as compared to our principal competitors 
our long term debt includes amounts outstanding under our senior bank facilities  which contain covenants with which we were in compliance as of december  during the second half of  we began undertaking measures to reduce our long term debt  reduce related interest costs and  in some cases  extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility 
these measures have continued in set forth below is a summary of the key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years 
february amendment to senior bank facilities in february  we refinanced the term loans under our senior bank facilities to reduce the interest rate from libor plus to libor plus 
the amended and restated credit agreement also provided for a step down provision that would further reduce the interest rate to libor plus if we maintain a specified credit rating and meet a specified leverage ratio test that first applied based on the results 
march amendment to senior bank facilities the credit agreement relating to our senior bank facilities included a provision requiring an annual calculation of excess cash flow as defined and the application of a portion of that excess cash flow as a prepayment of loans outstanding under the agreement 
in march  we obtained an amendment of this provision that required repayment only at the election of the debt holders 

table of contents april equity offering on april   we completed a public offering of our common stock registered pursuant to a shelf registration statement originally filed with the sec on january  in connection with this offering  we issued approximately million shares which includes million shares issued to cover over allotments at a price of per share 
the net proceeds from this offering received by us were million after deducting the underwriting discount of million per share and offering expenses of million 
the net proceeds were primarily used to partially fund the purchase of lsi s gresham  oregon wafer fabrication facility during the second quarter of  which had a total purchase price of million 
july exchange offer for zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due on april   we commenced a cash tender offer for all of our then outstanding senior subordinated notes due in order to finance the cash tender offer  we issued million of zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the notes after deducting commissions and estimated offering expenses of million  which were capitalized as debt issuance costs and are being amortized using the effective interest method through the first put date of april  the notes do not bear cash interest  nor does the principal amount accrete 
the effective interest rate of the notes resulting from the amortization of debt issuance costs is 
the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured senior subordinated basis by certain of our existing domestic subsidiaries 
in june  we commenced an offer to exchange all of our then outstanding million principal amount of zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due the old notes for a like principal amount of the new notes plus an exchange fee of per  principal amount of their old notes validly tendered and accepted for exchange 
the new notes contain a net share settlement feature  which reduce the amount of shares included in diluted net income per share 
on july   we issued million aggregate principal amount of new notes that are convertible into cash up to the par value at a conversion rate of shares per  principal under certain circumstances 
the excess of fair value over par value is convertible into stock 
the exchange expired on july   and of the aggregate principal amount of the old notes were tendered and subsequently exchanged 
on august   we entered into transactions with four of the remaining holders of the old notes and exchanged  aggregate principal amount of old notes that were not tendered in the exchange 
these holders exchanged their old notes for new notes on the same terms as the exchange offer discussed above 
we intend to repurchase or redeem all of the old notes that remain outstanding  subject to market conditions 
the new notes are convertible by holders into cash and shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes subject to adjustment in certain events  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
we will settle conversion of all notes validly tendered for conversion in cash and shares of our common stock  if applicable  subject to our right to pay the share amount in additional cash 
holders may convert their notes under the following circumstances i during the five business day period immediately following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of notes for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate  ii upon occurrence of the specified transactions described in the indenture relating to the notes  or iii after april  we determined that the conversion option based on a trading price condition meets the definition of a derivative  and should be bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for separately 
however  the fair value of this feature was determined to be de minimis at the date of issuance and we continue to evaluate the significance of this feature on a quarterly basis 
the notes will mature on april  beginning april   we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  for cash at a price of of the principal amount 
if a holder elects to convert its notes in connection with the occurrence of specified fundamental changes that occurs prior to april   the holder will be entitled to receive  in addition to cash and shares of common stock equal to the conversion rate  an additional 
table of contents number of shares of common stock  in each case as described in the indenture

the notes will also be effectively subordinated to any of our or our subsidiaries secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness 
in november of  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our convertible notes  subject to certain conditions 
we repurchased million of aggregate principal of our zero coupon senior subordinated notes due for million 
the million gain was the result of the repurchase of zero coupon senior subordinated notes due and was offset by the write off of million of the proportionate share of the remaining capitalized closing costs related to the zero coupon senior subordinated notes due  resulting in a net gain on debt repurchase of million 
the average asking price of the notes repurchased was approximately of the coupon

note significant accounting policies of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report contains a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations 
we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue 
we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to original equipment manufacturers  electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors 
we also generate revenue  although to a much lesser extent  from manufacturing services provided to customers 
distributor revenue is recognized in various ways within the industry  some recognize revenue upon sale to the distributor  while others  like us  recognize the revenue when the sale is made to the end customer 
additionally  there can often be a lag in the data collection from distributors  which makes the calculation of revenue recognition challenging 
due to our high distributor sales  revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy 
we recognize revenue on sales to original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers and sales of manufacturing services net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is generally upon shipment  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction  reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when the distributor informs us that they have resold the products to the end user 
inaccuracies in the sales or inventory data provided to us by our distributors can therefore result in inaccuracy in our reporting revenues 
as a result of our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors  we defer the related revenue and margin on sales to distributors 
although payment terms vary  most distributor agreements require payment within days 
taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions  including value added and excise taxes  are presented on a net basis excluded from revenues in the statement of operations 
sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience 
our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 
sales to distributors  however  are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slow moving products 
under our general agreements  distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book 
in addition  agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns 
however  since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product  due to our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors  sales returns and allowances have minimal impact on our results of operations 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers  estimated returns and allowances  and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized  and are netted against revenues 
given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products  our actual returns and allowances and warranty claims have not traditionally fluctuated significantly from period to period  and our returns and allowances and warranty provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 
we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will  at the time of shipment  be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications 
our standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of i three years from the date of shipment or ii the period of time specified in the customer s standard warranty provided that the customer s standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge 
at the time revenue is recognized  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenues 
in addition  we also 
table of contents offer cash discounts to customers for payments received by us within an agreed upon time  generally days after shipment 
we accrue reserves for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenues  based on experience with each customer 
freight and handling costs are included in cost of revenues and are recognized as period expense during the period in which they are incurred 
inventories 
we carry our inventories not related to an acquisition at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end user demand 
these provisions can influence our results from operations 
for example  when demand falls for a given part  all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved  impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit 
if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold  we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin 
however  the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded 
although we do sell some products that have previously been written down  such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material  except for the sale of obsolete leaded parts during the first quarter of for approximately million 
upon the acquisition of a company such as amis  catalyst and the adi ptc business we used management estimates to determine the fair value of the inventory as of the acquisition date 
the methodology involves stepping up the value of acquired finished goods and work in process to expected sales value less variable costs to dispose 
for the year ended december  approximately million of initial million in the inventory step up for the catalyst  amis and adi acquisitions has been expensed to the statement of operations since the inventory was shipped to the customer  leaving million in inventory at december  as this inventory is shipped to customers  it will significantly decrease the gross margin reported on those future sales until the inventory is completely sold 
deferred tax valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided  the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
in the fourth quarter of  a valuation allowance was established for our domestic deferred tax assets and a portion of our foreign deferred tax assets 
additionally  throughout  and  no incremental domestic deferred tax benefits were recognized 
as of december  and  gross deferred tax assets were million and million  respectively  and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance are monitored on an ongoing basis 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property  plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results 
we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset 
the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests 
in recent years  most of our assets that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned  sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities 
in some instances  these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value 
when material  these gains are recorded in the restructuring  asset impairment and other  net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

table of contents goodwill 
we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit containing our goodwill with the related carrying amount 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the reporting unit s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
our methodologies used for valuing goodwill during have not changed since we have determined that our product families  which are components of our operating segments  constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill under sfas no 
 because they are one level below the operating segment  they constitute individual businesses as defined in eitf no 
 determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business and our segment management regularly reviews the operating results of each product family 
as of each acquisition date  all goodwill acquired was assigned to the product families that were expected to benefit from the synergies of the respective acquisition 
the amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit as of the acquisition date 
we determined the fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach  which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using management s assumptions and forecasts as of the acquisition date 
we perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year 
during the first step of our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill for six of our product families may not be recoverable 
after completing the second step of our annual impairment analysis for those six product families  we recognized a total charge of million  of which million was from our custom and foundry product group  million from our automotive and power regulation group  million from our digital and consumer products group and million from our computing products group 
we used the income approach  based on estimated future cash flows  to perform the goodwill impairment test 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross profits  operating expenses  and industry trends 
the material assumptions used for the income approach were five years of projected net cash flows  a discount rate of and a long term growth rate of 
we considered historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates to use in our analyses 
the total fair value of the six impaired reporting units was million 
a one percentage point change in the discount rate would have impacted the fair value of the six impaired reporting units tested by approximately million 
a one percentage point change in the long term growth rate would have impacted the fair value by approximately million 
our next annual test for impairment is expected to be performed in our fourth quarter of  however  further declines in operating results and in our business outlook  primarily due to the current macroeconomic environment  may result in the need for earlier reassessments of the recoverability of our goodwill and may result in material impairment charges in future periods 
defined benefit plans 
we maintain pension plans covering certain of our employees 
for financial reporting purposes  net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate for plan obligations  assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees 
all of these assumptions are based upon management s judgment  considering all known trends and uncertainties 
actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans 
for example  as of december   
table of contents a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately million 
valuation of stock compensation 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice based option valuation model 
the lattice model uses a constant volatility  an employee exercise behavior model based on an analysis of historical exercise behavior  and the treasury yield curve to calculate the fair value of shares issued for each option grant 
we continue to use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan 
contingencies 
we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
based on the available information  we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable

revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  as well as the goodwill acquired 
significant changes from current practice resulting from sfas r include the expansion of the definitions of a business and a business combination 
for all business combinations whether partial  full or step acquisitions  the acquirer will record of all assets and liabilities of the acquired business  including goodwill  generally at their fair values  contingent consideration will be recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date and  for certain arrangements  changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings until settlement  and acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs will be expensed rather than treated as part of the cost of the acquisition 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is not permitted 
our adoption of sfas r relates specifically to future acquisitions and will be applied to the extent that future acquisitions occur

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we have determined that the adoption of sfas on january  will have a significant impact on our balance sheet with an increase equity in the amount of approximately million based on december  balance of minority interest 
additionally  the amount of net income attributed to the noncontrolling interest will now be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement

apb fsp 
the fsp specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments that permit or require the issuer to pay cash upon conversion should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
we will need to apply the guidance retrospectively to all past periods presented  even to instruments that have matured  converted  or otherwise been extinguished as of the effective date 
the fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
at december   our long term debt including current maturities totaled  million 
we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt  which totaled million 
we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt 
a basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately million 
however  some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase 
one of our foreign exchange hedging agreement has a provision for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving facility is less than million 
a majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  as a multinational business  we also conduct certain of these activities through transactions denominated in a variety of other currencies 
we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge firm commitments and reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows 
gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments 
this strategy reduces  but does not eliminate  the short term impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
for example  changes in exchange rates may affect the foreign currency sales price of our products and can lead to increases or decreases in sales volume to the extent that the sales price of comparable products of our competitors are less or more than the sales price of our products 
our policy prohibits speculation on financial instruments  trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures  or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure
