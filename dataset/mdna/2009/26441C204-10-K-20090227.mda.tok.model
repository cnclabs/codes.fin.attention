objectives 
planning for future capital expansion and the related regulatory cost recovery structures was a primary focus in over the period through  duke energy plans to spend approximately billion on capital expenditures  with approximately billion anticipated to support the us franchised electric and gas segment 
during and early  duke energy achieved important milestones with various state and federal regulators related to future capital projects 
in the carolinas  the north carolina department of environment and natural resources denr issued the final air permit for cliffside unit  the state of the art coal generation unit at duke energy carolinas existing cliffside steam station and duke energy carolinas entered into an engineering  procurement  construction and commissioning services agreement with an affiliate of the shaw group  inc related to participation in the construction of cliffside unit  which has a current cost estimate of approximately billion  which includes approximately billion of allowance for funds used during construction afudc 
on october   duke energy carolinas submitted revised hazardous air pollutant emissions determination documentation including revised emission source information to north carolina department of air quality daq indicating that no maximum achievable control technology mact or mact like requirements apply since cliffside unit has been demonstrated to be a minor source of hazardous air pollutants 
on october   duke energy carolinas filed to amend its air permit to include emission limits to assure the public of the minor source status of cliffside unit as of december   the cliffside unit project was approximately complete 
duke energy carolinas is also continuing to seek all necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed william states lee iii nuclear station  including december filings of a combined construction and operating license col application with the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  which was approved in february  and requests to incur up to million in development costs through  which were approved in although these actions are necessary steps as management continues to pursue the option of building a new nuclear plant  submitting these applications does not commit duke energy carolinas to build a nuclear unit 
in indiana  the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc issued an order in november granting duke energy indiana a certificate of public convenience and necessity cpcn for the proposed megawatt mw integrated gasification combined cycle igcc power plant at the edwardsport generating station  and construction is underway 
the order also approved the timely recovery of costs related to the project 
on january   the iurc approved duke energy indiana s first semi annual igcc rider including a new cost estimate for the igcc project of billion including approximately million of afudc and cost recovery associated with a study on carbon capture 
duke energy indiana has begun construction on the edwardsport igcc plant and entered into a million engineering  procurement and construction management agreement with bechtel power corporation in december in connection with the construction of the plant 
management is continuing its focus on reducing regulatory lag  which refers to the period of time between making an investment and earning a return and recovering that investment 
new legislation sb was passed on april  and signed by the governor of ohio on may  the new law codifies the public utility commission of ohio s puco authority to approve an electric utility s standard service offer through an electric security plan esp  which would allow for pricing structures similar to the current rate stabilization plan rsp in ohio 
on july   duke 
table of contents part ii energy ohio filed a new generation pricing formula to be effective january   when the rsp is scheduled to expire 
among other things  the plan provides pricing mechanisms for compensation related to the advanced energy  renewables and energy efficiency portfolio standards established by sb on october  duke energy ohio filed a stipulation which results in a residential net rate increase of in and in  and a non residential rate increase of in  and the stipulation also allows the recovery of expenditures incurred to deploy smartgrid infrastructure modernization technology on the distribution system 
the recovery of such expenditures  net of savings  is subject to an annual residential revenue cap 
further  the stipulation allows for the implementation of a new energy efficiency compensation model  referred to as save a watt  to achieve the energy efficiency mandate pursuant to the recent electric energy legislation 
on december   the puco issued its finding and order  which adopted a modified stipulation approving duke energy ohio s esp 
specifically  the puco modified the stipulation to permit certain non residential customers to opt out of utility sponsored energy efficiency initiatives and to allow residential governmental aggregation customers who leave duke energy ohio s system to avoid some charges 
applications for rehearing of the puco s decision have been filed by environmental groups and a residential customer advocate group 
prior to december   commercial power did not apply the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  sfas no 
due to the comprehensive electric deregulation legislation passed by the state of ohio in the approval of the esp and sb substantially increased the puco s oversight authority over generation in the state of ohio  including giving the puco complete approval of generation rates and the establishment of an earnings test to determine if a utility has earned significantly excessive earnings 
duke energy ohio determined that certain costs and related rates riders of commercial power s operations related to generation serving native load meet the criteria established by sfas no 
for regulatory accounting treatment 
as a result of the reapplication of sfas no 
to certain portions of commercial power s operations  commercial power s future results will be subject to less volatility that had been caused by the timing of under and over collections of certain costs  as well as the impacts of mark to market activity on certain coal and power derivatives 
on february   duke energy ohio reached a settlement agreement with the puco staff and all of the intervening parties on its request for an increase in natural gas base rates 
the settlement called for an annual revenue increase of approximately million in base revenue  or over current revenue  permitted continued recovery of costs through for duke energy ohio s accelerated gas main replacement program and permitted recovery of carrying costs on gas stored underground via its monthly gas cost adjustment filing 
certain rate design issues  which were unresolved at the time of the settlement  are currently under appeal at the ohio supreme court 
on june   duke energy ohio filed notice with the puco that it will seek a rate increase for electric delivery service of approximately million  or on total electric revenues  to be effective in the second quarter of management expects the rate case to be resolved by mid in addition  duke energy intends to file for electric rate increases in north carolina and south carolina in  with rates becoming effective in global climate change was another primary focus of management during duke energy s strategy for meeting customer demand while building a sustainable business that allows our customers and our shareholders to prosper in a carbon constrained environment includes significant commitments to renewable energy  customer energy efficiency  advanced nuclear power  advanced clean coal and high efficiency natural gas electric generating plants  and retirement of older less efficient coal fired power plants 
in order to expand its wind energy operations  commercial power  through duke energy generation services degs  acquired the wind power development assets of energy investor funds from tierra energy in may and  in september  acquired catamount energy corporation catamount from diamond castle partners 
degs currently has approximately net mw of wind energy in operation and well over  mw of wind energy projects in the development pipeline 
on june   duke energy carolinas filed an application with the ncuc for approval of a solar photovoltaic pv distributed generation program 
the application seeks authorization to invest approximately million to install approximately solar pv facilities on customer rooftops and other customer and company owned property over a two year period  resulting in a total generating capacity of mw 
on october   duke energy carolinas filed rebuttal testimony  agreeing to reduce the size of the program to an investment of approximately million to install a total generating capacity of mw to address concerns raised by other parties to the proceeding 
on december   the ncuc issued its order granting the cpcn subject to certain conditions 
management is also making progress on increasing the role energy efficiency will have in meeting customers growing energy needs 
energy efficiency is considered a fifth fuel in the portfolio available to meet customers growing needs for electricity  along with coal  nuclear  natural gas and renewable energy 
during  new energy efficiency plans were filed in north carolina  south carolina and indiana and energy efficiency programs were expanded in both kentucky and ohio 
the energy efficiency plans filed in north carolina  
table of contents part ii south carolina and indiana are save a watt programs that would compensate duke energy for verified reductions in energy use and be available to all customer groups 
in north carolina  the ncuc ruled on february  to approve the proposed energy efficiency plan but did not approve cost recovery as the ncuc requested additional information regarding the earnings potential under the proposed save a watt recovery mechanism 
in south carolina the pscsc issued a directive rejecting duke energy carolinas save a watt energy efficiency plan on february  in indiana  a settlement agreement was filed with the iurc between duke energy indiana and several intervenors and an evidentiary hearing is expected to occur in the first quarter of on december   duke energy kentucky filed an application for a save a watt energy efficiency plan 
the application seeks a new energy efficiency recovery mechanism similar to what was proposed in ohio and indiana 
the esp approved by the puco  as discussed above  includes certain stipulations for duke energy ohio s energy efficiency programs 
overall  the regulatory and legislative accomplishments during have positioned duke energy well for and beyond 
duke energy objectives and beyond 
management of duke energy continues to focus on the following objectives pursue a balanced approach to meeting future energy needs by pursuing new supply options  including energy efficiency  coal gasification  advanced pulverized coal  nuclear  natural gas fired generation and renewable energy  while considering whether they are available  affordable  reliable and clean  pursue low carbon and no carbon solutions for meeting future energy needs in anticipation of a carbon constrained world  control costs  run the businesses efficiently and provide excellent customer service  and meet financial objectives and  for the long term  deliver on its promise to shareholders by steadily growing earnings and dividends 
the majority of future earnings are anticipated to be contributed from us franchised electric and gas  which consists of duke energy s regulated businesses that currently own a capacity of approximately  megawatts of generation 
the regulated generation portfolio consists of a mix of coal  nuclear  natural gas and hydroelectric generation  with the substantial majority of all of the sales of electricity coming from coal and nuclear generation facilities 
commercial power has net capacity of approximately  megawatts of regulated and unregulated generation  excluding wind assets  of which approximately  megawatts serves retail customers under the esp in ohio 
approximately of international energy s net capacity of approximately  megawatts of installed generation capacity in latin america consists of base load hydroelectric capacity that carries a low level of dispatch risk  in addition  for approximately of international energy s contractible capacity in latin america is either currently contracted or receives a system capacity payment 
as a result of the downturn in the economy  duke energy has experienced reductions in sales volumes  most notably with respect to industrial customers 
management anticipates that recessionary pressures will continue in  resulting in essentially flat kilowatt hour sales in both the carolinas and the midwest service territories 
in order to address these pressures  management is focused on containing costs and achieving constructive regulatory outcomes to reduce regulatory lag 
as mentioned earlier  during the five year period from to  duke energy anticipates total capital expenditures of approximately billion 
of this amount  approximately is expected to be spent on committed projects  including base load power plants to meet long term growth in customer demand  ongoing environmental projects  and nuclear fuel 
approximately of capital expenditures are expected to be used primarily for overall system maintenance  customer connections  and corporate expenditures 
although these expenditures are ultimately necessary to ensure overall system maintenance and reliability  the timing of the expenditures may be influenced by broad economic conditions and customer growth 
the remaining planned capital expenditures are of a discretionary nature and relate to growth opportunities in which duke energy may invest  provided there are opportunities to meet return expectations along with assurance of constructive regulatory treatment in the regulated businesses 
capital expenditures are currently estimated to be approximately billion in these expenditures are principally related to expansion plans  maintenance costs  environmental spending related to clean air act requirements and nuclear fuel 
duke energy is committed to adding base load capacity at a reasonable price while modernizing the current generation facilities by replacing older  less efficient plants with cleaner  more efficient plants 
significant expansion projects include the new igcc plant at duke energy indiana s edwardsport generating station  a new mw coal unit at duke energy carolinas existing cliffside facility in north carolina and new gas fired generation units at duke energy carolinas existing dan river and buck steam stations  as well as other additions due to system growth 
additionally  duke energy is evaluating the potential construction of the william states lee iii nuclear power plant in cherokee county  south carolina 
costs related to environmental spending are expected to decrease over the five year period as the upgrades to comply with the new environmental regulations are completed 
duke energy anticipates capital expenditures at commercial power will primarily relate to growth opportunities  such as renewable energy generation projects and environmental control equipment  as well as maintenance on existing plants 
capital expenditures at 
table of contents part ii international energy  which will be funded with cash held or raised by international energy  will primarily be for strategic growth opportunities  as well as maintenance on existing plants 
duke energy does not currently anticipate any additional capital investment related to its investment in the crescent jv 
with the exception of equity issuances to fund the dividend reinvestment plan and other internal plans  duke energy does not currently anticipate funding capital expenditures with the issuance of common equity in the foreseeable future  but rather through the use of available cash and cash equivalents as well as the issuance of incremental debt 
further  at this time  duke energy does not believe the recent market developments significantly impact its ability to obtain financing and fully expects to have access to liquidity in the capital markets at reasonable rates and terms 
additionally  duke energy has access to unsecured revolving credit facilities  which are not restricted upon general market conditions  with aggregate bank commitments of approximately billion 
at december   duke energy has available borrowing capacity of approximately billion under this facility 
for further information related to management s assessment of liquidity and capital resources  including known trends and uncertainties  see liquidity and capital resources below 
as the majority of duke energy s anticipated future capital expenditures are related to its regulated operations  a risk to duke energy is the ability to recover costs related to such expansion in a timely manner 
energy legislation passed in north carolina and south carolina in provides  among other things  mechanisms for duke energy to recover financing costs for new nuclear or coal base load generation during the construction phase 
in indiana  duke energy has received approval to recover its development costs for the new igcc plant at the edwardsport generating station 
duke energy has received approval for nearly million of future federal tax credits related to costs to be incurred for the modernization of cliffside unit  as well as the igcc plant in indiana 
in addition  duke energy has received general assurances from the ncuc that the north carolina allocable portion of development costs associated with the william states lee iii nuclear station will be recoverable through a future rate case proceeding as long as the costs are deemed prudent and reasonable 
duke energy does not anticipate beginning construction of the proposed nuclear power plant without adequate assurance of cost recovery from the state legislators or regulators 
in summary  duke energy is coordinating its future capital expenditure requirements with regulatory initiatives in order to ensure adequate and timely cost recovery while continuing to provide low cost energy to its customers 
economic factors for duke energy s business 
duke energy s business model provides diversification between stable regulated businesses like us franchised electric and gas and certain portions of commercial power s operations  and the traditionally higher growth businesses like the unregulated portion of commercial power s operations and international energy 
as was the case throughout  all of duke energy s businesses can be negatively affected by sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy  including low market prices of commodities  all of which are beyond duke energy s control  and could impair duke energy s ability to meet its goals for and beyond 
declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns would reduce overall electricity sales and lessen duke energy s cash flows  especially as industrial customers reduce production and  thus  consumption of electricity 
a weakening economy could also impact duke energy s customer s ability to pay  causing increased delinquencies  slowing collections and lead to higher than normal levels of accounts receivables  bad debts and financing requirements 
a portion of us franchised electric and gas business risk is mitigated by its regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of fuel costs under fuel adjustment clauses 
the approval of the esp in ohio also helps mitigate a portion of the risk associated with certain portions of commercial power s generation operations by providing mechanisms for recovery of certain costs associated with  among other things  fuel and purchased power for native load customers 
if negative market conditions should persist over time and estimated cash flows over the lives of duke energy s individual assets  including goodwill  do not exceed the carrying value of those individual assets  asset impairments may occur in the future under existing accounting rules and diminish results of operations 
a change in management s intent about the use of individual assets held for use versus held for sale could also result in impairments or losses 
duke energy s goals can also be substantially at risk due to the regulation of its businesses 
duke energy s businesses in the united states are subject to regulation on the federal and state level 
regulations  applicable to the electric power industry  have a significant impact on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate 
changes to regulations are ongoing and duke energy cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that any future changes will have on its business 
duke energy s earnings are impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices 
exposure to commodity prices generates higher earnings volatility in the unregulated businesses as there are timing differences as to when such costs are recovered in rates 
to mitigate these risks  duke energy enters into derivative instruments to effectively hedge some  but not all  known exposures 

table of contents part ii additionally  duke energy s investments and projects located outside of the united states expose duke energy to risks related to laws of other countries  taxes  economic conditions  fluctuations in currency rates  political conditions and policies of foreign governments 
changes in these factors are difficult to predict and may impact duke energy s future results 
duke energy also relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not met by cash flow from operations 
an inability to access capital at competitive rates or at all could adversely affect duke energy s ability to implement its strategy 
market disruptions or a downgrade of duke energy s credit rating may increase its cost of borrowing or adversely affect its ability to access one or more sources of liquidity 
additionally  if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there are no assurances that commitments made by lenders under duke energy s credit facilities will be available if needed as a source of funding due to the turmoil throughout the financial services industry

table of contents part ii year ended december  as compared to december  operating revenues 
the increase was driven primarily by a million increase in fuel revenues including emission allowances driven primarily by higher fuel rates in all regions and legislative changes that allow duke energy carolinas to collect additional purchased power and environmental compliance costs from retail customers 
fuel revenues represent sales to both retail and wholesale customers  and a million increase related to substantial completion in of the sharing of anticipated merger savings through rate decrement riders with regulated customers 
partially offsetting these increases were a million decrease in weather adjusted sales volumes to retail customers reflecting the overall declining economic conditions  which are primarily impacting the industrial sector  a million decrease in retail rates and rate riders primarily related to the new retail base rates implemented in north carolina in the first quarter of  net of increases in recoveries of duke energy indiana s environmental compliance costs from retail customers and higher gas base rates implemented in the second quarter of for duke energy ohio  and a million decrease in gwh thousand cubic feet mcf sales to retail customers due to milder weather in compared to while weather statistics for heating degree days in were favorable compared to  this favorable impact was more than offset by the impact of fewer cooling degree days in compared to operating expenses 
the increase was driven primarily by a million increase in fuel expense including purchased power and natural gas purchases for resale primarily due to higher coal and natural gas prices and increased purchased power 
this increase also reflects a million reimbursement in first quarter of previously incurred fuel expenses resulting from a settlement between duke energy carolinas and us department of justice resolving duke energy carolinas used nuclear fuel litigation against the department of energy doe 
the settlement between the parties was finalized on march   a million increase in depreciation due primarily to additional capital spending  and a million increase in operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to higher scheduled outage and maintenance costs at nuclear and fossil generating plants  storm costs primarily in the midwest related to hurricane ike in september net of deferral of a portion of the ohio and kentucky storm costs associated with hurricane ike  increased capacity costs due to additional contracts that were entered into in late to ensure customer electricity needs were met despite ongoing drought conditions and increased power delivery maintenance charges to increase system reliability  partially offset by lower benefit costs including short term incentives 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in regulatory amortization expenses  including approximately million for the amortization of compliance costs related to north carolina clean air legislation  which was completed in this decrease was partially offset by the write off in of a portion of the investment in the gridsouth rto approximately million per a rate order from the ncuc 
other income and expenses  net 
the increase is due primarily to the equity component of afudc due to additional capital spending for ongoing construction projects and a favorable million iurc ruling 
ebit 
the increase resulted primarily from decreased regulatory amortization  the substantial completion of the required rate reductions due to the merger with cinergy and increased afudc 
these increases were partially offset by the impacts of the unfavorable economy on sales  milder weather  additional depreciation as rate base increased during  higher operation and maintenance costs  overall net lower retail rates and rate riders  and the doe settlement 
matters impacting future us franchised electric and gas results us franchised electric and gas continues to increase the number of retail customers served  maintain low costs and deliver high quality customer service in the carolinas and midwest  however  sales to all retail customer classes were negatively impacted by the economic downturn in  particularly sales to the industrial and residential sector 
these trends are expected to continue for some period into  and perhaps beyond  until the economy begins to recover 
the general decline in the textile industry in the carolinas  exacerbated by the struggling economy  is also expected to continue in  fueled by the expiration of certain import limitations related to foreign textile products

the increase was driven primarily by an million increase in regulated operating expenses for the first quarter of due to the merger with cinergy  a million increase in operating and maintenance expense primarily due to higher wage and benefit costs  including increased short term incentive costs  and maintenance costs at fossil and nuclear generating plants  partially offset by a one time million donation in the second quarter ordered by the ncuc as a condition of the cinergy merger  a million increase in fuel expense including purchased power primarily due to increased retail demand resulting from favorable weather conditions 
generation fueled by coal and natural gas  as well as purchases to meet retail customer requirements  increased significantly during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by a million reimbursement for previously incurred fuel expenses resulting from a settlement between duke energy carolinas and the us department of justice resolving duke energy s used nuclear fuel litigation against the department of energy doe

matters impacting future commercial power results commercial power s current strategy is focused on maximizing the returns and cash flows from its current portfolio  as well as growing its non regulated renewable energy portfolio 
results for commercial power are sensitive to changes in power supply  power demand  fuel prices and weather  as well as dependent upon completion of energy asset construction projects and tax credits on renewable energy production 
commercial power s generation operations in the midwest include generation assets located in ohio that are dedicated to serve ohio native load customers 
these assets  as excess capacity allows  also generate revenues through sales outside the native load customer base  and such revenue is termed non native 
prior to december   commercial power did not apply the provisions of sfas no 
due to the comprehensive electric deregulation legislation passed by the state of ohio in as described further below  effective december   the puco approved duke energy ohio s esp  which resulted in the reapplication of sfas no 
to certain portions of commercial power s operations as of that date 
from january  through december   commercial power had been operating under a rsp  which is a market based standard service offer 
although the rsp contained certain trackers that enhanced the potential for cost recovery  there was no assurance of stranded cost recovery upon the expiration of the rsp on december  since it was initially anticipated that  upon the expiration of the rsp  there would be a move to full competitive markets 
accordingly  commercial power did not apply the provisions of sfas no 
to any of its generation operations prior to december  in connection with the approval of the esp  duke energy ohio reassessed the applicability of sfas no 
to commercial power s generation operations as sb substantially increased the puco s oversight authority over generation in the state of ohio  including giving the puco complete approval of generation rates and the establishment of an earnings test to determine if a utility has earned significantly excessive earnings 
duke energy ohio determined that certain costs and related rates riders of commercial power s operations related to generation serving native load meet the criteria established by sfas no 
for regulatory accounting treatment as sb and duke energy s approved esp solidified the automatic recovery of certain costs of its generation serving native load and increased the likelihood that these operations will remain under a cost recovery model for certain costs for the foreseeable future 
under the esp  commercial power will bill for its native load generation via numerous riders 
sb and the esp resulted in the approval of the automatic recovery of certain of these riders  which includes  but is not limited to  a fuel and purchased power fpp rider and portions of a cost of environmental compliance aac rider 
accordingly  commercial power began applying sfas no 
to the corresponding rsp riders granting automatic recovery under the esp on december  the remaining portions of commercial power s ohio native load generation operations  revenues from which are reflected in rate riders for which the esp does not specifically allow automatic cost recovery  as well as all generation operations associated with non native customers  including commercial power s midwest gas fired generation assets  continue to not apply regulatory accounting as those operations do not meet the criteria of sfas no 
moreover  generation remains a competitive market in ohio and native load customers continue to have the ability to switch to alternative supplier for their electric generation service 
as customers switch  there is a risk that some or all of the regulatory assets will not be recovered through the established riders 
the level of switching to date has been insignificant 
duke energy ohio will continue to monitor the amount of native load customers that have switched to alternative suppliers when assessing the recoverability of its regulatory assets established for its native load generation operations 

table of contents part ii as a result of the reapplication of sfas no 
to certain portions of commercial power s operations  commercial power s future results will be subject to less volatility that had been caused by the timing of under and over collections of certain costs  as well as the impacts of mark to market activity on certain coal and power derivatives

critical accounting policies and estimates the application of accounting policies and estimates is an important process that continues to evolve as duke energy s operations change and accounting guidance evolves 
duke energy has identified a number of critical accounting policies and estimates that require the use of significant estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other various assumptions that they believe are reasonable at the time of application 
the estimates and judgments may change as time passes and more information about duke energy s environment becomes available 
if estimates and judgments are different than the actual amounts recorded  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to take into consideration the new information 
duke energy discusses its critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting policies with senior members of management and the audit committee  as appropriate 
duke energy s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
regulatory accounting duke energy accounts for certain of its regulated operations primarily us franchised electric and gas and certain portions of commercial power under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
as a result  duke energy records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap for non regulated entities 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for costs that either are not likely to or have yet to be incurred 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes  recent rate orders to other regulated entities  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
based on this continual assessment  management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
this assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels  and is subject to change in the future 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the asset write offs would be required to be recognized in operating income 
additionally  the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property  plant and equipment  nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of regulatory assets 
total regulatory assets were  million as of december  and  million as of december  total regulatory liabilities were  as of december  and  million as of december  for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters 
in order to apply the accounting provisions of sfas no 
and record regulatory assets and liabilities  the scope criteria in sfas no 
must be met 
management makes significant judgments in determining whether the scope criteria of sfas no 
are met for its operations  including determining whether revenue rates for services provided to customers are subject to approval by an independent  third party regulator  whether the regulated rates are designed to recover specific costs of providing the regulated service  and a determination of whether  in view of the demand for the regulated services and the level of competition  it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover the operations costs can be charged to and collected from customers 
this final criterion requires consideration of anticipated changes in levels of demand or competition  direct and indirect  during the recovery period for any capitalized costs 
if facts and circumstances change so that a portion of duke energy s regulated operations meet all of the scope criteria set forth in sfas no 
when such criteria had not been previously met  sfas no 
would be reapplied to all or a separable portion of the operations 
such reapplication includes adjusting the balance sheet for amounts that meet the definition of a regulatory asset or regulatory liability of sfas commercial power owns  operates and manages power plants in the midwestern united states 
commercial power s generation asset fleet consists of duke energy ohio s generation in ohio  primarily coal fired assets  that are dedicated to serve ohio native load 
table of contents part ii customers native load  and five midwestern gas fired non regulated generation assets that are not dedicated to serve ohio native load customers non native 
the non native generation operations are not accounted for under sfas no 
as these operations do not meet the scope criteria 
most of the generation asset native load output in ohio was contracted through the rsp through december  as discussed further in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  specifically note  summary of significant accounting policies and note  regulatory matters  beginning on december   commercial power reapplied the provisions of sfas no 
to certain portions of its native load operations due to the passing of sb and the approval of the esp 
however  other portions of commercial power s native load operations continue to not meet the scope criteria of sfas no 
 as certain costs of the native load operations do not result in a rate structure designed to recover the specific costs of that portion of the operations 
despite certain portions of the ohio native load operations not being subject to the accounting provisions of sfas no 
 all of commercial power s ohio native load operations rates are such to approval by the puco  and thus these operations are referred to here in as commercial power s regulated operations 
moreover  generation remains a competitive market in ohio and native load customers continue to have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service 
as customers switch  there is a risk that some or all of commercial power s regulatory assets will not be recovered through the established riders 
duke energy will continue to monitor the amount of native load customers that have switched to alternative suppliers when assessing the recoverability of its regulatory assets established for its native load generation operations 
no other operations within commercial power  and no operations within the international energy business segment  meet the criteria for accounting under sfas no 
substantially all of us franchised electric and gas s operations meet the scope criteria in sfas no 
and thus its costs of business and related revenues can result in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities  as described above 
goodwill impairment assessments at december  and  duke energy had goodwill balances of  million and  million  respectively 
duke energy evaluates the impairment of goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

the majority of duke energy s goodwill at december  and relates to the acquisition of cinergy in april  whose assets are primarily included in the us franchised electric and gas and commercial power segments 
the remainder relates to international energy s latin american operations 
as of the acquisition date  duke energy allocates goodwill to a reporting unit  which duke energy defines as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
as required by sfas no 
 duke energy performs an annual goodwill impairment test and updates the test between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
duke energy performs its annual impairment assessment as of august each year 
duke energy primarily uses a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units 
key assumptions used in the analysis include  but are not limited to  the use of an appropriate discount rate  estimated future cash flows and estimated run rates of operation  maintenance  and general and administrative costs 
in estimating cash flows  duke energy incorporates expected growth rates  regulatory stability and ability to renew contracts  as well as other factors  into its revenue and expense forecasts 
duke energy did not record any impairment on its goodwill as a result of the  or impairment tests required by sfas no 
one of the most significant assumptions that duke energy utilizes in determining the fair value of its reporting units is the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows 
management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the weighted average cost of capital wacc for each individual reporting unit 
the wacc takes into account both the cost of equity and pre tax cost of debt 
as each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations  including factors such as regulation  the wacc for each reporting unit may differ 
in determining the appropriate wacc for each of duke energy s reporting units  duke energy considered current and historical market data for risk free interest rates over a year period and applied an appropriate equity risk premium for the equity component of the wacc  and utilized credit ratings and appropriate risk premiums for the debt component 
duke energy also considered implied wacc s for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate wacc rates to use 
the discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of august  for each of duke energy s domestic reporting units were commensurate with the risks associated with each reporting unit and ranged from to 
for duke energy s international operations  a base discount rate of was used  with specific adders used for each separate jurisdiction in which international energy operates to reflect the differing risk profiles of the jurisdictions 
this resulted in discount rates for the august  goodwill impairment test for the international operations ranging from to 
additionally  estimated future cash flows are based on duke energy s internal business plan 
duke energy s internal business plan reflects management s assumptions related to customer usage and attrition based on internal data and economic data obtained from third party sources  as well as projected commodity pricing data 
the business plan assumes the occurrence of certain events in the 
table of contents part ii future  such as the outcome of future rate filings  future approved rates of returns on equity  anticipated earnings returns related to significant future capital investments  continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts 
management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operation  maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events 
should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions  revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of duke energy s reporting units to be significantly different in future periods 
these underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time  subsequent changes  particularly changes in the discount rates or growth rates inherent in management s estimates of future cash flows  could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill 
management continues to remain alert for any indicators that the fair value of a reporting unit could be below book value and will assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate 
the impairment analysis as of august  did not indicate that the fair value of any of duke energy s reporting units were less than its book value 
as an overall test of the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of the reporting units  duke energy reconciled the combined fair value estimates of its reporting units to its market capitalization as of august  the reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were reasonably representative of market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization 
additionally  duke energy would perform an interim impairment assessment should any events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
subsequent to august   management did not identify any indicators of potential impairment that required an update to the annual impairment assessment 
this reflects the fact that the majority of duke energy s business is in environments that are either fully or partially rate regulated 
in such environments  revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs  sales volumes and costs of capital 
accordingly  duke energy operates to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects  positive or negative  of significant swings in market or economic conditions 
however  management will continue to monitor changes in the business  as well as overall market conditions and economic factors that could require additional impairment assessments 
revenue recognition revenues on sales of electricity and gas  primarily at us franchised electric and gas  are recognized when either the service is provided or the product is delivered 
unbilled revenues are estimated by applying an average revenue kilowatt hour or per thousand cubic feet mcf for all customer classes to the number of estimated kilowatt hours or mcf s delivered but not billed 
the amount of unbilled revenues can vary significantly period to period as a result of factors including seasonality  weather  customer usage patterns and customer mix 
unbilled revenues  which are recorded as receivables in duke energy s consolidated balance sheets at december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
accounting for loss contingencies duke energy is involved in certain legal and environmental matters that arise in the normal course of business 
in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements  management makes judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and records a loss contingency based on the accounting guidance set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 which requires a loss contingency to be recognized when it is determined that it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
management regularly reviews current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts and scenarios that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties  such as federal  state and local courts and other regulators 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may differ from the actual outcome once the contingency is resolved  which could have a material impact on future results of operations  financial position and cash flows of duke energy 
duke energy has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and medical cost reimbursement relating to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from the exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities conducted by duke energy carolinas on its electric generation plants prior to amounts recognized as asbestos related reserves related to duke energy carolinas in the consolidated balance sheets totaled approximately  million and  million as of december  and  respectively  and are classified in other within deferred credits and other liabilities and other within current liabilities 
these reserves are based upon the minimum amount in duke energy s best estimate of the range of loss for current and future asbestos claims through management believes that it is possible there will be additional claims filed against duke energy carolinas after in light of the uncertainties inherent in a longer term fore 
table of contents part ii cast  management does not believe that they can reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after related to such potential claims 
asbestos related loss estimates incorporate anticipated inflation  if applicable  and are recorded on an undiscounted basis 
these reserves are based upon current estimates and are subject to greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
a significant upward or downward trend in the number of claims filed  the nature of the alleged injury  and the average cost of resolving each such claim could change our estimated liability  as could any substantial adverse or favorable verdict at trial 
a federal legislative solution  further state tort reform or structured settlement transactions could also change the estimated liability 
given the uncertainties associated with projecting matters into the future and numerous other factors outside our control  management believes that it is possible duke energy carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves 
duke energy has a third party insurance policy to cover certain losses related to duke energy carolinas asbestos related injuries and damages above an aggregate self insured retention of million 
duke energy carolinas cumulative payments began to exceed the self insurance retention on its insurance policy during the second quarter of future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by duke energy s third party insurance carrier 
the insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is  million in excess of the self insured retention 
insurance recoveries of approximately  million and  million related to this policy are classified in the consolidated balance sheets in other within investments and other assets and receivables as of december  and  respectively 
duke energy is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims 
management believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating

accounting for income taxes duke energy accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas no 
and fin deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain  duke energy may record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
prior to the adoption of fin on january   duke energy recorded tax contingencies based on the accounting guidance set forth in sfas no 
 which requires a contingency to be both probable and reasonably estimable for a loss to be recorded 
upon adoption of fin  duke energy began recording unrecognized tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns  including the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return  when a more likely than not threshold is met for a tax position and management believes that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
in accordance with fin  duke energy records the largest amount of the unrecognized tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position  assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and  if so  the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available 
significant management judgment is required in determining duke energy s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation recorded against duke energy s net deferred tax assets  if any 
in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets  management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income 
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items  including changes in income tax laws  duke energy s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods  as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities 
although management believes current estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates

duke energy made voluntary contributions to its db retirement plans of zero in  million in and million in in the first quarter of  duke energy made a voluntary contribution to its db retirement plans in of million 
additionally  during  duke energy contributed approximately million to its other post retirement benefit plans 
the calculation of pension expense  other post retirement benefit expense and duke energy s pension and other post retirement liabilities require the use of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and reported liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
duke energy believes that the most critical assumptions for pension and other post retirement benefits are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
additionally  medical and prescription drug cost trend rate assumptions are critical to duke energy s estimates of other post retirement benefits 
the prescription drug trend rate assumption resulted from the effect of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act modernization act 
duke energy plans duke energy and its subsidiaries including legacy cinergy businesses maintain non contributory defined benefit retirement plans plans 
the plans cover most us employees using a cash balance formula 
under a cash balance formula  a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits that are based upon a percentage which may vary with age and years of service of current eligible earnings and current interest credits 
certain legacy cinergy employees are covered under plans that use a final average earnings formula 
under a final average earnings formula  a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to a percentage of their highest year average earnings  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation maximum of years  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings times years of participation in excess of years 
duke energy also maintains non qualified  non contributory defined benefit retirement plans which cover certain executives 
duke energy and most of its subsidiaries also provide some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non contributory basis 
employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement  as defined in the plans 
duke energy recognized pre tax qualified pension cost of million in in  duke energy s qualified pension cost is expected to be approximately million lower than in as a result of the aforementioned approximate million db retirement plan contribution 
non qualified pension cost and other post retirement benefits cost are expected to remain approximately the same as for both pension and other post retirement plans  duke energy assumed that its plan s assets would generate a long term rate of return of as of december  the assets for duke energy s pension and other post retirement plans are maintained in a master trust 
the investment objective of the master trust is to achieve reasonable returns on trust assets  subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk  for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants 
the asset allocation target was set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile with respect to the trust 
us equities are held for their high expected return 
us equities  debt securities  and real estate are held for diversification 
investments within asset classes are to be diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers or investments 
duke energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the expected long term rate of return of for the plan s assets was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers 
the weighted average returns expected by asset classes were for us equities  for non us equities  for fixed income securities  and for real estate 
if duke energy had used a long term rate of in  pre tax pension expense would have been higher by approximately million and pre tax other post retirement expense would have been higher by less than million 
if duke energy had used a long term rate of pre tax pension expense would have been lower by approximately million and pre tax other post retirement expense would have been lower by less than million 
duke energy discounted its future us pension and other post retirement obligations using a rate of as of december  
table of contents part ii duke energy s us post retirement plan uses a medical care trend rate which reflects the near and long term expectation of increases in medical health care costs 
duke energy s us post retirement plan uses a prescription drug trend rate which reflects the near and long term expectation of increases in prescription drug health care costs 
as of december   the medical care trend rates were  which grades to by as of december   the prescription drug trend rate was  which grades to by if duke energy had used health care trend rates one percentage point higher  pre tax other post retirement expense would have been higher by million

future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in duke energy s pension and post retirement plans will impact duke energy s future pension expense and liabilities 
management cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future

liquidity and capital resources known trends and uncertainties at december   duke energy had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately billion  partially offset by approximately million of short term notes payable and commercial paper  which includes approximately million of borrowings by duke energy ohio under the master credit facility 
to fund its liquidity and capital requirements during  duke energy will rely primarily upon cash flows from operations  borrowings  equity issuances to fund the dividend reinvestment plan drip and other internal plans and its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the relatively stable operating cash flows of the us franchised electric and gas business segment compose a substantial portion of duke energy s cash flows from operations and it is anticipated that it will continue to do so for the next several years 
a material adverse change in operations  or in available financing  could impact duke energy s ability to fund its current liquidity and capital resource requirements 
ultimate cash flows from operations are subject to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  regulatory constraints  economic trends  and market volatility see item a 
risk factors for details 
duke energy projects capital and investment expenditures of approximately billion  primarily consisting of billion at us franchised electric and gas billion at commercial power billion at international and billion at other duke energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business sectors with an overall focus on positive net cash generation 
based on this goal  approximately percent of total projected capital expenditures are allocated to the us franchised electric and gas segment 
total us franchised electric and gas projected capital and investment expenditures include approximately billion for system growth  billion for maintenance and upgrades of existing plants and infrastructure to serve load growth  approximately billion of environmental expenditures  and approximately billion of nuclear fuel 
with respect to the capital expenditure plan  duke energy has flexibility within its billion budget to defer or eliminate certain spending should the broad economy continue to deteriorate 
of the billion budget  approximately billion relates to projects for which management has committed capital  including  but not limited to  the continued construction of cliffside unit and the edwardsport igcc plant  and management intends to spend those capital dollars in irrespective of broader economic factors 
approximately billion of projected capital expenditures are expected to be used primarily for overall system maintenance  customer connections  and corporate expenditures 
although these expenditures are ultimately necessary to ensure overall system maintenance and reliability  the timing of the expenditures may be influenced by broad economic conditions and customer growth  thus management has more flexibility in terms of when these dollars are actually spent 
the remaining planned capital expenditures of approximately billion are of a discretionary nature and relate to growth opportunities in which duke energy may invest  provided there are opportunities to meet return expectations along with assurance of constructive regulatory treatment in the regulated businesses 

table of contents part ii as a result of duke energy s significant commitment to modernize its generating fleet through the construction of new units  as well as its focus on increasing its renewable energy portfolio  the ability to cost effectively manage the construction phase of current and future projects is critical to ensuring full and timely recovery of costs of construction 
should duke energy encounter significant cost overruns above amounts approved by the various state commissions  and those amounts are disallowed for recovery in rates  future cash flows could be adversely impacted 
duke energy anticipates its debt to total capitalization ratio to remain at approximately in in january  duke energy issued million principal amount of senior notes 
proceeds from the issuance were used to redeem commercial paper and for general corporate purposes 
in  duke energy currently anticipates issuing approximately billion of additional debt at the operating subsidiary level  primarily for the purpose of funding capital expenditures 
due to the flexibility in the timing of projected capital expenditures  the timing and amount of debt issuances throughout could be influenced by changes in the timing of capital spending 
additionally  duke energy plans to generate approximately million of cash from the issuance of common stock under its drip and other internal plans 
in february  duke energy made an approximate million contribution to its pension plan 
at this time  duke energy does not believe the recent market developments significantly impact its ability to obtain financing and fully expects to have access to liquidity in the capital markets at reasonable rates and terms 
additionally  duke energy has access to unsecured revolving credit facilities  which are not restricted upon general market conditions  with aggregate bank commitments of approximately billion 
at december   duke energy has available borrowing capacity of approximately billion under this facility 
management currently believes that amounts available under its revolving credit facility are accessible should there be a need to generate additional short term financing in  such as the issuance of commercial paper  however  due to the sustained downturn in overall economic conditions  specifically in the financial services sector  there is no guarantee that commitments provided by financial institutions under the revolving credit facility will be available if needed 
management expects that cash flows from operations  issuances of debt and cash generated from the issuance of common stock under the drip and other internal plans will be sufficient to cover the funding requirements related to capital and investments expenditures  dividend payments and the contribution to the pension plan 
duke energy monitors compliance with all debt covenants and restrictions and does not currently believe it will be in violation or breach of its significant debt covenants during however  circumstances could arise that may alter that view 
if and when management had a belief that such potential breach could exist  appropriate action would be taken to mitigate any such issue 
duke energy also maintains an active dialogue with the credit rating agencies

in september  duke energy indiana and duke energy kentucky collectively entered into a million three year letter of credit agreement with a syndicate of banks  under which duke energy indiana and duke energy kentucky may request the issuance of letters of credit up to million and million  respectively  on their behalf to support various series of variable rate demand bonds issued or to be issued on behalf of either duke energy indiana or duke energy kentucky 
this credit facility  which is not part of duke energy s master credit facility  may not be used for any purpose other than to support the variable rate demand bonds issued by duke energy indiana and duke energy kentucky 
duke energy s debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants 
failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and or termination of the agreements 
as of december   duke energy was in compliance with all covenants related to its significant debt agreements 
in addition  some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment  or to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries 
none of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses

other financing matters 
in october  duke energy filed a registration statement form s with the sec 
under this form s  which is uncapped  duke energy  duke energy carolinas  duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts  prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings 
the registration statement also allows for the issuance of common stock by duke energy 
duke energy has paid quarterly cash dividends for consecutive years and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future 
there is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings  capital requirements  financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the board of directors 
it is currently anticipated that dividends per share will increase per share beginning in the third quarter of duke energy issues shares of its common stock to meet certain employee benefit and long term incentive obligations 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  duke energy began issuing authorized but unissued shares of common stock to fulfill obligations under its drip and other internal plans  including k plans 
duke energy currently anticipates issuing up to an aggregate of approximately million of common stock associated with these programs 
approximately million of common stock was issued during the fourth quarter of associated with these plans 
proceeds from all issuances of common stock  primarily related to the drip and other employee benefit plans  including employee exercises of stock options  were approximately million in  million in and approximately million in dividend and other funding restrictions of duke energy subsidiaries 
as discussed in note  to the consolidated financial statements regulatory matters  duke energy s wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to duke energy via dividend  advance or loan as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with duke energy s merger with cinergy 
additionally  certain other duke energy subsidiaries have other restrictions  such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to duke energy 
at december   the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of duke energy that may not be distributed to duke energy in the form of a loan or dividend is approximately billion 
however  duke energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated retained earnings account 
although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to duke energy  management does not believe these restrictions will have any significant impact on duke energy s ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations 

table of contents part ii off balance sheet arrangements duke energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties 
these arrangements include financial and performance guarantees  stand by letters of credit  guarantees of debt  surety bonds and indemnifications 
in contemplation of the spin off of the natural gas businesses on january   certain guarantees that had been issued by spectra energy capital were transferred to duke energy prior to the consummation of the spin off 
this resulted in duke energy recording an immaterial liability for certain guarantees that were previously grandfathered under the provisions of fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  and  therefore  had not been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
guarantees issued by spectra energy capital or its subsidiaries on or prior to december  remained with spectra energy capital subsequent to the spin off  except for certain guarantees that are in the process of being assigned to duke energy 
during this assignment period  duke energy has indemnified spectra energy capital against any losses incurred under these guarantee obligations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  guarantees and indemnifications  for further details of the guarantee arrangements 
most of the guarantee arrangements entered into by duke energy enhance the credit standing of certain subsidiaries  non consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities  enabling them to conduct business 
as such  these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk  which are not included on the consolidated balance sheets 
the possibility of duke energy  either on its own or on behalf of spectra energy capital through the aforementioned indemnification agreements  having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries  investees and other third parties  or the occurrence of certain future events 
due to the continued downturn in the overall economic environment  duke energy performed an assessment of its guarantee obligations as of december  to determine whether any sfas no 
liabilities have been triggered as a result of potential increased non performance risk by parties for which duke energy has issued guarantees 
based on the results of this analysis  as of december  management determined  with the exception of some insignificant amounts  that it is not probable that duke energy will have to perform under any guarantee obligations 
however  management will continue to monitor the financial condition of the third parties or non wholly owned entities for whom duke energy has issued guarantees on behalf of  including certain obligations related to crescent  to determine whether performance under these guarantees becomes probable in the future 
as of december   it is reasonably possible that duke energy could have exposure of approximately million under these guarantees should crescent fail to perform under its obligations associated with these projects  which would become more likely should crescent declare bankruptcy in the near future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  investments in unconsolidated affiliates and related party transactions  for a discussion of impairment losses recorded by crescent during and crescent s significant debt obligations as of december  issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of duke energy s operations 
thus  if duke energy discontinued issuing these guarantees  there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
duke energy ohio  duke energy indiana and duke energy kentucky have an agreement to sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections to cinergy receivables company llc cinergy receivables  which purchases  on a revolving basis  nearly all of the retail accounts receivable and related collections of duke energy ohio  duke energy indiana and duke energy kentucky

table of contents part ii contractual obligations duke energy enters into contracts that require payment of cash at certain specified periods  based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices 
the following table summarizes duke energy s contractual cash obligations for each of the periods presented 
it is expected that the majority of current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets will be paid in cash in contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years beyond in millions long term debt a capital leases a operating leases b purchase obligations h firm capacity payments c energy commodity contracts d other purchase obligations e other funding obligations f total contractual cash obligations g a see note to the consolidated financial statements  debt and credit facilities

payment amounts exclude million of debt issued by duke energy in january interest payments on variable rate debt instruments were calculated using interest rates derived from the interpolation of the forecast interest rate curve 
in addition  a spread was placed on top of the interest rates to aid in capturing the volatility inherent in projecting future interest rates 
b see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
c includes firm capacity payments that provide duke energy with uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity  and the option to convert natural gas to electricity at third party owned facilities tolling arrangements in some power locations throughout north america 
d includes contractual obligations to purchase physical quantities of electricity  coal and nuclear fuel  certain normal purchases  energy derivatives and hedges per sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

for contracts where the price paid is based on an index  the amount is based on forward market prices at december  for certain of these amounts  duke energy may settle on a net cash basis since duke energy has entered into payment netting agreements with counterparties that permit duke energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
e includes contracts for software  telephone  data and consulting or advisory services 
amount also includes contractual obligations for engineering  procurement and construction costs for new generation plants and nuclear plant refurbishments  environmental projects on fossil facilities  major maintenance of certain non regulated plants  and commitments to buy wind and ct turbines 
amount excludes certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand  for which the timing of the purchase can not be determined 
f primarily relates to future annual funding obligations to the ndtf see note to the consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations 
g the table above excludes certain obligations discussed herein related to amounts recorded within deferred credits and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of future cash flows necessary to settle these obligations 
the amount of cash flows to be paid to settle the asset retirement obligations is not known with certainty as duke energy may use internal resources or external resources to perform retirement activities 
as a result  cash obligations for asset retirement activities are excluded from the table above 
asset retirement obligations recognized on the consolidated balance sheets total  million and the fair value of the ndtf  which will be used to help fund these obligations  is  million at december  the table above excludes reserves for litigation  environmental remediation  asbestos related injuries and damages claims and self insurance claims see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies because duke energy is uncertain as to the timing of when cash payments will be required

also  the table above excludes deferred income taxes and investment tax credits on the consolidated balance sheets since cash payments for income taxes are determined based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year 
additionally  amounts related to uncertain tax positions are excluded from the table above due to uncertainty of timing of future payments 
h current liabilities  except for current maturities of long term debt  and purchase obligations reflected in the consolidated balance sheets have been excluded from the above table 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management policies duke energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices  credit exposure  interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks 
duke energy s chief executive officer and chief financial officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels 
the finance and risk management committee of the board of directors receives periodic updates from the treasurer and other members of management on market risk positions  corporate exposures  credit exposures and overall risk management activities 
the treasurer is responsible for the overall governance of managing credit risk and commodity price risk  including monitoring exposure limits 

table of contents part ii commodity price risk duke energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets 
price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities 
duke energy s exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors  including contract size  length  market liquidity  location and unique or specific contract terms 
duke energy employs established policies and procedures to manage its risks associated with these market fluctuations  which may include using various commodity derivatives  such as swaps  futures  forwards and options 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies and note to the consolidated financial statements  risk management and hedging activities  credit risk  and financial instruments 
validation of a contract s fair value is performed by an internal group separate from duke energy s deal origination areas 
while duke energy uses common industry practices to develop its valuation techniques  changes in duke energy s pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition 
hedging strategies 
duke energy closely monitors the risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and  where appropriate  uses various commodity instruments such as electricity  coal and natural gas forward contracts to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations 
duke energy s primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against exposure to the prices of power and fuel 
certain derivatives used to manage duke energy s commodity price exposure are accounted for as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
to the extent that instruments accounted for as hedges are effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact to the consolidated statements of operations until delivery or settlement occurs 
accordingly  assumptions and valuation techniques for these contracts have no impact on reported earnings prior to settlement 
several factors influence the effectiveness of a hedge contract  including the use of contracts with different commodities or unmatched terms and counterparty credit risk 
hedge effectiveness is monitored regularly and measured at least quarterly 
in addition to the hedge contracts described above and recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  duke energy enters into other contracts that qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception described in paragraph of sfas no 
 as amended and interpreted by derivatives implementation group issue c  scope exceptions normal purchases and normal sales exception for option type contracts and forward contracts in electricity  and sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
on a limited basis  us franchised electric and gas and commercial power apply the normal purchase and normal sales exception to certain contracts 
income recognition and realization related to normal purchases and normal sales contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of power 
for contracts qualifying for the scope exception  no recognition of the contract s fair value in the consolidated financial statements is required until settlement of the contract unless the contract is designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge 
recognition of the contracts in the consolidated statements of operations will be the same regardless of whether the contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges or as normal purchases and sales  unless designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge  assuming no hedge ineffectiveness 
other derivatives used to manage duke energy s commodity price exposure are either not designated as a hedge or do not qualify for hedge accounting 
derivatives related to regulated businesses reflect changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
derivatives related to unregulated businesses are marked to market each period  with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings 
these instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts see undesignated contracts below 
generation portfolio risks for duke energy is primarily exposed to market price fluctuations of wholesale power  natural gas  and coal prices in the us franchised electric and gas and commercial power segments 
duke energy optimizes the value of its bulk power marketing and non regulated generation portfolios 
the portfolios include generation assets power and capacity  fuel  and emission allowances 
the component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategies of the business units 
the generation portfolio not utilized to serve native load or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations  although the impact on the consolidated statements of operations reported earnings is partially offset by mechanisms in the regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  it was estimated that a ten percent price change per megawatt hour in forward wholesale power prices would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million in and would have had a million impact in  excluding the impact of mark to market changes on non qualifying or undesignated hedges relating to periods in excess of one year from the respective date  which are discussed further below 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  it was estimated that a ten percent change in 
table of contents part ii the forward price per ton of coal would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million in and would have had a million impact in  excluding the impact of mark to market changes on non qualifying or undesignated hedges relating to periods in excess of one year from the respective date 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  it was estimated that a ten percent price change per million british thermal mmbtu in natural gas prices would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million in and would have had a million impact in  excluding the impact of mark to market changes on undesignated hedges relating to periods in excess of one year from the respective date  which are discussed further below 
sensitivities for derivatives beyond derivative contracts executed to manage generation portfolio risks for delivery periods beyond are also exposed to changes in fair value due to market price fluctuations of wholesale power and coal 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  it was estimated that a ten percent price change in the forward price per megawatt hour of wholesale power would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million in and would have had a million impact in  resulting from the impact of mark to market changes on non qualifying and undesignated power contracts pertaining to periods in excess of one year from the respective date 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  it was estimated that a ten percent change in the forward price per ton of coal would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million in and would have had a million impact in  resulting from the impact of mark to market changes on non qualifying and undesignated coal contracts pertaining to periods in excess of one year from the respective date 
comparability of sensitivity analysis 
as commercial power began reapplying the provisions of sfas no 
on december  to portions of its operations  certain derivative contracts that historically resulted in earnings volatility receive regulatory deferral of gains and losses 
accordingly  the mark to market associated with these contracts will not impact earnings 
however  to achieve comparability of sensitivity information between periods  the portion of the derivative contracts that receive regulatory treatment have been included in the sensitivity amounts for both periods presented 
since certain derivative contracts included in the sensitivity analysis for will not result in earnings impacts  the forecasted sensitivities for are less than the pre tax income amounts disclosed above 
other commodity risks 
at december  and  pre tax income in and was not expected to be materially impacted for exposures to other commodities price changes 
the commodity price sensitivity calculations above consider existing hedge positions and estimated production levels  but do not consider other potential effects that might result from such changes in commodity prices 
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that duke energy would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations 
to reduce credit exposure  duke energy seeks to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit duke energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
duke energy attempts to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable duke energy to obtain collateral or to terminate or reset the terms of transactions after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit related events 
duke energy may  at times  use credit derivatives or other structures and techniques to provide for third party credit enhancement of duke energy s counterparties obligations 
duke energy also obtains cash or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements  where appropriate  based on its financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction 
duke energy s industry has historically operated under negotiated credit lines for physical delivery contracts 
duke energy frequently uses master collateral agreements to mitigate certain credit exposures 
the collateral agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold 
the threshold amount represents an unsecured credit limit  determined in accordance with the corporate credit policy 
collateral agreements also provide that the inability to post collateral is sufficient cause to terminate contracts and liquidate all positions 
duke energy s principal customers for power and natural gas marketing and transportation services are industrial end users  marketers  local distribution companies and utilities located throughout the us and latin america 
duke energy has concentrations of receivables from natural gas and electric utilities and their affiliates  as well as industrial customers and marketers throughout these regions 
these concentrations of customers may affect duke energy s overall credit risk in that risk factors can negatively impact the credit quality of the entire sector 
where exposed to credit risk  duke energy analyzes the counterparties financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  establishes credit limits and monitors the appropriateness of those limits on an ongoing basis 
duke energy has a third party insurance policy to cover certain losses related to duke energy carolinas asbestos related injuries and damages above an aggregate self insured retention of million 
duke energy carolinas cumulative payments began to exceed 
table of contents part ii the self insurance retention on its insurance policy during the second quarter of future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by duke energy s third party insurance carrier 
the insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is  million in excess of the self insured retention 
insurance recoveries of approximately  million and  million related to this policy are classified in the consolidated balance sheets in other within investments and other assets and receivables as of december  and  respectively 
duke energy is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims 
management believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating 
duke energy and its subsidiaries also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance guarantees  letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties 
where duke energy has issued these guarantees  it is possible that duke energy could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform 
where duke energy has issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale  duke energy attempts to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  guarantees and indemnifications  for further information on guarantees issued by duke energy or its subsidiaries 
based on duke energy s policies for managing credit risk  its exposures and its credit and other reserves  duke energy does not anticipate a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non performance by any counterparty 
interest rate risk duke energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper 
duke energy manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate exposures to a percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
duke energy also enters into financial derivative instruments  which may include instruments such as  but not limited to  interest rate swaps  swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure 
see notes    and to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  risk management and hedging activities  credit risk  and financial instruments  fair value of financial assets and liabilities  and debt and credit facilities 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december   it was estimated that if market interest rates average higher lower in than in  interest expense  net of offsetting impacts in interest income  would increase decrease by approximately million 
comparatively  based on a sensitivity analysis as of december   had interest rates averaged higher lower in than in  it was estimated that interest expense  net of offsetting impacts in interest income  would have increased decreased by approximately million 
these amounts were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable rate securities outstanding  adjusted for interest rate hedges  short term and long term investments  cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of december  and the increase in interest rate sensitivity is primarily due to borrowings outstanding under the master credit facility 
if interest rates changed significantly  management would likely take actions to manage its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in duke energy s financial structure 
equity price risk as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements  investments in debt and equity securities  duke energy invests in equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations of the business 
the vast majority of the investments in equity securities are within the nuclear decommissioning trust fund and assets of the various pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
nuclear decommissioning trust funds ndtf 
as required by the nrc and the ncuc  duke energy maintains trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning see note to the consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations 
as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities  debt securities  fixed income securities  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
per nrc and ncuc requirements  these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning 
the investments in equity securities are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets 
accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through us franchised electric and gas rates  therefore  fluctuations in equity prices do not affect duke energy s consolidated statements of operations as changes in the fair value of these investments are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to an order by the ncuc 
earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through us franchised electric and gas rates 

table of contents part ii in  the ncuc and pscsc collectively approved a million annual amount for contributions and expense levels for decommissioning 
in each of the years ended december   and  duke energy expensed approximately million and contributed cash of approximately million to the ndtf for decommissioning costs 
estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs billion in dollars  based on a decommissioning study completed in this includes costs related to duke energy s proportionate ownership in the catawba nuclear station  which was at the time the study was completed 
the other joint owners of the catawba nuclear station are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their ownership interests in the station 
as the ncuc and the pscsc require that duke energy update its cost estimate for decommissioning its nuclear plants every five years  new site specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies were completed in january that showed total estimated nuclear decommissioning costs  including the cost to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination  of approximately billion in dollars 
this estimate is based on duke energy s current ownership share of catawba nuclear station of approximately 
duke energy will file these site specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies with the ncuc and the pscsc later this year 
in addition to the decommissioning cost studies  a new funding study is underway to determine the appropriateness of the annual amounts currently being contributed to the ndtf 
the ncuc and the pscsc will consider the results of the funding study  which could potentially increase the annual required contributions to the ndtf  in the latter part of the following table provides the fair value of investments held in the ndtf at december  fair value at december  in millions equity securities corporate debt securities us government bonds municipal bonds other total pension plan assets 
duke energy maintains investments to help fund the costs of providing non contributory defined benefit retirement and other post retirement benefit plans 
those investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates 
duke energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings  which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held 
duke energy s target asset allocation for equity securities is approximately of the value of the plan assets and the holdings are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment  sector or geographic region 
a significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require duke energy to increase its funding of the pension plan in future periods  which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods 
additionally  a decline in the fair value of plan assets  absent additional cash contributions to the plan  could increase the amount of pension expense required to be recorded in future periods  which could adversely affect duke energy s results of operations in those periods 
in february  duke energy made an approximate million contribution to its pension plan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans  for additional information on pension plan assets 
foreign currency risk duke energy is exposed to foreign currency risk from investments in international affiliate businesses owned and operated in foreign countries and from certain commodity related transactions within domestic operations that are denominated in foreign currencies 
to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the us dollar and or local inflation rates  or investments may be naturally hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency 
duke energy may also use foreign currency derivatives  where possible  to manage its risk related to foreign currency fluctuations 
to monitor its currency exchange rate risks  duke energy uses sensitivity analysis  which measures the impact of devaluation of the foreign currencies to which it has exposure 
in  duke energy s primary foreign currency rate exposure is to the brazilian real 
a devaluation in the currency exchange rates as of december  in all of duke energy s exposure currencies would result in an estimated net pre tax loss on the translation of local currency earnings of approximately million to duke energy s consolidated statements of operations in the consolidated balance sheet would be negatively impacted by approximately million currency translation through the cumulative translation adjustment in aoci as of december  as a result of a devaluation in the currency exchange rates 
as of december   a devaluation in the currency exchange rates in all of duke energy s exposure currencies was expected to 
table of contents part ii result in an estimated net pre tax loss on the translation of local currency earnings of approximately million to duke energy s consolidated statements of operations and a reduction of approximately million currency translation through the cumulative translation adjustment in aoci as of december  other issues energy policy act of the energy policy act of was signed into law in august the legislation directs specified agencies to conduct a significant number of studies on various aspects of the energy industry and to implement other provisions through rulemakings 
among the key provisions  the energy policy act of repeals the puhca of  directs ferc to establish a self regulating electric reliability organization governed by an independent board with ferc oversight  extends the price anderson act for years until  provides loan guarantees  standby support and production tax credits for new nuclear reactors  gives ferc enhanced merger approval authority  provides ferc new backstop authority for the site selection of certain electric transmission projects  streamlines the processes for approval and permitting of interstate pipelines  and reforms hydropower relicensing 
in late and early  ferc initiated several rulemakings as directed by the energy policy act of duke energy is currently evaluating these proposals and does not anticipate that these rulemakings will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
global climate change 
a body of scientific evidence now accepted by a growing majority of the public and policymakers suggests that the earth s climate is changing  caused in part by greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere from human activities 
although there is still much to learn about the causes and long term effects of climate change  many  including duke energy  advocate taking steps now to begin reducing emissions with the aim of stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases at a level that avoids the potentially worst case effects of climate change 
greenhouse gas ghg emissions are produced from a wide variety of human activities 
the us epa publishes an inventory of these emissions annually 
carbon dioxide co  an essential trace gas  is a by product of fossil fuel combustion and currently accounts for about of us greenhouse gas emissions 
duke energy currently accounts for about of total us us emissions  and about of total us ghg emissions 
duke energy is making long term decisions for how best to meet its customers growing demand for electricity 
duke energy s strategy for meeting customer demand while building a sustainable business that allows our customers and our shareholders to prosper in a carbon constrained environment includes significant commitments to customer energy efficiency  renewable energy  advanced nuclear power  advanced clean coal and high efficiency natural gas electric generating plants  and retirement of older less efficient coal fired power plants 
each of these actions will or has the potential to reduce duke energy s co emissions and therefore its exposure to the costs of future ghg regulation 
duke energy s cost of complying with any federal ghg emissions law that may be enacted will depend on the design details of the program 
if potential future ghg legislation adopts a cap and trade approach  the design elements of such a program that will have the greatest influence on duke energy s compliance costs include the required levels and timing of the cap  which will drive emission allowance prices  the emission sources covered under the cap  the number of allowances that duke energy might be allocated at no cost on a year to year basis  the type and effectiveness of any cost control mechanisms included in the program  the role of emission offsets  which will also influence allowance prices  and the availability and cost of technologies that duke energy can deploy to lower its emissions 
while duke energy believes it is very likely that congress will adopt mandatory ghg emission reduction legislation at some point  the timing and design details of any such legislation are highly uncertain 
while there were many bills introduced in both houses of congress during the th congress that proposed mandatory limits on ghg emissions  s 
america s climate security act of commonly referred to as the lieberman warner bill after the sponsors senators joseph lieberman of connecticut and john warner of virginia became the primary climate change related legislative vehicle 
the bill was approved by the senate environment and public works committee in december  but failed to advance on the senate floor in june when the bill fell considerably short of the votes necessary to invoke cloture and cut off debate 
no subsequent action was taken in the th congress related to mandatory federal ghg legislation 
numerous bills mandating reductions in ghg emissions are expected to be introduced in both houses of congress in the leadership in both the house and senate has publicly stated it is their intent to proceed with climate legislation 
president obama  in his presidential campaign and after the election  indicated passage of climate change legislation is a priority 
still  as the senate debate in revealed  there are wide ranging views in congress regarding what constitutes acceptable ghg legislation 
the current condition of the us economy could add a degree of uncertainty  and there are indications that  in the th congress multiple committees will be involved in crafting ghg legislation  which will make the process of developing ghg legislation potentially more challenging 

table of contents part ii duke energy supports the enactment of federal ghg cap and trade legislation 
due to duke energy s concern about patchwork policies focused on a single industrial sector or particular region of the country  duke energy believes this legislation should establish a program that applies to all parts of the economy  including power generation  industrial and commercial sources  and motor vehicles 
to permit the economy to adjust rationally to the policy  legislation should establish a long term program that first slows the growth of emissions  stops them and then transitions to a gradually declining emissions cap as new lower and non emitting technologies are developed and become available for wide scale deployment 
legislation should also include adequate cost containment measures to protect the us economy from grave and unintended impacts of the policy 
duke energy is unable to estimate the potential cost of complying with currently unspecified and unknowable future ghg legislation or any indirect costs that might result 
compliance costs are sensitive to numerous policy design details  allowance prices  and technology availability and cost 
during the senate debate on the lieberman warner legislation in and  duke energy attempted to estimate its cost of complying with that legislation over a range of potential allowance prices 
duke energy estimated its compliance costs under the lieberman warner model to be between approximately million to billion in the first year of the program  which represented the cost to purchase emission allowances needed for compliance over and above what might be allocated to duke energy at zero cost 
duke energy would have continued to incur similar or greater annual compliance costs in subsequent years for continued allowance purchases until such time as new lower and zero emitting technologies could be deployed to reduce emissions 
duke energy s compliance costs at that time would then include the cost of purchasing and deploying new generation technologies 
duke energy would only be able to reduce its allowance purchase costs after new technologies were actually deployed 
there is no way to know how similar or different the requirements of the lieberman warner legislation might be to any future ghg legislation that congress may eventually adopt  so it is uncertain whether these costs are at all representative of compliance costs that duke energy might incur as a result of any potential future ghg legislation 
under any future scenario involving mandatory ghg limitations  duke energy would plan to seek to recover its compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms in the jurisdictions in which it operates 
at the state level  the midwestern governors association has an initiative under way called the midwestern greenhouse gas reduction accord 
one of the ongoing activities of the initiative is the design of a regional ghg cap and trade system  with the anticipated end product to be a model rule for implementing a ghg cap and trade system 
once complete  the model rule would go to participating states for their consideration and possible adoption 
the states of ohio and indiana are currently only observers to the accord process 
the outcome of this initiative is highly uncertain and duke energy is unable to determine at this time whether there might be direct or indirect cost impacts from any new regulations that might result from the initiative 
while duke energy s near term compliance strategy associated with any potential future ghg legislation that incorporates a cap and trade mechanism will likely be focused on allowance purchases  it is expected that at some point in the future duke energy would begin reducing emissions by replacing existing coal fired generation with new lower and zero emitting generation technologies  and or installing new carbon capture and sequestration technology on existing coal fired generating plants when the technologies become available and cost effective 
it is not possible at this time  however  to predict with certainty what new technologies might be developed  when they will be ready to be deployed  or what their costs will be 
there is also uncertainty as to how or when certain non technical issues  such as legal and liability questions  that could affect the cost and availability of new technologies might be resolved by regulators 
duke energy currently is focused on advanced nuclear generation  integrated gasification combined cycle generation with carbon capture and sequestration  and capture and storage retrofit technology for existing pulverized coal fired generation as promising new technologies for generating electricity with lower or no co emissions 
duke energy has begun the regulatory process to construct a new  megawatt nuclear power plant william states lee iii nuclear station in south carolina  petitioning the us nuclear regulatory commission in for a combined construction and operating license 
if constructed  this facility would produce virtually no ghg s and could begin operation in the timeframe 
with regard to advanced clean coal  duke energy is in the process of constructing a megawatt integrated gasification combined cycle igcc power plant in indiana 
one of the key features of the igcc technology is that it has great potential to support the capture of its co emissions  with subsequent underground storage of the captured co indiana s geology gives all indications of being conducive to permanent underground storage of co although the igcc plant  scheduled to be completed in  is not currently being equipped with the technology to capture carbon emissions  space is being reserved for it to be added later 
in january  duke energy was given permission by the iurc to proceed with a co capture front end engineering and design study 
duke energy has also submitted an application to the department of energy for up to a sharing of the cost of installing and operating a pilot scale co capture and storage project at duke energy s igcc facility 

table of contents part ii duke energy has regulatory requirements in north carolina and ohio to meet increasing percentages of customer demand for electricity with renewable energy 
in north carolina the requirement reaches in and in ohio it reaches a minimum of in duke energy also anticipates the congress will consider a federal renewable portfolio standard in previous attempts have passed in the house but fallen short in the senate 
duke energy believes  however  chances of passage in the th congress have increased 
in addition to relying on new technologies to reduce its co emissions  duke energy has filed for regulatory approval in each of the states in which it operates duke energy has received approval in ohio for a first of its kind innovative approach in the utility industry to help meet growing customer demand with new and creative ways to increase energy efficiency  thereby reducing demand save a watt instead of relying almost exclusively on new power plants to generate electricity 
each of these activities has the potential to reduce duke energy s future co emissions which will reduce duke energy s exposure to future ghg regulation 
duke energy recognizes the potential for more frequent and severe extreme weather events as a result of climate change and the possibility that these weather events could have a material impact on its future results of operations should these events occur 
however  the uncertain nature of potential changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency  duration  and severity and the long period of time over which any changes might take place make estimating any potential future financial risk to duke energy s operations that may be caused by the physical risks of climate change extremely challenging 
currently  duke energy plans and prepares for extreme weather events that it experiences from time to time  such as ice storms  tornados  severe thunderstorms  high winds and droughts 
duke energy s past experiences preparing for and responding to the impacts of these types of weather related events would reasonably be expected to help management plan and prepare for future climate change related severe weather events to reduce  but not eliminate  the operational  economic and financial impacts of such events

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
sfas no 

in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which amends arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas no 
clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in a consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
this statement also changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented by requiring consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
in addition  sfas no 
establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation 
for duke energy  sfas no 
is effective as of january   and must be applied prospectively  except for certain presentation and disclosure requirements which must be applied retrospectively 
the adoption of sfas no 
will impact the presentation of noncontrolling interests in duke energy s consolidated statements of operations  consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of common stockholders equity and comprehensive income  as well as the calculation of duke energy s effective tax rate

in may  the fasb issued fsp apb  which addresses the accounting for convertible debt securities that  upon conversion  may be settled by the issuer fully or partially in cash 
fsp apb does not change the accounting for more traditional types of convertible debt securities that do not have a cash settlement feature and fsp apb does not apply if  under existing gaap for derivatives  the embedded conversion feature must be accounted for separately from the rest of the instrument 
for duke energy  fsp apb is applicable as of january  and must be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented  even if the instrument has matured  has been converted  or has otherwise been extinguished as of the effective date of fsp apb duke energy is currently evaluating the impact of adopting fsp apb on its historical results of operations as  in  duke energy issued million of convertible debt with a cash settlement option that was fully converted to common stock during the years ended december   and  however  duke energy does not anticipate the retrospective application of fsp apb will have a material impact on duke energy s historical results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
future impacts of fsp apb will be determined by whether duke energy issues convertible debt with cash settlement options 
fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf 
in june  the fasb issued fsp eitf to address whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions may be participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing basic eps pursuant to the two class method described in sfas no 
the fasb concluded that rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid on unvested share based payment awards that provide a noncontingent transfer of value such as a nonforfeitable right to receive cash when dividends are paid to common stockholders  irrespective of whether the award ultimately vests to the holder of the share based payment award constitute participation rights and  therefore  should be included in the computation of basic eps using the two class method 
duke energy issues certain share based payment awards under which rights to dividends during the vesting period are nonforfeitable 
for duke energy  fsp eitf is effective as of january  and all prior period eps data is required to be adjusted retrospectively to conform to the provisions of fsp eitf duke energy is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of fsp no
