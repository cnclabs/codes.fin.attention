overview dick s is an authentic full line sporting goods retailer offering a broad assortment of brand name sporting goods equipment  apparel and footwear in a specialty store environment

on november   the company completed its acquisition of chick s sporting goods  inc the consolidated statements of operations include the results of golf galaxy and chick s for fiscal from their respective dates of acquisition 
as of january  we operated dick s stores  golf galaxy stores and chick s stores  with approximately million square feet  in states  the majority of which are located throughout the eastern half of the united states 
on september   the company s board of directors approved a two for one stock split of the company s common stock and class b common stock in the form of a stock dividend 
the split was effected by issuing our stockholders of record as of september  one additional share of common stock for every share of common stock held  and one additional share of class b common stock for every share of class b common stock held 
the applicable share and per share data for periods prior to fiscal included herein have been restated to give effect to this stock split 
the primary factors which historically influenced the company s profitability and success have been its growth in the number of stores and selling square footage  its positive comparable store sales  and its strong gross profit margins 
in the last five years  the company has grown from stores as of the end of fiscal to stores as of the end of fiscal  reflecting both organic growth and acquisitions 
the company continues to expand its presence through the opening of new stores although its rate of growth has decreased from the rate of growth experienced in earlier years reflecting the current economic conditions  lack of available real estate  the 
table of contents company s larger size  its decision to adopt more manageable store growth goals and the more recent experience of negative same store sales 
fiscal was a difficult operating environment for our industry due to numerous external factors weighing on specialty retail sales 
the pressures on the consumer have intensified as unemployment has risen  equity markets have declined  and concerns about the broader economy have grown 
these factors  combined with falling home prices and tight credit markets  suggest continued pressure on specialty retail consumers in the near term 
the company continues to see the greatest sales weakness in bigger ticket  discretionary purchases such as golf and exercise equipment  while the lodge business has benefited from higher gun and ammunition sales 
however  since the balance of macroeconomic factors that impact the company s business remains unfavorable  the company will continue to take a cautious approach to ensure that it is well positioned to capitalize on opportunities as they develop 
as a result  the company has implemented numerous strategies to help it manage through these uncertain times  including remaining focused on reducing costs  conserving cash and managing inventories in line with sales trends 
the company has trimmed planned fiscal capital expenditures to approximately million compared to million in fiscal  net of proceeds from sale leaseback transactions and allowances received from landlords 
the company believes its strong balance sheet  which includes million in cash and cash equivalents  no outstanding borrowing under its million second amended and restated credit agreement credit agreement and an inventory per square foot reduction of compared to fiscal year end  increases its financial flexibility and further strengthens its ability to successfully manage through this economic crisis 
the company expects to continue to generate positive cash flow to fund its operations and to take advantage of growth opportunities 
the company believes its existing credit agreement is sufficient to support its ongoing operations and future plans for fiscal in order to monitor the company s success  the company s senior management monitors certain key performance indicators  including comparable same store sales growth fiscal comparable store sales decreased compared to a increase in fiscal the company believes that its comparable stores sales performance was affected by numerous challenges including a difficult macroeconomic environment  declining consumer confidence resulting in lower than anticipated customer traffic and particularly cautious spending 
although the company believes it has made noticeable progress in improving its merchandise offerings  the effect of those improvements have been hampered by the macroeconomic environment 
the company s current strategy is to target a general overall trend to return to positive comparable store sales growth  although it recognizes that it continues to be affected by many of these factors 
the company believes that its ability to realize such a general overall positive trend in comparable store sales will prove to be a key factor in achieving its targeted levels of earnings per share and continuing its store expansion program to an ultimate goal of at least locations across the united states 
positive operating cash flow the company generated million of cash flow from operations in fiscal compared with million in fiscal although operating cash flow decreased in the current fiscal year compared to last year  the company believes it will generate positive operating cash flow  together with its other sources of liquidity  sufficient to fund the ongoing needs of the business 
the company believes that historically  a key strength of its business has been the ability to consistently generate positive cash flow from operations 
strong cash flow generation is critical to the future success of the company  not only to support the general operating needs of the company  but also to fund capital expenditures related to new store openings  relocations  expansions and remodels  costs associated with its corporate headquarters and its distribution centers  costs associated with continued improvement of information technology tools and costs associated with potential strategic acquisitions that may arise from time to time 
see further discussion of the company s cash flows in the liquidity and capital resources section of item herein 
quality of merchandise offerings to monitor and maintain acceptance of its merchandise offerings  the company monitors sell throughs  inventory turns  gross margins and markdown rates on a department and style level 
this analysis helps the company manage inventory receipts and markdowns to reduce cash flow requirements and deliver optimal gross margins by improving merchandise flow and establishing appropriate price points to minimize markdowns

staffing adjustments at the company s distribution centers  including the planned closure of the conklin return to vendor facility in march  have been made to reflect anticipated merchandise receipt volumes 
the company has also implemented various administrative cost reduction initiatives  including a freeze on corporate staffing levels other than those necessitated by our back office consolidation of recently acquired businesses  efforts to manage compensation related expenses and reducing travel and entertainment expenses 
capital reduction efforts the company expects to reduce is capital spending in fiscal to a projected target of million compared to million in fiscal the company plans to scale back its store expansion program to approximately stores during fiscal this level of store expansion is significantly lower than historical levels and is largely driven by the current economic conditions 
the company has created a capital appropriations committee to approve all capital expenditures in excess of certain amounts and to group and prioritize all capital projects between required  discretionary and strategic

golf galaxy is included in the company s comparable store sales calculation beginning in the second quarter of and will be included in the full year comparable store sales calculation beginning in fiscal the decrease in comparable store sales is mostly attributable to sales decreases in exercise  other footwear and golf equipment and accessories 
these sales decreases were partially offset by increases in hunting  guns and outerwear and outerwear accessories

the basis point decrease in gross profit is due primarily to a basis point increase in occupancy expenses caused by the de leverage related to the comparable store sales decline in the current year 
freight and distribution costs were consistent between years as the costs associated with the opening of a new distribution center in atlanta  georgia in the second quarter of were fully offset by initiatives to improve freight efficiencies

table of contents fiscal year ended january  february  february  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash flow from operations is seasonal in our business 
typically  we use cash flow from operations to increase inventory in advance of peak selling seasons  with the pre christmas inventory increase being the largest 
in the fourth quarter  inventory levels are reduced in connection with christmas sales and this inventory reduction  combined with proportionately higher net income  typically producing significantly positive cash flow 
cash provided by operating activities decreased by million in to million  as compared to million in fiscal the million net loss in included non cash impairment charges of million attributable to the impairment of golf galaxy s goodwill and other intangible assets and impairment charges of million in connection with certain underperforming stores

changes in assets and liabilities the primary factors contributing to the decrease in the change in assets and liabilities were the change in income taxes payable and accounts payable  partially offset by a decrease in the change in inventory 
the decrease in the change in income taxes payable was primarily due to the timing of estimated tax payments  including the larger federal extension tax payment made in fiscal relating to fiscal than in previous years 
estimated tax payments made during were significantly larger than estimated payments made during due to the impact previous stock option exercises had on reducing estimated tax payments 
the change in accounts payable and inventory is primarily due to a decrease in the procurement of merchandise in the company s planned efforts to bring inventory levels closer to the sales trends in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company believes that maintaining inventory levels in a manner consistent with sales trends will help preserve capital and stabilize gross margins in fiscal investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased by million  to million as fiscal reflected payments for the purchase of golf galaxy of million  net of million cash acquired  and chick s of million

other new business opportunities or store expansion rates substantially in excess of those presently planned may require additional funding 
the company currently anticipates receiving landlord allowances at five of its planned new stores totaling approximately million 
the amount and timing of receipt of these allowances depend  among other things  upon the timing of new store construction and the ability of landlords to satisfy their contractual obligations 
the company currently anticipates the completion of a new corporate headquarters building by january the building will be leased by the company  and the project has been financed by the developer except for any project scope changes requested by the company

in february  the company completed a private offering of million issue price of senior unsecured convertible notes due notes 
the notes accrued interest at an annual rate of of the issue price payable semi annually on august th and february th of each year until february  after february   the notes do not pay cash interest  but instead the initial principal amount of the notes will accrete daily at an original issue discount rate of per year  until maturity on february  the maturity date  when a holder would receive  per note 
the holders of the notes had the right the put right to cause the company to purchase all or a portion of the notes held by them in cash at a price of per  of principal amount at maturity  plus per  of principal amount at maturity cash interest accrued the purchase price on february  the purchase date 
holders choosing to exercise the put right were required to deliver to the company a notice of purchase by the close of business on february  as of the purchase date  the company s payment obligation with respect to those notes that were submitted for purchase by the company totaled  or  of principal amount at maturity  which  including interest paid on the notes that were not put for payment was paid by the company on february  the remaining amount of notes outstanding following february  was  represented as the accreted principal amount as of february  or  of principal amount at maturity 
the remaining outstanding notes will mature by their terms on the maturity date  unless earlier redeemed  converted or put to the company 
the company issued a redemption notice in march and currently anticipates redeeming the remaining notes on march   at a redemption price equal to the sum of the issue price  accreted original issue discount and accrued cash interest  if any 
holders of the notes that remain outstanding have the ability at any time to convert the notes in accordance with and the terms and formulas described  including the period after the notes have been called for redemption by the company 
concurrently with the sale of the notes in  the company purchased a bond hedge designed to mitigate the potential dilution to stockholders from the conversion of the notes and sold a warrant exercisable for shares of the company s common stock to the counterparty with whom the company entered into the bond hedge 
the net effect of the bond hedge and the warrant was to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes if the company elected a net share settlement upon a conversion event 
by their terms the warrant and bond hedge expired on february  and no longer have the ability to be exercised 
as such  the mitigation protection against potential dilution that the company had upon a conversion event is no longer available 
based on the current price of the company s common stock and the number of notes remaining outstanding  the company believes conversion of the remaining notes would not have a dilutive effect on the company s estimated outstanding number of shares as a result of the notes 
the company used availability under its credit agreement to fund the amounts due as a result of the put rights and believes that it will have adequate sources of liquidity to fund any redemption or conversion of the remaining notes outstanding

newly issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r significantly changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of contingent consideration  preacquisition contingencies  transaction costs  in process research and development and restructuring costs 
in addition  under sfas r  changes in an acquired entity s deferred tax assets and uncertain 
table of contents tax positions after the measurement period will impact income tax expense 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas r beginning in the first quarter of fiscal this standard will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis  including the treatment of any income tax adjustments related to past acquisitions 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements  however  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
the requirements of sfas are first effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
however  in february the fasb decided that an entity need not apply this standard to nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities until the subsequent year 
accordingly  our adoption of sfas was limited to financial assets and liabilities 
the adoption of sfas no 
for financial assets and financial liabilities did not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
the adoption of sfas no 
in for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities is also not expected to have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp no 
fas 
fsp no 
fas requires companies estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset to consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements or  in the absence of historical experience  to consider assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension as adjusted for entity specific factors 
fsp no 
fas is effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of fsp no 
fas on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued fsp no 
apb accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlements fsp apb  which will change the accounting treatment for convertible securities which the issuer may settle fully or partially in cash 
under the final fsp  cash settled convertible securities will be separated into their debt and equity components 
the value assigned to the debt component will be the estimated fair value  as of the issuance date  of a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature  and the difference between the proceeds for the convertible debt and the amount reflected as a debt liability will be recorded as additional paid in capital 
as a result  the debt will be recorded at a discount reflecting its below market coupon interest rate 
the debt will subsequently be accreted to its par value over its expected life  with the rate of interest that reflects the market rate at issuance being reflected on the income statement 
this change in methodology will affect the calculations of net income and earnings per share for many issuers of cash settled convertible securities 
the fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and requires retrospective application 
although fsp apb will not impact the company s actual past or future cash flows  the company expects the impact to pre tax non cash interest expense for fiscal   and to be approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the company does not expect adoption of the fsp to have a material impact on the company s results in fiscal critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
critical accounting policies are those that the company believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require the company s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation the company values inventory using the lower of weighted average cost or market method 
market price is generally based on the current selling price of the merchandise 
the company regularly reviews inventories to determine if the carrying value of the inventory exceeds market value and the company records a reserve to reduce the carrying value to its market price  as necessary 
historically  the company has rarely experienced significant occurrences of obsolescence or slow moving inventory 
however  future changes  such as customer merchandise preference  unseasonable weather patterns  economic conditions or business trends could cause the company s 
table of contents inventory to be exposed to obsolescence or slow moving merchandise 
shrink expense is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical shrink trends 
the company performs physical inventories at the stores and distribution centers throughout the year 
the reserve for shrink represents an estimate for shrink for each of the company s locations since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date 
estimates by location and in the aggregate are impacted by internal and external factors and may vary significantly from actual results 
vendor allowances vendor allowances include allowances  rebates and cooperative advertising funds received from vendors 
these funds are determined for each fiscal year and the majority are based on various quantitative contract terms 
amounts expected to be received from vendors relating to the purchase of merchandise inventories are treated as a reduction of inventory and reduce cost of goods sold as the merchandise is sold 
amounts that represent a reimbursement of costs incurred  such as advertising  are recorded as a reduction to the related expense in the period that the related expense is incurred 
the company records an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest projected purchase volumes and advertising forecasts 
on an annual basis at the end of the year  the company confirms earned allowances with vendors to ensure the amounts are recorded in accordance with the terms of the contract 
business combinations in accounting for business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
the determination of fair value involves the use of estimates and assumptions which we believe provides a reasonable basis for determining fair value 
accordingly  we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of inventory  identifiable intangible assets such as trade names  and any other significant assets or liabilities 
we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation  as necessary  up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill  indefinite lived and other finite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if the company deems it necessary 
our evaluation for impairment requires accounting judgments and financial estimates in determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
if these judgments or estimates change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step impairment test 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company determines the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow and a market value approach 
the company s estimates may differ from actual results due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to its business models  or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially affect the company s future financial results 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then the company must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the activities in the second step include valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the impaired reporting unit based on their fair value and determining the fair value of the impaired reporting unit s goodwill based upon the residual of the summed identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
intangible assets that have been determined to have indefinite lives are also not subject to amortization and are reviewed at least annually for potential impairment  as mentioned above 
the fair value of the company s intangible assets are estimated and compared to their carrying value 
the company estimates the fair value of these intangible assets based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method 
this methodology assumes that  in lieu of ownership  a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets 
this approach is dependent on a number of factors  including estimates of future growth and trends  royalty rates in the category of intellectual property  discount rates and other variables 
the company recognizes an impairment charge when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets and closed store reserves the company reviews long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified  which is the store level 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by the company with respect to future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
based on an analysis of current and future store performance  management periodically evaluates the need to close underperforming stores 
reserves are established when the company ceases to use the location for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income  as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
if the timing or amount of actual sublease income differs from estimated amounts  this could result in an increase or decrease in the related reserves 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain losses related to health  workers compensation and general liability insurance  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our liability exposure 
liabilities associated with these losses are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  industry factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
uncertain tax positions we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s net exposure to interest rate risk will consist primarily of borrowings under the credit agreement 
the company s credit agreement bears interest at rates that are benchmarked either to us short term floating rate interest rates or one month libor rates  at the company s election 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement as of january  and february  the impact on the company s annual net income of a hypothetical one percentage point interest rate change on the average outstanding balances under the credit agreement would be approximately million based upon fiscal average borrowings 
credit risk in february  the company sold million issue price of senior unsecured convertible notes due in conjunction with the issuance of these notes  we also entered into a five year convertible bond hedge and a five year separate warrant transaction with one of the initial purchasers the counterparty and or certain of its affiliates 
subject to the movement in our common stock price  we were exposed to credit risk arising out of net settlement of the convertible bond hedge and separate warrant transaction in our favor 
the company repaid 
table of contents substantially all of the notes on february  impact of inflation the company does not believe that operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance  however  that operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
tax matters presently  the company does not believe that there are any tax matters that could materially affect the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
significant portions of the company s net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the company s fiscal year  which is due  in part  to the holiday selling season and  in part  to our sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel 
any decrease in fiscal fourth quarter sales  whether because of a slow holiday selling season  unseasonable weather conditions  or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year
