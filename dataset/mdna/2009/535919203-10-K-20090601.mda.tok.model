critical accounting policies the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
as described more fully below  these estimates bear the risk of change due to the inherent uncertainty attached to the estimate 
for example  accounting for films and television programs requires us to estimate future revenue and expense amounts which  due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates  are likely to differ to some extent from actual results 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
accounting for films and television programs 
we capitalize costs of production and acquisition  including financing costs and production overhead  to investment in films and television programs 
these costs are amortized to direct operating expenses in accordance with statement of position  accounting by producers or distributors of films sop 
these costs are stated at the lower of unamortized films or television program costs or estimated fair value 
these costs for an individual film or television program are amortized and participation and residual costs are accrued in the proportion that current year s revenues bear to management s estimates of the ultimate revenue at the beginning of the year expected to be recognized from exploitation  exhibition or sale of such film or television program over a period not to exceed ten years from the date of initial release 
for previously released film or television programs acquired as part of a library  ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed years from the date of acquisition 
we regularly review and revise  when necessary  our ultimate revenue and cost estimates  which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and or write down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the film or television program to our estimated fair value 
we estimate the ultimate revenue based on experience with similar titles or title genre  the general public appeal of the cast  actual performance when available at the box office or in markets currently being 
table of contents exploited  and other factors such as the quality and acceptance of motion pictures or programs that our competitors release into the marketplace at or near the same time  critical reviews  general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors  many of which we do not control and which may change 
in the normal course of our business  some films and titles are more successful than anticipated and some are less successful 
accordingly  we update our estimates of ultimate revenue and participation costs based upon the actual results achieved or new information as to anticipated revenue performance such as for home entertainment revenues initial orders and demand from retail stores when it becomes available 
an increase in the ultimate revenue will generally result in a lower amortization rate while a decrease in the ultimate revenue will generally result in a higher amortization rate and periodically results in an impairment requiring a write down of the film cost to the title s fair value 
these write downs are included in amortization expense within direct operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale or licensing of films and television programs is recognized upon meeting all recognition requirements of sop revenue from the theatrical release of feature films is recognized at the time of exhibition based on our participation in box office receipts 
revenue from the sale of dvds blu ray discs in the retail market  net of an allowance for estimated returns and other allowances  is recognized on the later of receipt by the customer or street date when it is available for sale by the customer 
under revenue sharing arrangements  rental revenue is recognized when we are entitled to receipts and such receipts are determinable 
revenues from television licensing are recognized when the feature film or television program is available to the licensee for telecast 
for television licenses that include separate availability windows during the license period  revenue is allocated over the windows 
revenue from sales to international territories are recognized when access to the feature film or television program has been granted or delivery has occurred  as required under the sales contract  and the right to exploit the feature film or television program has commenced 
for multiple media rights contracts with a fee for a single film or television program where the contract provides for media holdbacks defined as contractual media release restrictions  the fee is allocated to the various media based on our assessment of the relative fair value of the rights to exploit each media and is recognized as each holdback is released 
for multiple title contracts with a fee  the fee is allocated on a title by title basis  based on our assessment of the relative fair value of each title 
distribution revenue from the distribution of tv guide network programming distributors generally pay a per subscriber fee for the right to distribute programming is recognized in the month the services are provided 
advertising revenue is recognized when the advertising spot is broadcast or displayed online 
advertising revenue is recorded net of agency commissions and discounts 
cash payments received are recorded as deferred revenue until all the conditions of revenue recognition have been met 
long term  non interest bearing receivables are discounted to present value 
reserves 
revenues are recorded net of estimated returns and other allowances 
we estimate reserves for dvd blu ray returns based on previous returns and our estimated expected future returns related to current period sales on a title by title basis in each of the dvd blu ray businesses 
factors affecting actual returns include  among other factors  limited retail shelf space at various times of the year  success of advertising or other sales promotions  and the near term release of competing titles 
we believe that our estimates have been materially accurate in the past  however  due to the judgment involved in establishing reserves  we may have adjustments to our historical estimates in the future 
we estimate provisions for accounts receivable based on historical experience and relevant facts and information regarding the collectability of the accounts receivable 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgments and estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for our larger customers and an analysis of the length of time receivables have been past due 
the financial condition of a given customer and its ability to pay may change over time and could result in an increase or decrease to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which  when the impact of such change is material  is disclosed in our discussion on direct operating expenses elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes 
we are subject to federal and state income taxes in the us  and in several foreign jurisdictions 
we account for income taxes according to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not or a valuation allowance is applied 
because of our historical operating losses  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
when we have a history of profitable operations sufficient to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized  the valuation allowance will be reversed 
however  this assessment of our planned use of our deferred tax assets is an estimate which could change in the future depending upon the generation of taxable income in amounts sufficient to realize our deferred tax assets 

table of contents goodwill 
goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment within each fiscal year or between the annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
we perform our annual impairment test as of december in each fiscal year 
we performed our last annual impairment test on our goodwill as of december  no goodwill impairment was identified in any of our reporting units 
determining the fair value of reporting units requires various assumptions and estimates 
the estimates of fair value include consideration of the future projected operating results and cash flows of the reporting unit 
such projections could be different than actual results 
should actual results be significantly less than estimates  the value of our goodwill could be impaired in the future 
business acquisitions 
we account for each of our business acquisitions as a purchase  whereby the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value 
the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair value of the net identifiable assets is allocated to goodwill 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities requires various assumptions and estimates 
these estimates and assumptions are refined with adjustments recorded to goodwill as information is gathered and final appraisals are completed over the allocation period allowed under sfas no 
 business combinations 
the changes in these estimates could impact the amount of assets  including goodwill and liabilities  ultimately recorded in our balance sheets and could impact our operating results subsequent to such acquisition 
we believe that our estimates have been materially accurate in the past
