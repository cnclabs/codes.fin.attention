our actual results may differ materially 
overview neuralstem is focused on the development and commercialization of treatments based on transplanting human neural stem cells 
we have developed and maintain a portfolio of patents and patent applications that form the proprietary base for our research and development efforts in the area of neural stem cell research 
we own or exclusively license four issued patents and twelve patent pending applications in the field of regenerative medicine and related technologies 
we believe our technology base  in combination with our know how  and collaborative projects with major research institutions provides a competitive advantage and will facilitate the successful development and commercialization of products for use in the treatment of a wide array of neurodegenerative conditions and in regenerative repair of acute disease 
regenerative medicine is a young and emerging field 
there can be no assurances that our intellectual property portfolio will ultimately produce viable commercialized products and processes 
even if we are able to produce a commercially viable product  there are strong competitors in this field and our product may not be able to successfully compete against them 
all of our research efforts to date are at the pre clinical stage of development 
we are focused on leveraging our key assets  including our intellectual property  our scientific team  our facilities and our capital  to accelerate the advancement of our stem cell technologies 
in addition  we are pursuing strategic collaborations with members of academia 
we are headquartered in rockville  maryland 
in addition to our core tissue based technology we have begun developing a small molecule compound 
the company has performed preliminary in vitro and in vivo tests on the compound with regard to neurogenesis 
based on the results of these tests we have applied for a us patent on the compound 
technology our technology is the ability to isolate human neural stem cells from most areas of the developing human brain and spinal cord and our technology includes the ability to grow them into physiologically relevant human neurons of all types 
our two issued core patents entitled i isolation  propagation  and directed differentiation of stem cell from embryonic and adult central nervous system of mammals  and ii in vitro generation of differentiated neurons from cultures of mammalian multi potential cns stem cell contain claims which cover the process of deriving the cells and the cells created from such process 
what differentiates our stem cell technology from others is that our patented processes do not require us to push the cells towards a certain fate by adding specific growth factors 
our cells actually become the type of cell they are fated to be 
we believe this process and the resulting cells create a technology platform that allows for the efficient isolation and ability to produce  in commercially reasonable quantities  neural stem cells from the human brain and spinal cord 
our technology allows for cells to grow in cultured dishes  also known as in vitro growth  without mutations or other adverse events that would compromise their usefulness 
research we have devoted substantial resources to our research programs in order to isolate and develop a series of neural stem cell banks that we believe can serve as a basis for therapeutic products 
our efforts to date have been directed at methods to identify  isolate and culture large varieties of stem cells of the human nervous system  and to develop therapies utilizing these stem cells 
this research is conducted both internally and through the use of third party laboratory consulting companies under our direct supervision 
trends outlook revenue our revenue was previously derived primarily from grant reimbursements and licensing fees 
as our focus is now on pre clinical work in anticipation of entering clinical trials in  we are not concentrated on increasing revenue 
long term  we anticipate that our revenue will be derived primarily from licensing fees and the sale of our cell therapy products 
at present  we are in our pre clinical stage of development and as a result  we cannot accurately predict when or if we will be able to produce a product for commercialization 
accordingly  we cannot accurately estimate if our when we will begin generating revenue from such sources 
research development expense our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with pre clinical research  exclusively in the field of human neural stem cell therapies and regenerative medicine  related to our clinical cell therapy candidates 
these expenses represent both pre clinical development costs and costs associated with non clinical support activities such as quality control and regulatory processes 
the cost of our research and development personnel is the most significant category of expense 
however  we also incur expenses with third parties  including license agreements  third party contract services  sponsored research programs and consulting expenses 
we do not segregate research and development costs by project because our research is focused exclusively on human stem cell therapies as a unitary field of study 
although we have different areas of focus for our research  these areas are completely intertwined and have not yet matured to the point where they are separate and distinct projects 
the intellectual property  scientists and other resources dedicated to these efforts are not separately allocated to individual projects  but rather are conducting our research on an integrated basis 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we add personnel  expand our pre clinical research animal surgeries  manufacturing of cells  and in vitro characterization of cells which includes testing and cell quality control  begin clinical trial activities  increase our regulatory compliance capabilities  and ultimately begin manufacturing 
in we retained quintiles  inc to assist with regulatory compliance  preparation of our first investigational new drug ind application  and patient enrollment for our first human trial 
while recruitment for the trial cannot commence until we have received an fda approved protocol  much of the infrastructure required must be developed and in place well in advance 
for instance  we can begin to identify  contact  and educate prospective patients as well as the treatment community prior to commencing these trials 
the amount of monetary increases stemming from increased personnel and expenses as we move from pre clinical to clinical state is difficult to predict due to the uncertainty inherent in the timing and extent of progress in our research programs  and initiation of clinical trials 
in addition  the results from our basic research and pre clinical trials  as well as the results of trials of similar therapeutics underdevelopment by others  will influence the number  size and duration of planned and unplanned trials 
as our research efforts mature  we will continue to review the direction of our research based on an assessment of the value of possible commercial applications emerging from these efforts 
based on this continuing review  we expect to establish discrete research programs and evaluate the cost and potential for cash inflows from commercializing products  partnering with others in the biotechnology industry  or licensing the technologies associated with these programs to third parties 
on december  we filed our ind with the fda to begin a clinical trial to treat als or lou gehrig s disease 
on february   the fda provided us with specific comments  questions and recommendations for modification to the protocol submitted in our ind 
the trial is on clinical hold 
we are in the process of analyzing the notice and the fda s comments and recommendations 
we believe that it is not possible at this stage to provide a meaningful estimate of the total cost to complete our ongoing projects  including clinical trials  and bring any proposed products to market 
the use of human stem cells as a therapy is an emerging area of medicine  and it is not known what clinical trials will be required by the fda in order to gain marketing approval 
the costs to complete such clinical trials could vary substantially depending upon the projects selected for development  the number of clinical trials required and the number of patients needed for each study 
at a minimum  we estimate that a trial for an individual indication such as als will require at least to patients at an estimated cost of  per patient 
it is possible that the completion of these studies could be delayed for a variety of reasons  including difficulties in enrolling patients  delays in manufacturing  incomplete or inconsistent data from the pre clinical or clinical trials  and difficulties evaluating the trial results 
any delay in completion of a trial would increase the cost of that trial  which would harm our operating results 
due to these uncertainties  we cannot reasonably estimate the size  nature  nor timing of the costs to complete  or the amount or timing of the net cash inflows from our current activities 
until we obtain further relevant pre clinical and clinical data  we will not be able to estimate our future expenses related to these programs or when  if ever  and to what extent  we will receive cash inflows from resulting products 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative g a expenses consist of the general costs  expenses and salaries for the operation and maintenance of our business 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase as we progress from pre clinical to a clinical phase 
we anticipate g a expenses related to our core business will increase at a slower rate than that of similar companies making such transition due in large part to our outsourcing model 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note of the notes to financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements use of estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and  accordingly  require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  our management has estimated the expected economic life and value of our licensed technology  our net operating loss for tax purposes and our stock option and warrant expenses related to compensation to employees and directors  consultants and investment banks 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition our revenues  to date  has been derived primarily from providing treated samples for gene expression data from stem cell experiments and from providing services as a subcontractor under federal grant programs 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of goods and services has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
intangible and long lived assets we follow sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of disposal of long lived assets  which established a primary asset approach to determine the cash flow estimation period for a group of assets and liabilities that represents the unit of accounting for a long lived asset to be held and used 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
during the period ended december  no impairment losses were recognized 
research and development costs research and development costs consist of expenditures for the research and development of patents and technology  which are not capitalizable and charged to operations when incurred 
our research and development costs consist mainly of payroll and payroll related expenses  research supplies and costs incurred in connection with specific research grants 
stock based compensation the company accounts for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of the equity instrument is recorded on the earlier of the performance commitment date or the date the services required are completed 
beginning in  we adopted sfas no 
r share based payment which superseded apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
we recognized  and  in stock based compensation expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
results of operations our results of operations have varied significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and may vary significantly in the future due to the occurrence of material recurring and nonrecurring events

liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through the private placement of our securities  the exercise of investor warrants  and to a lesser degree from grants 
our currently monthly cash burn rate is  in the next several months we expect the monthly burn rate to drop below  we anticipate that our available cash and expected income will be sufficient to finance most of our current activities for at least the next months from december   although certain activities and related personnel may need to be reduced 
on december   we filed our first ind with the fda 
in the event the fda approves our ind  we expect additional costs related to the trial this year of about  assuming approval of the ind  we estimate that we will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to finance our current operations  pre clinical and clinical work for at least months from december  we cannot assure you that public or private financing or grants will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
several factors will affect our ability to raise additional funding  including  but not limited to  the volatility of our common shares and general market conditions 
change in versus at december cash and cash equivalents year ended december net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities total cash and cash equivalents was  at december   compared with  at december  the decrease in our cash and cash equivalents of  or  from december  to december  was a consequence of the ramp up of our operations activity to complete our ind applications net cash used in operating activities in our operating activities we used  in cash in and  in cash in the increase of  in cash used in operating activities in as compared to was primarily attributable to a consequence of the ramp up of our operations activity to complete our ind applications 
net cash used in investing activities in our investment activities we used  in cash in and  in cash in the decrease from to of  for net cash used in investing activities was due to a decrease in our investment in property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  in as compared to  in listed below are key financing transactions entered into by us in the last two years 
also  please refer to the section of this annual report entitled recent sale of unregistered securities for a further description of the following transactions in march of we completed the private placement of  of our units consisting of i one share of common stock  and ii one half class c warrant 
the units were priced at 
in october of warrant holders holding approximately  of our class c warrants exercised their warrants 
as an inducement for the exercise  we issued those warrant holders who exercised their warrants a replacement class c warrant 
in february of  we sold a strategic purchaser  of our common stock 
on december   we sold  of common stock pursuant to our shelf registration statement on form s we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows since inception 
we have not achieved profitability and may not be able to realize sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we do not expect to be profitable in the next several years  but rather expect to incur additional operating losses 
we have limited liquidity and capital resources and must obtain significant additional capital resources in order to sustain our product development efforts  for acquisition of technologies and intellectual property rights  for preclinical and clinical testing of our anticipated products  pursuit of regulatory approvals  acquisition of capital equipment  laboratory and office facilities  establishment of production capabilities  for general and administrative expenses and other working capital requirements 
we rely on cash balances and the proceeds from the offering of our securities  exercise of outstanding warrants and grants to fund our operations 
we intend to pursue opportunities to obtain additional financing in the future through the sale of our securities and grants 
we have a shelf registration statement which was declared effective on september  and covers up to approximately  of our securities that could be available for financings 
on december   we filed a prospectus supplement announcing that we entered into a securities purchase agreement under which we sold  of common shares pursuant to such shelf registration 
accordingly  we may issue an additional  pursuant to the shelf registration statement 
the source  timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions  interest rates and  more specifically  on our progress in our exploratory  preclinical and future clinical development programs 
funding may not be available when needed at all  or on terms acceptable to us 
lack of necessary funds may require us  among other things  to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs  planned clinical trials  and or our capital expenditures or to license our potential products or technologies to third parties
