overview we are a provider of innovative medical devices used in minimally invasive  image guided procedures to treat peripheral vascular disease  or pvd  and local oncology therapy options for treating cancer  including radiofrequency ablation rf or rfa systems  irreversible electroporation ire surgical resection systems and embolization products for treating benign and malignant tumors 
we design  develop  manufacture and market a broad line of therapeutic and diagnostic devices that enable interventional physicians interventional radiologists  vascular surgeons  interventional and surgical oncologists and others to treat pvd  tumors  and other non coronary diseases 
historically  we reported our results of operations as a single segment 
beginning with fiscal  we have organized our business into three reportable segments peripheral vascular  access and oncology surgery 
the peripheral vascular segment is comprised of the venous  angiographic  pta  drainage and thrombolytic product lines 
the access segment is comprised of the dialysis  port and picc product lines 
the oncology surgery segment is comprised of the rfa  embolization  habib and nanoknife product lines 
prior periods have been recast for net sales and gross profit for this new reporting structure 
for the past five fiscal years  over of our net sales were from single use  disposable products 
the following table sets forth our aggregate net sales from the following product categories for our last three fiscal years net sales of net sales net sales of net sales net sales of net sales dollars in thousands peripheral vascular access oncology surgery total we sell our broad line of quality devices in the united states through a direct sales force and outside the us through a combination of direct sales and distributor relationships 
as of may   our sales organization numbered in the us and outside the us for fiscal years  and  net sales in non u 
s markets were   and respectively 
the increase in our net sales outside the us is primarily as a result of the diomed acquisition completed in june and the rita acquisition completed in january our growth depends in large part on the continuous introduction of new and innovative products  together with ongoing enhancements to our existing products  through internal product development  technology licensing and strategic alliances 
we recognize the importance of  and intend to continue to make investments in  research and development 
for fiscal  and  our research and development r d expenditures were million  million  and million  respectively  and constituted   and  
table of contents respectively  of net sales 
a significant portion of our r d expenses in related to a million charge for in process r d from our acquisition of rita 
excluding this charge  our r d expenses were approximately of net sales in r d activities include research  product development  intellectual property affairs and regulatory affairs 
r d expenditures for ire projects totaled million in  or of net sales 
we expect that our r d expenditures will be approximately of net sales in fiscal primarily due to investment in ire technology and remain in the range of to of net sales thereafter 
however  downturns in our business could cause us to reduce our r d spending 
we are also seeking to grow through selective acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
in january  we acquired rita medical systems  inc this acquisition created a diversified medical technology company with a broad line of access  diagnostic and therapeutic products that enable interventional physicians and surgeons to treat peripheral vascular disease and cancerous tumors 
interventional oncology is a large and growing area for our existing customer base and rita s leadership position  premium products and excellent reputation fit our strategy 
rita had a very strong position in vascular access ports  which are an ideal sales fit with our morpheus ct picc 
in addition  in may we acquired irreversible electroporation ire technology which will be complementary to rita s diverse offering of local oncology therapies  including its market leading rfa systems  habib sealer tm resection devices and lc beads tm for tumor embolization 
we are in the process of commercializing the ire technology and recently introduced the nanoknife generator 
in june  we completed the acquisition of certain us and us assets of diomed  inc with this acquisition  we substantially strengthened our position in the market for the treatment of varicose veins 
the combination of diomed endovenous laser products with our existing venous product line provides us with a comprehensive venous product offering 
in january  we completed the acquisition of certain assets of flowmedica  inc providing us with the benephit product line  a therapeutic approach to deliver drugs directly to the kidneys in order to prevent and treat acute kidney injury  in the emerging field of targeted renal therapy 
except to the extent we can further use our equity securities as acquisition capital  we will require additional equity or debt financing to fund any future significant acquisitions 
for fiscal  approximately of our product sales were derived from products manufactured for us by third parties  compared to for fiscal we intend to manufacture more products in house to lower product costs and increase profitability 
in and  we expanded our manufacturing facility in queensbury  new york  to provide us with additional manufacturing capacity and to accommodate additional research  development and administrative requirements 
in july  we entered into an agreement to lease a  square foot office building in latham  new york that will house our corporate headquarters and certain business operations 
the building will be constructed by a commercial real estate developer with a targeted occupancy date of march our ability to increase our profitability will depend in large part on improving gross profit margins 
factors such as changes in our product mix  new technologies and unforeseen price pressures may cause our margins to grow at a slower rate than we have anticipated or to decline 
recent developments ceo transition on january   we entered into an employment agreement and non statutory stock option agreement with our then chief executive officer that provided  among other things  for a transition to a new chief executive officer 
the transition to the new chief executive was completed in the third quarter of fiscal the former chief executive officer did not have an operating role after february  accordingly  we recorded a provision in fiscal of approximately million in general and administrative expenses for all current and future costs associated with the aforementioned employment agreement and non statutory stock option agreement and certain costs associated with the recruitment of a new chief executive officer 
the new ceo commenced employment with us in march 
table of contents acquisition of flowmedica  inc on january   we completed the acquisition of certain assets of flowmedica  inc for approximately million in cash and a contingent payment based on fiscal sales of flowmedica products 
with this acquisition  we purchased the benephit product line  a therapeutic approach to deliver drugs directly to the kidneys in order to prevent and treat acute kidney injury  in the emerging field of targeted renal therapy 
intangible assets acquired totaled approximately million which have been identified as product technologies year weighted average useful life 
inventory acquired totaled approximately  the acquisition is being accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  we have included the results of operations in the financial statements effective january   the date of acquisition 
the pro forma effects of the acquisition were not material to our income statement and balance sheet 
ten employees of flowmedica  inc became employees upon completion of the acquisition 
acquisition of certain assets of diomed on june   we completed the acquisition of certain us assets of diomed  inc and uk assets of diomed uk limited  in separate transactions  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in cash including capitalized acquisition costs 
with this acquisition  we substantially strengthened our position in the market for the treatment of varicose veins 
the combination of diomed endovenous laser products with our existing venous product line provides us with a comprehensive venous product offering 
the total of the net tangible assets acquired was million 
goodwill recorded as a result of these acquisitions was approximately million 
intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  totaled approximately million of which million has been identified as customer relationships year estimated weighted average useful life and  has been identified as product technologies year estimated weighted average useful life 
the acquisition is being accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  we have included the results of operations in the financial statements effective june   the date of acquisition 
the pro forma effects of the diomed acquisition on our income statement and balance sheet were not material 
thirty five employees of diomed became employees of ours upon completion of the acquisition 
acquisition of oncobionic  inc on may   we completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of oncobionic  inc pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement entered into on october  the closing of the acquisition came as a result of the successful use of irreversible electroporation ire technology in the first human clinical trial for the treatment of soft tissue  conducted during the first week of april under the october stock purchase agreement  we agreed to pay a total purchase price of million  including  of assumed liabilities 
we made payments of million upon the execution of the stock purchase agreement in october  million on may  upon the closing of the acquisition  and million in november the remaining million is payable in november the stock purchase agreement also provides for future royalty payments due on net sales of any catheter based products sold by us that incorporate irreversible electroporation technology ire 
we hold a license to such technology under a license agreement with the regents of the university of california the uc license 
acquisition of rita medical systems  inc on january   we completed the acquisition of rita for a total purchase price of approximately million  comprised of approximately million in cash  million shares of common stock  and assumption of outstanding rita options and other convertible securities  which were exercisable for an additional million shares of our common stock at the time of acquisition 

table of contents rita s operating results were consolidated with those of angiodynamics beginning on the date of the acquisition  january  since our results are not restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of rita  fluctuations in our operating results for as compared to the and period are significantly impacted by the acquisition of rita 
we acquired rita for its market position  premium product offerings  developed and emerging technologies in the fields of interventional oncology and vascular access and its highly skilled workforce 
the merger was pursued and completed because the management groups and stockholders of angiodynamics and rita believed the combined entity would achieve higher sales and profitability than either or both of the pre merger companies on a standalone basis 
company reorganization historically  we reported our results of operations as a single segment 
beginning with fiscal  we have organized our business into three reportable segments peripheral vascular  access and oncology surgery 
the peripheral vascular segment is comprised of the venous  angiographic  pta  drainage and thrombolytic product lines 
the access segment is comprised of the dialysis  port and picc product lines 
the oncology surgery segment is comprised of the rfa  embolization  habib and nanoknife product lines 
prior periods have been recast for net sales and gross profit for this new reporting structure 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
while all these significant accounting policies affect the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require us to use a greater degree of judgment and or estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectibility is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
decisions relative to criterion iii regarding collectibility are based upon our judgments  as discussed under accounts receivable below  and should conditions change in the future and cause us to determine this criterion is not met  our results of operations may be affected 
we recognize revenue  net of sales taxes assessed by any governmental authority  as products are shipped  based on fob shipping point terms when title and risk of loss passes to customers 
we negotiate shipping and credit terms on a customer by customer basis and products are shipped at an agreed upon price 
all product returns must be pre approved by us and customers may be subject to a restocking charge 
to be accepted  a returned product must be unadulterated  undamaged and have at least months remaining prior to its expiration date 
accounts receivable accounts receivable  principally trade  are generally due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor aging reports  collections and payments from customers  and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we identify 
while such credit losses have historically 
table of contents been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
we write off accounts receivable when they are determined to be uncollectible 
for fiscal years   and  our write offs of accounts receivable have been insignificant 
income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we calculate income tax expense for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this involves estimating actual current taxes due plus assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment for tax and accounting purposes that are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we periodically evaluate deferred tax assets  capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to determine their recoverability based primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income and capital gains 
where their recovery is not likely  we estimate a valuation allowance and record a corresponding additional tax expense in our statement of operations 
if actual results differ from our estimates due to changes in assumptions  the provision for income taxes could be materially affected 
as of may   our valuation allowance and net deferred tax asset were approximately million and million  respectively 
the deferred tax asset includes million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards remaining from the rita acquisition 
these losses could be significantly limited under internal revenue code irc section our analysis of rita s ownership changes as defined in irc section shows that approximately million of remaining federal net operating losses and million of remaining state net operating losses will expire prior to utilization 
the gross deferred tax asset related to the net operating losses reflects this limitation 
we need to generate approximately million of taxable income in each year over the next seventeen years to ensure the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we have determined that we have sufficient existing levels of pre tax earnings to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet 
in order to support the realizability of our net deferred tax asset  we projected our pre tax income utilizing a combination of historical and projected results 
utilizing this projected pre tax income  we have projected taxable income taking into consideration existing levels of permanent differences including stock option exercise deductions and non deductible expenses and the reversal of significant temporary differences 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards as of may  after considering irc section limitations are million 
the expiration of the federal net operating loss carryforwards are as follows million between and  million between and and million between and our state net operating loss carryforwards as of may  after considering remaining irc section limitations are million which expire in various years from to in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas no 
r  transition election to accounting for the tax effect of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r 
under the modified prospective transition method  no adjustment is made to the deferred tax balances associated with stock based payments that continue to be classified as equity awards 
additionally  we elected to use the long form method  as provided in paragraph of sfas no 
r to determine the pool of windfall tax benefits 
the long form method requires us to analyze the book and tax compensation for each award separately as if it had been issued following the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 subject to adjustments for net operating loss carryforwards 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which 
table of contents clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation requires us to recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we adopted this statement on june  there was no cumulative effect of adopting fin upon adoption  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was zero 
during the twelve months ended may   we did not recognize any tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within our global operations as a component of income tax expense 
this accounting policy did not change as a result of the adoption of fin accrued interest and penalties recognized in the consolidated balance sheet were as of may  and may  we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world 
the internal revenue service irs completed an examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years and in february which did not result in a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
fiscal years through remain open to examination by the various tax authorities 
we analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income taxes  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions and believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and we do not anticipate any adjustments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
management does not anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost at standard cost which approximates the first in  first out method or market 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast  which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
as of may   may   and june   our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was   and  respectively 
property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at cost  less accumulated depreciation  and depreciate these assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we determine this based on our estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue 
we evaluate these assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
any change in condition that would cause us to change our estimate of the useful lives of a group or class of assets may significantly affect depreciation expense on a prospective basis 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range between three and nineteen years  on either a straight line basis over the expected period of benefit or as revenues are earned from the sales of the related products 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets and review such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
our determination of impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows 
if an intangible asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of the impairment will equal the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
for goodwill  the evaluation requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
if the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is reduced to its implied fair value through an adjustment to the goodwill balance  resulting in an impairment charge 
our determination of impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows 
we will test goodwill for impairment during the third quarter of every fiscal year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment exists 
events that could  in the future  result in impairment include  but are not limited to  sharply declining sales for a significant product or in a significant geographic region 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination 
beginning in fiscal we began reporting three operating segments 
the reporting units are consistent with our operating segments  and include peripheral vascular  access and oncology surgery 
as a result  the carrying value of goodwill was allocated to each of the reporting units on a relative fair value basis 
we completed our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit as of december  our assessment of goodwill impairment indicated that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value and therefore goodwill in each of the reporting units was not impaired 
the fair value of peripheral vascular  access and oncology surgery exceeded its carrying value by  and  respectively 
the sum of the fair values of the reporting units was reconciled to our current market capitalization based upon our stock price plus an estimated control premium of approximately as of december  to determine fair value  we utilized two market based approaches and an income approach 
under the market based approaches  we utilized information regarding our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples 
under the income approach  we determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
we determined the discounted cash flow as the best indicator to determine fair value 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates  operating margins  discount rates and future market conditions  among others 
solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the fair value calculations  we assumed that the current economic conditions would continue through fiscal year  followed by a recovery period in fiscal years and in addition  we applied gross margin assumptions consistent with our company s historical trends at various revenue levels and used a ebitda exit multiple of  and to calculate the terminal value of the peripheral vascular  access and oncology surgery reporting units  respectively  compared to an ebitda exit multiple of used in the prior year 
in addition  we used a discount rate of  and to calculate the fair value of the peripheral vascular  access and oncology surgery reporting units  respectively 
this discount rate is higher than the discount rate used in the prior year  primarily due to the fact that additional risk premiums were added to take into account the economic downturn and specific inherent risks associated with each reporting unit 

table of contents since early november  our stock market capitalization has generally been lower than our shareholders equity or book value 
however  our reporting units have continued to generate significant cash flow from their operations  and we expect that they will continue to do so in and beyond 
furthermore  given the relatively small difference between our stock price and our book value per share  we believe that a reasonable potential buyer would offer a control premium for our business that would adequately cover the difference between our trading prices and our book value 
even though we determined that there was no goodwill impairment as of december   the future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment  such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a material negative change in relationships with significant customers  strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions  loss of key personnel or a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of  would require an interim assessment for some or all of the reporting units prior to the next required annual assessment as of december  it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
stock based compensation on june   the effective date we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to our stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method  which is a method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
in accordance with this method of adoption  prior period results of operations and financial position have not been restated to reflect the impact of stock based compensation 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for options using the intrinsic value method under the guidance of apb no 
 and provided pro forma disclosure as allowed by statement no 
for  stock based compensation was million pre tax million after tax  or per diluted share and million pre tax million after tax  or per diluted share in under the provisions of sfas r  we expect to recognize the following future expense for awards granted prior to may  unrecognized compensation cost weighted average remaining vesting period in years stock options non vested stock awards unrecognized compensation cost for stock options is presented net of assumed annual forfeitures 
we recognize compensation expense for our stock awards issued subsequent to the adoption of sfas r on a straight line basis over the substantive vesting period 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we allocated the pro forma compensation expense for stock options over the vesting period using straight line 
table of contents attribution method 
we will continue to amortize compensation expense related to stock options granted prior to the adoption of sfas r using a straight line attribution method 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized is based on the value of the portion of awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we currently expect  based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  that approximately of our options will vest annually  and we have therefore applied a annual forfeiture rate in determining the stock based compensation charge recorded 
we will re evaluate this estimate periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate on a prospective basis as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that actually vest 
for the fiscal years ended may   may  and june   we used the black scholes option pricing model black scholes as our method of valuation under sfas r and a single option award approach 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
black scholes was also previously used for our pro forma information required by sfas for periods prior to june  the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of the grant as determined by the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as other assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  and a risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on factual data derived from public sources 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
prior to fiscal  due to our limited public history  we considered historical volatility and trends within our industry peer group when estimating expected stock price volatility 
beginning with fiscal  we began to utilize our historical volatility when estimating expected stock price volatility 
we use yield rates on us treasury securities for a period approximating the expected term of the award to estimate the risk free interest rate 
the expected term is determined using the simplified method available under sab due to our limited public history 
the dividend yield is based on the history and expectation of dividend payments 
we have not paid dividends in the past nor do we expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
our historical data includes information from may   the date of our initial public offering

the transition to the new chief executive was completed in the third quarter of fiscal and the former chief executive officer has not had an operating role with the company since february  accordingly  we recorded a provision in fiscal of approximately million in our general and administrative expenses for all current and future costs associated with the aforementioned employment agreement and non statutory stock option agreement and certain costs associated with the recruitment of our new chief executive officer 
at may   approximately million of related ceo transition costs was included in accrued liabilities 
the results also include approximately  for the write off of architectural  design and planning costs associated with a project to build an office facility in queensbury  new york

a significant amount of the expenses we incurred in related to the acquisition of rita and were outside the normal course of our operations as a stand alone company 
as required under the rules of purchase accounting  these expenses included an in process r d charge of million that carries with it no income tax benefit  amortization expense of million on the fair value of the acquired intangible assets and million

the cash benefit amounted to approximately million  million and million for the years ended may   may  and june   respectively 
according to the rules of purchase accounting  we are unable to use acquired nols to offset our provision for income taxes in the statements of operations 
fiscal years ended may  and may  net sales 
net sales are derived from the sale of our products and related freight charges  less discounts and returns 
net sales for fiscal increased by  or million  to million  from million in fiscal million of the million was attributable to increased sales of laser ablation products  including those acquired from diomed 
the balance of the growth in net sales was primarily attributable to increased unit sales of lc bead and the smartport ct 
from a business unit perspective  peripheral vascular sales increased to million from million 
million of the increase was attributable to increased sales of laser ablation products  including those acquired from diomed 
laser ablation sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting the acquisition of diomed and the integration of the venacure evlt product line 
access sales were million  an increase of  primarily attributable to increased unit sales of smartport ct 
oncology surgery sales were million  an increase of over the prior year primarily as a result of strong sales of our embolization product  lc bead 
from a geographical perspective  us sales increased million or in fiscal to million from million a year ago 
approximately million of this increase was attributable to increased sales of laser ablation products  including those acquired from diomed 
the balance of this increase was primarily attributable to increased unit sales of lc bead and the smartport ct 
international sales increased million or in fiscal to million from million a year ago 
approximately million of this increase was attributable to the sales of products acquired from diomed  offset by decreased sales of our angiographic catheters  pta products and rf ablation devices 
ire products nanoknife contributed approximately  in in the international oncology surgery business segment sales 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of goods sold  which includes the costs of materials  products purchased from third parties and sold by us  manufacturing personnel  royalties  freight  business insurance  depreciation of property and equipment and other manufacturing overhead 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal and fiscal our gross profit improved on peripheral vascular products reflecting the manufacture of lasers as a result of the diomed acquisition and declined on oncology surgery products due to increased sales of the lower margin lc bead product 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses include costs to develop new products  enhance existing products  validate new and enhanced products and register  and maintain and defend our intellectual property 
r d expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to increased engineering personnel and other costs to support ire development and commercialization activities 
r d expenditures for the ire program totaled million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses were for fiscal  compared with for the same prior year period 
at may   we employed people in research  development  intellectual property and regulatory activities compared with people a year ago 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing s m expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  travel and entertainment  attendance at medical society meetings  product promotions and samples

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on investments and financing that could impact our results of operations and financial position 
although we have entered into interest rate swaps with a bank to limit our exposure to interest rate change on our variable interest rate financings  we do not currently engage in any other hedging or market risk management tools 
at may   we maintained variable interest rate financing of million in connection with our facility expansions 
we have limited our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements with a bank under which we agreed to pay the bank fixed annual interest rate of and and the bank assumed our variable interest payment obligations under the financing 
nearly all of our sales have historically been denominated in united states dollars 
although not significant  in late fiscal we began to make sales in other currencies  particularly the euro  gb pound and canadian dollar 
approximately of our sales in the fiscal were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro and gb pound 
we currently have no significant direct foreign currency exchange risk and such risk in the future is expected to be modest 
our excess cash is invested in highly liquid  short term  investment grade securities with maturities primarily of less than two years 
these investments are not held for speculative or trading purposes 
changes in interest rates may affect the investment income we earn on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and therefore affect our cash flows and results of operations 
we hold investments in auction rate securities ars in order to generate higher than typical money market investments 
ars typically are high credit quality  generally achieved with municipal bond insurance 
credit risks are eased by the historical track record of bond insurers  which back a majority of this market 
sell orders for any security traded through an auction process could exceed bids 
such instances are usually the result of a drastic deterioration of issuer credit quality 
should there be a failed auction  we may be unable to liquidate our position in the securities in the near term 
we have million in investments in two auction rate securities issued by new york state and local government authorities that have failed auctions 
the authorities are current in their interest payments on the securities 
we are party to legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business as described in note q
