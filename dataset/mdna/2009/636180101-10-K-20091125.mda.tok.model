the information in md a should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements in item of this report 
for the year ended september  compared to the year ended september   the company experienced a decrease in earnings of million  primarily due to lower earnings in the exploration and production segment 
the earnings decrease was driven largely by an impairment charge of million million after tax recorded in the exploration and production segment  along with reduced crude oil and natural gas prices 
in the company s exploration and production segment  oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development costs are capitalized under the full cost method of accounting 
such costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule that determines a limit  or ceiling  on the amount of property acquisition  exploration and development costs that can be capitalized 
at december   due to significant declines in crude oil and natural gas commodity prices cushing  oklahoma west texas intermediate oil reported spot price of per bbl at december  versus a reported price of per bbl at september   henry hub natural gas reported spot price of per mmbtu at december  versus a reported price of per mmbtu at september   the book value of the company s oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling  resulting in the impairment charge mentioned above 
note because actual pricing of the company s various producing properties varies depending on their location  the actual various prices received for such production is utilized to calculate the ceiling  rather than the cushing oil and henry hub prices  which are only indicative of current prices 
at september   the quoted cushing  oklahoma spot price for west texas intermediate oil was per bbl per bbl at june  and per bbl at march  and the quoted spot price for natural gas was per mmbtu per mmbtu at june  and per mmbtu at march  
at september   the ceiling exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million and approximately million and million at june  and march   respectively 
if natural gas prices used in the ceiling test calculation at september  had been per mmbtu lower  the ceiling would have exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
if crude oil prices used in the ceiling test calculation at september  had been per bbl lower  the ceiling would have exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
if both natural gas and crude oil prices used in the ceiling test calculation at september  were lower by per mmbtu and per bbl  respectively  the ceiling would have exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
these calculated amounts are based solely on price changes and do not take into account any other changes to the ceiling test calculation 
despite the decrease in earnings discussed above  the company s balance sheet consisted of a capitalization structure of equity and debt at september  with its april issuance of million of notes due in may  management believes that it has enhanced its liquidity position at a time when there is still uncertainty in the credit markets 
at september   the company did not have any short term borrowings outstanding 
however  the company continues to maintain a number of individual uncommitted or discretionary lines of credit with financial institutions for general corporate purposes 
these credit lines  which aggregate to million  are revocable at the option of the financial institutions and are reviewed on an annual basis 
the company anticipates that these lines of credit will continue to be renewed  or replaced by similar lines 
the total amount available to be issued under the company s commercial paper program is million 
the commercial paper program is backed by a syndicated committed credit facility totaling million  which commitment extends through september  
table of contents the company s liquidity position will become increasingly important over the next three years 
the company anticipates spending million for capital expenditures in in addition  the company has identified possible additional projects where capital expenditures could amount to million in and million in the majority of these expenditures have been targeted for the exploration and production segment  where the company anticipates spending million in million in appalachia 
depending on drilling success in  commodity pricing  and  subject to approval of the company s board of directors  spending could reach million in million in appalachia  and million in million in appalachia 
the significant rise in estimated capital expenditures in the exploration and production segment  specifically in the appalachian region  can be attributed to a strong emphasis on developing natural gas properties in the marcellus shale 
the emphasis on marcellus shale development will carry over into the pipeline and storage segment  which is anticipating the need for additional pipeline and storage capacity as marcellus shale production comes on line 
pipeline and storage segment capital expenditures are anticipated to be million in  with opportunities to spend up to million in and million in  depending on market acceptance of the proposed projects  contractual commitments from shippers  and approval from the company s board of directors 
the projects being considered in the pipeline and storage segment are discussed in detail in the investing cash flow section of the capital resources and liquidity section that follows 
the company anticipates financing these capital expenditures with cash from operations  short term borrowings and long term debt 
critical accounting estimates the company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those estimates whereby judgments or uncertainties could affect the application of accounting policies and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to item at note a summary of significant accounting policies 
oil and gas exploration and development costs 
in the company s exploration and production segment  oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development costs are capitalized under the full cost method of accounting 
under this accounting methodology  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized  including internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the internal costs that are capitalized do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities 
the company does not recognize any gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to a cost center 
the company believes that determining the amount of the company s proved reserves is a critical accounting estimate 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of reserves that  based on geologic and engineering data  appear with reasonable certainty to be producible under existing economic and operating conditions 
such estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and may be subject to substantial revisions as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
the estimates involved in determining proved reserves are critical accounting estimates because they serve as the basis over which capitalized costs are depleted under the full cost method of accounting on a units of production basis 
unproved properties are excluded from the depletion calculation until proved reserves are found or it is determined that the unproved properties are impaired 
all costs related to unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the pool of capitalized costs being amortized 

table of contents in addition to depletion under the units of production method  proved reserves are a major component in the sec full cost ceiling test 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test  which is performed each quarter  determines a limit  or ceiling  on the amount of property acquisition  exploration and development costs that can be capitalized 
the ceiling under this test represents a the present value of estimated future net cash flows  excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet  using a discount factor of  which is computed by applying current market prices of oil and gas as adjusted for hedging to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet  less estimated future expenditures  plus b the cost of unevaluated properties not being depleted  less c income tax effects related to the differences between the book and tax basis of the properties 
the estimates of future production and future expenditures are based on internal budgets that reflect planned production from current wells and expenditures necessary to sustain such future production 
the amount of the ceiling can fluctuate significantly from period to period because of additions to or subtractions from proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
the ceiling is then compared to the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes 
if the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred taxes exceeds the ceiling at the end of any fiscal quarter  a non cash impairment must be recorded to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value 
this non cash impairment cannot be reversed at a later date if the ceiling increases 
it should also be noted that a non cash impairment to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value in any given period causes a reduction in future depletion expense 
at september   the ceiling exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
because of declines in commodity prices subsequent to september   the book value of the company s oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling at december  the quoted cushing  oklahoma spot price for west texas intermediate oil had declined from a reported price of per bbl at september  to a reported price of per bbl at december  the quoted henry hub spot price for natural gas had declined from a reported price of per mmbtu at september  to a reported price of per mmbtu at december  consequently  the company recorded an impairment charge of million million after tax during the quarter ended december  note because actual pricing of the company s various producing properties varies depending on their location  the actual various prices received for such production is utilized to calculate the ceiling  rather than the cushing oil and henry hub prices  which are only indicative of current prices 
at september   the quoted cushing  oklahoma spot price for west texas intermediate oil was per bbl per bbl at june  and per bbl at march  and the quoted spot price for natural gas was per mmbtu per mmbtu at june  and per mmbtu at march  
at september   the ceiling exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million and approximately million and million at june  and march   respectively 
if natural gas prices used in the ceiling test calculation at september  had been per mmbtu lower  the ceiling would have exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
if crude oil prices used in the ceiling test calculation at september  had been per bbl lower  the ceiling would have exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
if both natural gas and crude oil prices used in the ceiling test calculation at september  were lower by per mmbtu and per bbl  respectively  the ceiling would have exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
these calculated amounts are based solely on price changes and do not take into account any other changes to the ceiling test calculation 
it is difficult to predict what factors could lead to future impairments under the sec s full cost ceiling test 
as discussed above  fluctuations in or subtractions from proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices have an impact on the amount of the ceiling at any point in time 
in accordance with the current authoritative guidance for asset retirement obligations  the company records an asset retirement obligation for plugging and abandonment costs associated with the exploration and production segment s crude oil and natural gas wells and capitalizes such costs in property  plant and equipment ie the full cost pool 
under the current authoritative guidance for asset retirement obligations  since plugging and abandonment costs are already included in the full cost pool  the units of production depletion calculation 
table of contents excludes from the depletion base any estimate of future plugging and abandonment costs that are already recorded in the full cost pool 
as discussed above  the full cost method of accounting provides a ceiling to the amount of costs that can be capitalized in the full cost pool 
in accordance with current authoritative guidance  since the full cost pool includes an amount associated with plugging and abandoning the wells  as discussed in the preceding paragraph  the calculation of the full cost ceiling no longer reduces the future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves by an estimate of plugging and abandonment costs 
regulation 
the company is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
the company  in its utility and pipeline and storage segments  has accounting policies which conform to the fasb authoritative guidance regarding accounting for certain types of regulations  and which are in accordance with the accounting requirements and ratemaking practices of the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows the company to defer expenses and income on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the ratesetting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then flowed through the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in rates 
management s assessment of the probability of recovery or pass through of regulatory assets and liabilities requires judgment and interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders 
if  for any reason  the company ceases to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of its operations  the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be eliminated from the balance sheet and included in the income statement for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
such amounts would be classified as an extraordinary item 
for further discussion of the company s regulatory assets and liabilities  refer to item at note c regulatory matters 
accounting for derivative financial instruments 
the company  in its exploration and production segment  energy marketing segment  and pipeline and storage segment  uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil 
these instruments are categorized as price swap agreements and futures contracts 
the company  in its pipeline and storage segment  previously used an interest rate collar to limit interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate debt 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company accounted for these instruments as effective cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
in  the company discontinued hedge accounting for the interest rate collar  which resulted in a gain being recognized 
gains or losses associated with the derivative financial instruments are matched with gains or losses resulting from the underlying physical transaction that is being hedged 
to the extent that the derivative financial instruments would ever be deemed to be ineffective based on the effectiveness testing  mark to market gains or losses from the derivative financial instruments would be recognized in the income statement without regard to an underlying physical transaction 
the company uses both exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative financial instruments 
the company adopted the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements during the quarter ended december  as such  the fair value of such derivative financial instruments is determined under the provisions of this guidance 
the fair value of exchange traded derivative financial instruments is determined from level inputs  which are quoted prices in active markets 
the company determines the fair value of non exchange traded derivative financial instruments based on an internal model  which uses both observable and unobservable inputs other than quoted prices 
these inputs are considered level or level inputs 
all derivative financial instrument assets and liabilities are evaluated for the probability of default by either the counterparty or the company 
credit reserves are applied against the fair values of such assets or liabilities 
refer to the market risk sensitive instruments section below for further discussion of the company s derivative financial instruments 
pension and other post retirement benefits 
the amounts reported in the company s financial statements related to its pension and other post retirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis  which uses many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts 
these assumptions include the discount rate  the expected 
table of contents return on plan assets  the rate of compensation increase and  for other post retirement benefits  the expected annual rate of increase in per capita cost of covered medical and prescription benefits 
the company utilizes a yield curve model to determine the discount rate 
the yield curve is a spot rate yield curve that provides a zero coupon interest rate for each year into the future 
each year s anticipated benefit payments are discounted at the associated spot interest rate back to the measurement date 
the discount rate is then determined based on the spot interest rate that results in the same present value when applied to the same anticipated benefit payments 
the expected return on plan assets assumption used by the company reflects the anticipated long term rate of return on the plan s current and future assets 
the company utilizes historical investment data  projected capital market conditions  and the plan s target asset class and investment manager allocations to set the assumption regarding the expected return on plan assets 
changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experience  including deviations between actual versus expected return on plan assets  could have a material impact on the amount of pension and post retirement benefit costs and funding requirements experienced by the company 
however  the company expects to recover substantially all of its net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit costs attributable to employees in its utility and pipeline and storage segments in accordance with the applicable regulatory commission authorization 
for financial reporting purposes  the difference between the amounts of pension cost and post retirement benefit cost recoverable in rates and the amounts of such costs as determined under applicable accounting principles is recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability  as appropriate  as discussed above under regulation 
pension and post retirement benefit costs for the utility and pipeline and storage segments  as determined under the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits  represented of the company s total pension and post retirement benefit costs for the years ended september  and changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experience could also have an impact on the benefit obligation and the funded status related to the company s pension and other post retirement benefits and could impact the company s equity 
for example  the discount rate was changed from in to in the change in the discount rate from to increased the retirement plan projected benefit obligation by million and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million 
other examples include actual versus expected return on plan assets  which has an impact on the funded status of the plans  and actual versus expected benefit payments  which has an impact on the pension plan projected benefit obligation and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation 
for  actual versus expected return on plan assets resulted in a decrease to the funded status of the retirement plan million and the veba trusts and h accounts million 
the actual versus expected benefit payments for caused a decrease of million to the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation 
in calculating the projected benefit obligation for the retirement plan and the accumulated post retirement obligation  the actuary takes into account the average remaining service life of active participants 
the average remaining service life of active participants is years for the retirement plan and years for those eligible for other post retirement benefits 
for further discussion of the company s pension and other post retirement benefits  refer to other matters in this item  which includes a discussion of funding for the current year and the adoption of fasb revised accounting guidance for defined benefit pensions and other postretirement plans  and to item at note h retirement plan and other post retirement benefits 

table of contents results of operations earnings compared with the company s earnings were million in compared with earnings of million in the decrease in earnings of million is primarily the result of lower earnings in the exploration and production  pipeline and storage and utility segments and the all other category  slightly offset by a lower loss in the corporate category and higher earnings in the energy marketing segment  as shown in the table below 
in the discussion that follows  note that all amounts used in the earnings discussions are after tax amounts  unless otherwise noted 
earnings were impacted by several events in and  including events a non cash million impairment charge million after tax recorded during the quarter ended december  for the exploration and production segment s oil and gas producing properties  a million impairment in the value of certain landfill gas assets in the all other category  a million impairment in the value of the company s investment in esne recorded in the all other category  a limited liability company that owns an megawatt  combined cycle  natural gas fired power plant in the town of north east  pennsylvania  and a million death benefit gain on life insurance policies recognized in the corporate category

the company s earnings from continuing operations were million in compared with million in the company s earnings from discontinued operations were million in the increase in earnings from continuing operations is primarily the result of higher earnings in the exploration and production and utility segments and the all other category  slightly offset by lower earnings in the corporate category and the pipeline and storage and energy marketing segments  as shown in the table below 
earnings from continuing operations and discontinued operations were impacted by the event discussed above and the following events events a million gain on the sale of seci  which was completed in august this amount is included in earnings from discontinued operations  a million benefit to earnings in the pipeline and storage segment due to the reversal of a reserve established for all costs incurred related to the empire connector project recognized during june a million benefit to earnings in the pipeline and storage segment associated with the discontinuance of hedge accounting for empire s interest rate collar  and a million benefit to earnings in the energy marketing segment related to the resolution of a purchased gas contingency

the decrease in retail gas sales revenues of million was largely a function of the recovery of lower gas costs subject to certain timing variations  gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues 
the recovery of lower gas costs resulted from a much lower cost of purchased gas 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
the decrease in transportation revenues of million was primarily due to a bcf decrease in transportation throughput  largely the result of customer conservation efforts and the poor economy 
in the new york jurisdiction  the nypsc issued an order providing for an annual rate increase of million beginning december  as part of this rate order  a rate design change was adopted that shifts a greater amount of cost recovery into the minimum bill amount  thus spreading the recovery of such costs more evenly throughout the year 
as a result of this rate order  retail and transportation revenues for were million lower than revenues for the utility segment had off system sales revenues of million and million for and  respectively 
due to profit sharing with retail customers  the margins resulting from off system sales are minimal and there was not a material impact to margins in and the decrease in off system sales revenue stems from order no 
final rule  which was issued by the ferc on october  the final rule seemingly held that a local distribution company making off system sales on unaffiliated pipelines would be engaging in marketing that would require compliance with the ferc s standards of conduct 
accordingly  pending clarification of this issue from the ferc  as of november   distribution corporation ceased off system sales activities 
on october   the ferc released order no 
a  which clarified that a local distribution company making off system sales of gas that has been transported on non affiliated pipelines is not subject to the standards of conduct 
in light of and in reliance on this clarification  distribution corporation determined that it may resume engaging in off system sales on non affiliated pipelines 
such off system sales resumed in november the decrease in other operating revenues of million is largely related to amounts recorded in pursuant to rate settlements approved by the nypsc 
in accordance with these settlements  distribution corporation was allowed to utilize certain refunds from upstream pipeline companies and certain other credits referred to as the cost mitigation reserve to offset certain specific expense items 
in  distribution corporation utilized million of the cost mitigation reserve  which increased other operating revenues  to recover previous undercollections of pension expenses 
in  distribution corporation utilized only million of the cost mitigation reserve 
the impact of this million decrease in other operating revenues was offset by an equal decrease to operation and maintenance expense thus there is no earnings impact 

table of contents compared with operating revenues for the utility segment increased million in compared with this increase largely resulted from a million increase in off system sales revenue see discussion below  a million increase in retail gas sales revenues  an million increase in transportation revenues  and a million increase in other operating revenues 
the increase in retail gas sales revenues for the utility segment was largely a function of the recovery of higher gas costs subject to certain timing variations  gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues  which more than offset the revenue impact of lower retail sales volumes  as shown in the table above 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
this change was also affected by a base rate increase in the pennsylvania jurisdiction effective january that increased operating revenues by million for the increase is included within both retail and transportation revenues in the table above 
in the new york jurisdiction  the nypsc issued an order providing for an annual rate increase of million beginning december  as part of this rate order  a rate design change was adopted that shifts a greater amount of cost recovery into the minimum bill amount  thus spreading the recovery of such costs more evenly throughout the year 
this rate design change resulted in lower retail and transportation revenues exclusive of the impact of higher gas costs during the winter months compared to the prior year and higher retail and transportation revenues in the spring and summer months compared to the prior year 
on a cumulative basis for  the impact of this rate order has been to lower operating revenues by million 
the increase in transportation revenues was also due to a bcf increase in transportation throughput  largely the result of the migration of customers from retail sales to transportation service 
on november  the us court of appeals vacated and remanded the ferc s order no 
regarding affiliate standards of conduct  with respect to natural gas pipelines 
the court s decision became effective on january   and on january   the ferc issued order no 
 its interim rule  designed to respond to the court s decision 
in order no 
 as clarified by the ferc on march   the ferc readopted  on an interim basis  certain provisions that existed prior to the issuance of order no 
that had made it possible for the utility segment to engage in certain off system sales without triggering the adverse consequences that would otherwise arise under the order no 
standards of conduct 
as a result  the utility segment resumed engaging in off system sales on non affiliated pipelines as of may  resulting in total off system sales revenues of million and million for and  respectively 
due to profit sharing with retail customers  the margins resulting from off system sales are minimal and there was not a material impact to margins in and the increase in other operating revenues of million is largely related to amounts recorded pursuant to rate settlements approved by the nypsc 
in accordance with these settlements  distribution corporation was allowed to utilize certain refunds from upstream pipeline companies and certain other credits referred to as the cost mitigation reserve to offset certain specific expense items 
in  distribution corporation utilized million of the cost mitigation reserve  which increased other operating revenues  to recover previous undercollections of pension expenses 
the impact of that increase in other operating revenues was offset by an equal amount of operation and maintenance expense thus there is no earnings impact 
purchased gas the cost of purchased gas is the company s single largest operating expense 
annual variations in purchased gas costs are attributed directly to changes in gas sales volumes  the price of gas purchased and the operation of purchased gas adjustment clauses 
currently  distribution corporation has contracted for long term firm transportation capacity with supply corporation  empire and six other upstream pipeline companies  for long term gas supplies with a combination of producers and marketers  and for storage service with supply corporation and three nonaffiliated companies 
in addition  distribution corporation satisfies a portion of its gas requirements through spot market purchases 
changes in wellhead prices have a direct impact on the cost of purchased gas 
distribution corporation s average cost of purchased gas  including the cost of transportation and storage  was per mcf in  a 
table of contents decrease of from the average cost of per mcf in the average cost of purchased gas in was higher than the average cost of per mcf in additional discussion of the utility segment s gas purchases appears under the heading sources and availability of raw materials in item earnings compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in in the new york jurisdiction  earnings decreased by million 
this was primarily due to an increase in interest expense million stemming from the borrowing by the new york jurisdiction of distribution corporation of a portion of the company s april debt issuance 
the april debt was issued at a significantly higher interest rate than the interest rates on debt that had matured in march the negative earnings impact of the december  rate order discussed above million and routine regulatory adjustments million also contributed to the decrease 
the decrease was partially offset by a million overall reduction in operating expenses mostly other post retirement benefits and pension expense 
in the pennsylvania jurisdiction  earnings increased by million 
this was primarily due to the positive earnings impact of colder weather million  routine regulatory adjustments million and lower operating expenses million 
a decrease in normalized usage per account million  a higher effective tax rate million and an increase in interest expense million partially offset these increases 
the phrase usage per account refers to the average gas consumption per customer account after factoring out any impact that weather may have had on consumption 
the impact of weather on the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction is tempered by a weather normalization clause wnc 
the wnc  which covers the eight month period from october through may  has had a stabilizing effect on earnings for the new york rate jurisdiction 
in addition  in periods of colder than normal weather  the wnc benefits the utility segment s new york customers 
for  the wnc reduced earnings by approximately million  as the weather was colder than normal 
for  the wnc preserved earnings of approximately million  as the weather was warmer than normal 
compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in in the new york jurisdiction  earnings increased by million 
this was primarily due to a million overall decrease in operating expenses mostly other post retirement benefits and bad debt expense  higher non cash interest income on a pension related regulatory asset million  a decrease in property  franchise  and other taxes million  a decrease in depreciation expense million  lower income tax expense million  lower interest expense million  and increased usage per account million 
the impact of these items more than offset lower base rates due to the rate design change described above million  and routine regulatory adjustments that reduced earnings by million 
in the pennsylvania jurisdiction  earnings increased by million 
this was primarily due to a base rate increase million that became effective january  an increase in normalized usage million  a decrease in bad debt expense million  and a decrease in property  franchise  and other taxes million 
warmer weather million partially offset these increases 
the impact of weather on the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction is tempered by a wnc 
the wnc  which covers the eight month period from october through may  has had a stabilizing effect on earnings for the new york rate jurisdiction 
in addition  in periods of colder than normal weather  the wnc benefits the utility segment s new york customers 
in and  the wnc preserved earnings of approximately million and million  respectively  as the weather was warmer than normal 

table of contents pipeline and storage revenues pipeline and storage operating revenues year ended september thousands firm transportation interruptible transportation firm storage service interruptible storage service other pipeline and storage throughput mmcf year ended september firm transportation interruptible transportation compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment increased million in as compared with the increase was primarily due to a million increase in transportation revenue primarily due to higher revenues from the empire connector and new contracts for transportation service 
partially offsetting this increase  efficiency gas revenues decreased million reported as a part of other revenue in the table above 
the majority of this decrease was due to significantly lower gas prices in as compared to under supply corporation s tariff with suppliers  supply corporation is allowed to retain a set percentage of shipper supplied gas to cover compressor fuel costs and other operational purposes 
to the extent that supply corporation does not need all of the gas to cover such operational needs  it is allowed to keep the excess gas as inventory 
that inventory is later sold to customers 
the excess gas that is retained as inventory represents efficiency gas revenue to supply corporation 
compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment increased million in as compared with the majority of the increase was the result of increased transportation revenues million due to the fact that the pipeline and storage segment was able to renew existing contracts at higher rates due to favorable market conditions for transportation service associated with storage 
in addition  there were increased efficiency gas revenues million primarily due to higher gas prices in the current year 
earnings compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the decrease was primarily due to the earnings impact 
table of contents associated with a decrease in efficiency gas revenues million  as discussed above 
in addition  higher interest expense million  higher depreciation expense million  and a decrease in the allowance for funds used during construction million also contributed to the decrease in earnings 
the increase in interest expense can be attributed to higher debt balances and a higher average interest rate on borrowings 
the increase in the average interest rate stems from the borrowing of a portion of the company s april debt issuance 
the increase in depreciation expense can be attributed primarily to a revision of accumulated depreciation combined with the increased depreciation associated with placing the empire connector in service in december the decease in the allowance for funds used during construction was due to completion of the empire connector project in december whereas the allowance for funds used during construction related to the empire connector project was recorded throughout  it was only recorded for three months in these earnings decreases were partially offset by the earnings impact associated with higher transportation revenues million  as discussed above 
compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the main factors contributing to this decrease were higher operation and maintenance expenses million  primarily caused by the non recurrence in of a reversal of a reserve for preliminary survey costs related to the empire connector project during million 
in addition  there was a million positive earnings impact during associated with the discontinuance of hedge accounting for empire s interest rate collar that did not recur during  and the pipeline and storage segment experienced higher interest costs million 
these earnings decreases were offset by the earnings impact associated with higher transportation revenues million  an increase in the allowance for funds used during construction million and the earnings impact associated with higher efficiency gas revenues million

compared with operating revenues from continuing operations for the exploration and production segment decreased million in as compared with gas production revenue after hedging from continuing operations decreased million primarily due to a per mcf decrease in weighted average prices after hedging 
gas production from continuing operations was virtually flat with the prior year as production 
table of contents decreases in the gulf coast region were substantially offset by production increases in the appalachian region 
the decrease in gas production from continuing operations that occurred in the gulf coast region  mmcf was a result of lingering shut ins caused by hurricanes edouard  gustav and ike in september while seneca s properties sustained only superficial damage from the hurricanes  two significant producing properties were shut in for a significant portion of the current fiscal year due to repair work on third party pipelines and onshore processing facilities 
one of the properties was back on line by march  and the other property was back on line by the end of april the increase in gas production from continuing operations in the appalachian region of  mmcf resulted from additional wells drilled throughout fiscal that came on line in oil production revenue after hedging from continuing operations decreased million due to a per barrel decrease in weighted average prices after hedging  which more than offset an increase in oil production from continuing operations of  barrels primarily from the west coast and gulf coast regions 
in addition  there was a million decrease in gross processing plant revenues from continuing operations net of eliminations due to a reduction in the commodity prices of residual gas and liquids sold at seneca s processing plants in the west coast and appalachian regions

compared with operating revenues from continuing operations for the exploration and production segment increased million in as compared with oil production revenue after hedging from continuing operations increased million due primarily to a per barrel increase in weighted average prices after hedging  which more than offset a decrease in oil production of  barrels 
gas production revenue after hedging from continuing operations increased million due to a per mcf increase in weighted average prices after hedging and a  mmcf increase in production from continuing operations 
the increase in gas production from continuing operations occurred primarily in the appalachian region  mmcf  consistent with increased drilling activity in the region 
the gulf coast region also contributed significantly to the increase in natural gas production from continuing operations mmcf 
production from new fields in primarily in the high island area outpaced declines in production from some existing fields  period to period 
production in this region would have been higher if not for the hurricane activity during the month of september as a result of hurricanes edouard  gustav and ike  production was shut in for much of the month of september  resulting in estimated lost production of approximately mmcf of natural gas and mbbl of oil

earnings compared with the exploration and production segment s loss from continuing operations for was million  compared with earnings from continuing operations of million for  a decrease of million 
the decrease in earnings is primarily the result of an impairment charge of million  as discussed above 
in addition  lower crude oil prices  lower natural gas prices  and lower natural gas production decreased earnings by million  million  and million  respectively  while higher crude oil production increased earnings by million 
lower interest income million and higher operating expenses million further reduced earnings 
in addition  there was a million decrease in earnings caused by a reduction in the commodity prices of residual gas and liquids sold at seneca s processing plants in the west coast and appalachian regions 
the decrease in interest income is due to lower interest rates and lower temporary cash investment balances 
the increase in operating expenses is due to an increase in bad debt expense as a result of a customer s bankruptcy filing  and higher personnel costs in the appalachian region 
these earnings decreases were partially offset by lower interest expense million  lower lease operating costs million  lower depletion expense million  and lower income tax expense million 
the 
table of contents decline in interest expense is primarily due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding 
the reduction in lease operating expenses is primarily due to a reduction in steam fuel costs in the west coast region and lower production taxes in the gulf coast region 
the decrease in depletion is primarily due to a lower full cost pool balance after the impairment charge taken during the quarter ended december  compared with the exploration and production segment s earnings from continuing operations for were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings from continuing operations of million for higher crude oil prices  higher natural gas prices and higher natural gas production increased earnings by million  million and million  respectively  while lower crude oil production decreased earnings by million 
higher lease operating costs million  higher depletion expense million  higher income tax expense million and higher general and administrative and other operating expenses million also negatively impacted earnings 
lower interest expense and higher interest income of million and million  respectively  partially offset these decreases to earnings 
the increase in lease operating costs resulted from the start up of production at the high island l field in october  higher steaming costs in california  and an increase in costs associated with a higher number of producing properties in appalachia 
the increase in depletion expense was caused by higher production and an increase in the depletable base 
the increase in general and administrative and other operating expenses resulted from an increase in staffing and associated costs for the growing appalachia division combined with the recognition of actual plugging costs in excess of previously accrued amounts 
energy marketing revenues energy marketing operating revenues year ended september thousands natural gas after hedging other energy marketing volume year ended september natural gas mmcf compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment decreased million in as compared with the decrease is primarily due to lower gas sales revenue  due to a lower average price of natural gas that was recovered through revenues 
this decline was somewhat offset by an increase in volume sold 
the increase in sales volume is largely attributable to colder weather as well as an increase in sales transactions undertaken at the niagara pipeline delivery point to offset certain basis risks that the energy marketing segment was exposed to under certain fixed basis commodity purchase contracts for appalachian production 
such offsetting transactions had the effect of increasing revenue and volume sold with minimal impact to earnings 
compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment increased million in as compared with the increase is primarily due to higher gas sales revenue  as a result of an increase in the price of natural gas that was recovered through revenues  coupled with an increase in volume sold 
the increase in volume is 
table of contents primarily attributable to an increase in volume sold to low margin wholesale customers  as well as an increase in the number of commercial and industrial customers served by the energy marketing segment 
the increase in volume also reflects certain sales transactions undertaken at the niagara pipeline delivery point to offset certain basis risks that the energy marketing segment was exposed to under certain fixed basis commodity purchase contracts for appalachian production 
such offsetting transactions had the effect of increasing revenue and volume sold with minimal impact to earnings 
earnings compared with the energy marketing segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in higher margin of million combined with lower operating costs of million primarily due to a decline in bad debt expense are responsible for the increase in earnings 
these increases were partially offset by higher income tax expense of million in as compared to the increase in margin was primarily driven by lower pipeline transportation fuel costs due to lower natural gas commodity prices  an unfavorable pipeline imbalance resolution in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal  and improved average margins per mcf  partially offset by higher pipeline reservation charges related to additional storage capacity 
compared with the energy marketing segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in higher operating costs of million primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense coupled with lower margin of million are primarily responsible for the decrease in earnings 
a major factor in the margin decrease is the non recurrence of a purchased gas expense adjustment recorded during the quarter ended march  during that quarter  the energy marketing segment reversed an accrual for million of purchased gas expense due to a resolution of a contingency 
the increase in volume noted above  the profitable sale of certain gas held as inventory  and the marketing flexibility that the energy marketing segment derives from its contracts for significant storage capacity partially offset the margin decrease associated with the purchased gas adjustment

seneca energy and model city generate and sell electricity using methane gas obtained from landfills owned by outside parties 
esne generates electricity from an megawatt  combined cycle  natural gas fired power plant in north east  pennsylvania 
earnings compared with all other and corporate operations had a loss of million in  a decrease of million compared with earnings of million for the decrease in earnings was largely attributable to lower margins from lumber  log and timber rights sales million  lower margins from horizon lfg million  lower interest income million  lower income from horizon power s investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 
table of contents million  and higher interest expense million 
the decrease in margins from lumber  log and timber rights sales is a result of a decline in revenues due to unfavorable market conditions 
the decrease in margins from horizon lfg is due to the decrease in the price of gas and lower volumes due to the poor economy 
the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of higher borrowings at a higher interest rate mostly due to the million of notes that were issued in april 
in addition  during  esne  an unconsolidated subsidiary of horizon power  recorded an impairment charge of million 
horizon power s share of the impairment was million million on an after tax basis 
in  horizon lfg recorded an impairment charge of million on its landfill gas assets million on an after tax basis 
also  horizon power recognized a gain on the sale of a turbine million during that did not recur in these earnings decreases were partially offset by lower operating costs million 
in  the proxy contest with new mountain vantage gp  llc led to an increase in operating costs  which did not recur in in addition  lower income tax expense million and a gain on life insurance policies held by the company million further offset the earnings decrease 
the impairment charge of million recorded by horizon lfg during as discussed above was comprised of a million reduction in intangible assets related to long term gas purchase contracts and a million reduction in property  plant and equipment 
the impairment was recorded due to the loss of the primary customer at a landfill gas site and the anticipated shut down of the site 
this impairment charge reduced the recorded value of intangible assets and property  plant and equipment associated with this site to zero at september  the impairment charge of million recorded by esne during as discussed above was driven by a significant decrease in run time for the plant given the economic downturn and the resulting decrease in demand for electric power

the increase in operating costs is primarily the result of the proxy contest with new mountain vantage gp  llc the decrease in margins from lumber  log and timber rights sales is a result of a decline in revenues due to unfavorable market conditions and wet weather conditions that hampered harvesting 
in addition  in  seneca s northeast division sold million board feet of timber rights and recorded a gain of million in other revenues  which did not recur in interest income interest income was million lower in as compared to lower cash investment balances in the exploration and production segment and lower interest rates on such investments were the primary factors contributing to this decrease 
interest income was million higher in as compared to the main reason for this increase was a million increase in interest income on a pension related regulatory asset in the utility segment s new york jurisdiction 
the exploration and production segment also contributed million to this increase as a result of the investment of cash proceeds from the sale of seci in august other income other income was million lower in as compared to this decrease is attributed to a million decrease in the allowance for funds used during construction in the pipeline and storage segment associated with the empire connector project 
horizon power recognized a million pre tax gain on the sale of a turbine during that did not recur in these decreases were partially offset by a death benefit gain on life insurance policies of million recognized in the corporate category during 
table of contents other income was million higher in as compared to this increase is primarily attributed to a million increase in the allowance for funds used during construction in the pipeline and storage segment associated with the empire connector project 
it also reflects a million pre tax gain on the sale of a turbine during these increases were partially offset by the non recurrence of a death benefit gain on life insurance proceeds of million recognized in the corporate category in interest charges although most of the variances in interest charges are discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  the following is a summary on a consolidated basis interest on long term debt increased million in as compared to the increase in was primarily the result of a higher average amount of long term debt outstanding combined with higher average interest rates

cash provided by operating activities in the utility and pipeline and storage segments may vary substantially from year to year because of the impact of rate cases 
in the utility segment  supplier refunds  over or under recovered purchased gas costs and weather may also significantly impact cash flow 
the impact of weather on cash flow is tempered in the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction by its wnc and in the pipeline and storage segment by the straight fixed variable rate design used by supply corporation and empire 
cash provided by operating activities in the exploration and production segment may vary from period to period as a result of changes in the commodity prices of natural gas and crude oil 
the company uses various derivative financial instruments  including price swap agreements and futures contracts in an attempt to manage this energy commodity price risk 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  an increase of million compared with the million provided by operating activities in the increase is primarily due to the timing of gas cost recovery in the utility segment

in light of the growing demand for pipeline capacity to move natural gas from new wells being drilled in appalachia specifically in the marcellus shale producing area supply corporation and empire are actively pursuing several expansion projects 
supply corporation is moving forward with two strategic compressor horsepower expansions  both supported by signed precedent agreements with appalachian producers  designed to move anticipated marcellus production gas to markets beyond supply corporation s pipeline system 
the first strategic horsepower expansion project involves new compression along supply corporation s line n  increasing that line s capacity into texas eastern s holbrook station in southwestern pennsylvania 
table of contents line n expansion project 
this project is designed and contracted for  dth day of firm transportation  and will allow anticipated marcellus production located in the vicinity of line n to flow south and access markets off texas eastern s system  with a projected in service date of november supply corporation is in the process of preparing an nga section c application to the ferc for approval of the line n expansion project 
the preliminary cost estimate for the line n expansion project is million 
the forecasted expenditures for this project over the next three years are as follows million in  million in  and million in these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
as of september   less than million has been spent to study the line n expansion project  which has been included in preliminary survey and investigation charges and has been fully reserved for at september  the second strategic horsepower expansion project involves the addition of compression at supply corporation s existing interconnect with tennessee gas pipeline at lamont  pennsylvania  with a projected in service date of may lamont project 
the lamont project is designed and contracted for  dth day of firm transportation and will afford shippers a transportation path from their anticipated marcellus production located in elk and cameron counties  pennsylvania to markets attached to tennessee gas pipeline s line 
the lamont project will not require an nga section c application  and will instead be constructed under supply corporation s existing blanket construction certificate authority from the ferc 
the preliminary cost estimate for the lamont project is million  all of which is forecasted to occur in these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
as of september   less than million has been spent to study the lamont project  which has been included in preliminary survey and investigation charges and has been fully reserved for at september  in addition  supply corporation continues to actively pursue its largest planned expansion  the west to east appalachian lateral pipeline project 
the appalachian lateral project is routed through areas in pennsylvania where producers are actively drilling and are seeking market access for their newly discovered reserves 
the appalachian lateral will complement supply corporation s original west to east we project  which was designed to transport rockies gas supply from clarington  ohio to the ellisburg leidy corning area 
the appalachian lateral will transport gas supply from pennsylvania s producing area to the overbeck area of supply corporation s existing system  from which some of the facilities associated with the we project will move the gas to eastern market points  including leidy  pennsylvania  and to interconnections with millennium and empire at corning  new york 
preliminary engineering routing analysis  project cost estimate and rate design have been completed  and prospective shippers have been offered precedent agreements for their consideration 
this project will require an nga section c application  which supply corporation has not filed 
the capital cost of all phases of the appalachian lateral we transportation projects is estimated to be in the range of million to billion 
as of september   approximately million has been spent to study the appalachian lateral we transportation projects  which has been included in preliminary survey and investigation charges and has been fully reserved for at september  supply corporation anticipates the development of the we appalachian lateral project will occur in phases  and based on requests from the marcellus producing community for transportation service commencing as early as  supply corporation began a binding open season on august  this open season offered transportation capacity on two initial phases phase i and phase ii of the we pipeline project 
the capital cost of these two phases is estimated to be million 
phase i is designed to transport approximately  dth day from the marcellus producing area through a new mile pipeline to be constructed through elk  cameron  and clinton counties to the leidy hub  with an anticipated in service date of late phase ii  with a late projected in service date  consists of an additional miles of new pipeline and compression extending through clearfield and jefferson counties to supply corporation s line k system and would provide additional transportation capacity of at least  dth day 
the forecasted expenditures for phase i and phase ii of this project over the next three years are as follows million in  million in  and million in these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
this binding open season concluded on october  with significant participation by marcellus producers 
supply corporation received binding requests for  dth day of firm transportation capacity 
table of contents and expects to execute the signed precedent agreements submitted by those marcellus producers 
supply corporation is pursuing post open season capacity requests for the remaining phase i and phase ii capacity and expects to continue marketing efforts for all sections of the we and appalachian lateral projects 
the timeline associated with the we and appalachian lateral projects will depend on market development 
in conjunction with the appalachian lateral and we transportation projects  supply corporation plans to develop new storage capacity by expanding certain of its existing storage facilities 
the expansion of these fields could provide incremental storage capacity of approximately mmdth and incremental withdrawal deliverability of up to mdth of natural gas per day  with service commencing in early supply corporation expects that the availability of this incremental storage capacity will complement the appalachian lateral we pipeline transportation projects and help balance the increasing flow of appalachian and rockies gas supply through the western pennsylvania area  and the growing demand for gas on the east coast 
this storage expansion project will require an nga section c application  which supply corporation has not yet filed 
preliminary cost estimates for the storage expansion project is million 
the forecasted expenditures for this project over the next three years are as follows million in  million in  and million in these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
as of september   approximately million has been spent to study the storage expansion project  which has been included in preliminary survey and investigation charges and has been fully reserved for at september  the timeline associated with the we and appalachian lateral projects and any related storage development will depend on market development 
on october   empire posted an open season for an expansion project that will provide at least  dth day of incremental firm transportation capacity from anticipated marcellus production at new and existing interconnection s along its recently completed empire connector line and along a proposed mile pipeline extension into tioga county  pennsylvania 
empire s preliminary cost estimate for the tioga county extension project is approximately million 
this project would enable marcellus producers to deliver their gas at existing empire interconnections with millennium pipeline at corning  new york  with transcanada pipeline at chippawa  and with utility and power generation markets along its path  as well as to a planned new interconnection with tennessee gas pipeline s line zone in ontario county  new york 
empire completed a non binding open season on october  for capacity in the tioga county extension project  and is in the process of negotiating binding precedent agreements with shippers who participated in the open season  representing more than adequate capacity to support the project facilities 
following successful negotiations  empire will file an nga section c application with the ferc for approval of this project  and anticipates that these facilities will be placed in service on or after september  the forecasted expenditures for this project over the next two years are as follows million in and million in these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
as of september   no preliminary survey and investigation charges had been expended on this project  but those activities began in october of and will be fully reserved in the periods they occur 
the timeline associated with the tioga county extension project will depend on the completion of shipper precedent agreements 
the company anticipates financing the line n expansion project  the lamont project  phase i and phase ii of the we appalachian lateral project  the storage expansion project  and the tioga county extension project  all of which are discussed above  with a combination of cash from operations  short term debt  and long term debt

the company s present liquidity position is believed to be adequate to satisfy known demands 
however  if the company were to experience another impairment of oil and gas properties in the future  it is possible that these indenture covenants would restrict the company s ability to issue additional long term unsecured indebtedness 
this would not preclude the company from issuing new indebtedness to replace maturing debt 
the company s indenture  pursuant to which million or of the company s long term debt as of september  was issued  contains a cross default provision whereby the failure by the company to perform certain obligations under other borrowing arrangements could trigger an obligation to repay the debt outstanding under the indenture 
in particular  a repayment obligation could be triggered if the company fails i to pay any scheduled principal or interest on any debt under any other indenture or agreement  or ii to perform any other term in any other such indenture or agreement  and the effect of the failure causes  or would permit the holders of the debt to cause  the debt under such indenture or agreement to become due prior to its stated maturity  unless cured or waived 
the company s million committed credit facility also contains a cross default provision whereby the failure by the company or its significant subsidiaries to make payments under other borrowing arrangements  or the occurrence of certain events affecting those other borrowing arrangements  could trigger an obligation to repay any amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility

the company believes that the likelihood it would be required to make payments under the guarantees is remote  and therefore has not included them in the table above 
other matters in addition to the environmental and other matters discussed in this item and in item at note i commitments and contingencies  the company is involved in other litigation and regulatory matters arising in the normal course of business 
these other matters may include  for example  negligence claims and tax  regulatory or other governmental audits  inspections  investigations or other proceedings

this carryover  which is available as a result of an acquisition  expires in varying amounts between and although this loss carryover is subject to certain annual limitations  no valuation allowance was recorded because of management s determination that the amount will be fully utilized during the carryforward period 
market risk sensitive instruments energy commodity price risk the company  in its exploration and production segment  energy marketing segment and pipeline and storage segment  uses various derivative financial instruments derivatives  including price swap agreements and futures contracts  as part of the company s overall energy commodity price risk management strategy 
under this strategy  the company manages a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price 
table of contents of natural gas and crude oil  thereby attempting to provide more stability to operating results 
the company has operating procedures in place that are administered by experienced management to monitor compliance with the company s risk management policies 
the derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
the fair value of these derivatives  as shown below  represents the amount that the company would receive from  or pay to  the respective counterparties at september  to terminate the derivatives 
however  the tables below and the fair value that is disclosed do not consider the physical side of the natural gas and crude oil transactions that are related to the financial instruments 
beginning in fiscal  the company adopted the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements 
in accordance with the adoption of this guidance  the company has identified certain inputs used to recognize fair value as level unobservable inputs 
the level derivative assets relate to oil swap agreements used to hedge forecasted sales at a specific location southern california 
the company s internal model that is used to calculate fair value applies a historical basis differential between the sales locations and nymex to a forward nymex curve because there is not a forward curve specific to this sales location 
given the high level of historical correlation between nymex prices and prices at this sales location  the company does not believe that the fair value recorded by the company would be significantly different from what it expects to receive upon settlement 
the fair value of the level derivative assets was reduced by million based upon the company s assessment of counterparty credit risk 
the company applied default probabilities to the anticipated cash flows that it was expecting from its counterparties to calculate the credit reserve 
the level assets amount to million at september  and represent of the derivative financial instruments assets or of the total assets as shown in item at note f fair value measurements at september  during fiscal  the company transferred million of derivative assets from level assets to level assets 
the majority of these assets related to natural gas swaps on southern california natural gas production 
the company also transferred million of derivative liabilities from level liabilities to level liabilities 
these liabilities related to certain natural gas swaps on gulf of mexico natural gas production 
these transfers occurred because the company was able to obtain and utilize forward looking  observable basis differential information for the hedges at these locations 
the company uses the crude oil swaps classified as level to hedge against the risk of declining commodity prices and not as speculative investments 
gains or losses related to these level derivative assets including any reduction for credit risk are deferred until the hedged commodity transaction occurs in accordance with the provisions of the existing guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the increase in the net fair value of the level positions from october  to september   as shown in item at note f  was attributable to a significant decrease in the commodity price of crude oil during that period 
the company believes that these fair values reasonably represent the amounts that the company would realize upon settlement based on commodity prices that were present at september  the following tables disclose natural gas and crude oil price swap information by expected maturity dates for agreements in which the company receives a fixed price in exchange for paying a variable price as quoted in various national natural gas publications or on the nymex 
notional amounts quantities are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract

the company would have received from its respective counterparties an aggregate of approximately million to terminate the crude oil price swap agreements outstanding at september  at september   the company had natural gas price swap agreements covering bcf at a weighted average fixed rate of per mcf 
the company also had crude oil price swap agreements covering  bbls at a weighted average fixed rate of per bbl 
the following table discloses the net contract volume purchased sold  weighted average contract prices and weighted average settlement prices by expected maturity date for futures contracts used to manage natural gas price risk

they are accounted for as fair value hedges and are used by the company s energy marketing segment to hedge against rising prices  a risk to which this segment is exposed to due to the fixed price gas sales commitments that it enters into with residential  commercial and industrial customers 
the company would have had to pay million to terminate these futures contracts at september  at september   the company had short sold futures contracts covering bcf of gas extending through at a weighted average contract price of per mcf and a weighted average settlement price of per mcf 
of this amount  bcf is accounted for as cash flow hedges as these contracts relate to the anticipated sale of natural gas by the energy marketing segment 
the remaining bcf is accounted for as fair value hedges used to hedge against falling prices  a risk to which the energy marketing segment is exposed to due to the fixed price gas purchase commitments that it enters into with its natural gas suppliers 
the company would have received million to terminate these futures contracts at september  at september   the company had futures contracts covering bcf net long position at a weighted average contract price of per mcf 
the company may be exposed to credit risk on any of the derivative financial instruments that are in a gain position 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss that the company would incur as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations 
to mitigate such credit risk  management 
table of contents performs a credit check  and then on a quarterly basis monitors counterparty credit exposure

the company had derivative financial instruments that were in loss positions with the other two counterparties 
the company had million of credit exposure with one counterparty which is rated a moody s investor service  a s p  and a fitch ratings service as of september  
on average for those financial instruments that were in a gain position  the company had million of credit exposure per counterparty with the other seven counterparties that were in a gain position 
the company had not received any collateral from the counterparties at september  since the company s gain position on such derivative financial instruments had not exceeded the established thresholds at which the counterparties would be required to post collateral 
as of september   eight of the ten counterparties to the company s outstanding derivative instrument contracts specifically the over the counter swaps had a common credit risk related contingency feature 
in the event the company s credit rating increases or falls below a certain threshold the lower of the s p or moody s debt rating  the available credit extended to the company would either increase or decrease 
a decline in the company s credit rating  in and of itself  would not cause the company to be required to increase the level of its hedging collateral deposits in the form of cash deposits  letters of credit or treasury debt instruments 
if the company s outstanding derivative instrument contracts were in a liability position and the company s credit rating declined  then additional hedging collateral deposits would be required 
at september   these credit risk related contingency features were not triggered since the company had assets of million related to derivative financial instruments with the eight counterparties 
for its exchange traded futures contracts  which are in an asset position  the company had paid million in hedging collateral as of september  as these are exchange traded futures contracts  there are no specific credit risk related contingency features 
the company posts hedging collateral based on open positions ie those positions that have been settled for cash and margin requirements 
this is discussed in note a under hedging collateral deposits 
interest rate risk the following table presents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for the company s long term fixed rate debt as well as the other long term debt of certain of the company s subsidiaries

the rate order further provided for a return on equity of 
in connection with the efficiency and conservation program  the rate order also adopted distribution corporation s proposed revenue decoupling mechanism 
the revenue decoupling mechanism  like others  decouples revenues from throughput by enabling the company to collect from small volume customers its allowed margin on average weather normalized usage per customer 
the effect of the revenue decoupling mechanism is to render the company financially indifferent to throughput decreases resulting from conservation 
the company surcharges or credits any difference from the average weather normalized usage per customer account 
the surcharge or credit is calculated to recover total margin for the most recent twelve month period ending december  and is applied to customer bills annually  beginning march st 
on april   distribution corporation filed an appeal with supreme court  albany county  seeking review of the rate order 
the appeal contends that portions of the rate order should be invalidated because they fail to meet the applicable legal standard for agency decisions

briefs were filed and oral argument was held on october  the company cannot predict the outcome of the appeal at this time

for further discussion refer to item at note i commitments and contingencies under the heading environmental matters 
legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussions 
if enacted or adopted  legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the company s cost of environmental compliance by requiring the company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities and or purchase emission allowances 
proposed measures could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities 
but legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit the company by increasing demand for natural gas  because substantially fewer carbon emissions per btu of heat generated are associated with the use of natural gas than with certain alternate fuels such as coal and oil 
the effect material or not on the company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted
