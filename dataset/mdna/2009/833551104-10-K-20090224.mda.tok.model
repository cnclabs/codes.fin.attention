table of contents executive summary from an earnings perspective  was a year impacted significantly by higher input costs 
for the first three quarters of  we earned per share as compared to in same period of significant escalations in ingredient costs  fuel rates  utility costs and unfavorable foreign exchange rates far outpaced sales price increases to our customers 
during the fourth quarter  we were able to restore our operating profit margin and earn per share compared to in the fourth quarter of and in the fourth quarter of these results were achieved despite a million pre tax charge for a change in our employee vacation policy and costs associated with the archway acquisition of million  including million in payments to former archway employees 
in total  these items decreased earnings per share during the fourth quarter of by from an operational perspective  we continued to focus on the following priorities in order to develop a foundation for profitable growth organizational development and effectiveness in order to align our organization to achieve our goals  operational efficiencies in our dsd operations  supply chain process  and information technology systems  focused growth in core channels and product lines while we simplify our business and create new platforms for growth 
to that end  we have continued to focus on our priorities as we transform lance into a leader within our niche snack food categories 
our transformation is focused on delivering key goals including delivering accelerated sales growth  widening our profit margins  improving return on capital and driving growth in our earnings per share 
during  our accomplishments included two acquisitions the acquisition of brent sam s  inc and substantially all of the assets of archway cookies  llc o brent sam s was acquired in march of  added approximately million in revenue in and expanded our premium private brand product offerings to our customers 
o the archway assets were acquired in december of the acquisition of the archway brand provides a strong brand with a long history of quality home style cookies that we believe we can grow through product innovation and improved customer service through our dsd and distributor network 
the archway facility also provides additional production capacity 
in addition  based on the location of the facility we plan to improve our supply chain operations efficiency through a centralized location to service our customers in the midwest and northeast 
continued dsd organizational improvements o we continued to realign our dsd sales organization by rationalizing our customer stops based on profitability and operating efficiency needed to service our customers 
during  we increased the weekly net revenue per route by 
o we have also implemented improved processes in our dsd organization to improve the efficiency of the time it takes to service our customers at each stop 

table of contents we continued to focus on sales growth o revenue from both lance brand home pack products and cape cod potato chip products increased more than over last year 
o private brand revenue increased approximately  of which approximately was the result of the acquisition of brent sam s 
o during  we introduced a mainstream private brand line of products that is a more premium product than our value line private brands and provides consumers additional options from traditional branded products 
o we increased our focus on innovation to provide a constant stream of new product introductions for our customers 
we continued to build a foundation for growth o we continued to improve our supply chain efficiency by consolidating our canadian operations from three plants to two and increased the volume of products transported per mile through the use of larger trailers  which minimized the effect of increases in diesel fuel rates 
o in  we implemented a portion of our erp solution and expect to have the erp system implemented at all locations by the end of we believe the cost increases that eroded earnings per share in the first three quarters of are behind us and we are well positioned for continued growth in we plan additional spending for advertising in in order to support future sales growth of our branded products 
in addition  we plan to increase new product introductions and expand product innovation to provide our consumers with additional snack food offerings 
during january  there was a recall of products containing peanuts  peanut butter paste and peanut butter purchased from peanut corp 
of america pca due to potential salmonella contamination 
no products bearing the lance brand were included in this recall as we internally source our peanuts and peanut butter 
in  we purchased brent and sam s  inc who historically purchased product from pca and voluntarily recalled a limited number of private brand cookie products related to this concern  but we do not expect this to have a material impact on our results of operations 
brent and sam s now sources its peanut butter through lance 
critical accounting estimates preparing the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we believe the following estimates and assumptions to be critical accounting estimates 
these assumptions and estimates may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and may have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition our policy on revenue recognition varies based on the types of products sold and the distribution method 
we recognize operating revenue when title and risk of loss passes to our customers 
allowances for sales returns  stale products  promotions and discounts are also recorded as reductions of revenue in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue for products sold through our dsd system is recognized when the product is delivered to the retailer 
our sales representative creates the invoice at time of delivery using a handheld computer 
the invoice is transmitted electronically each day and sales revenue is recognized 
customers purchasing products through the dsd system have the right to return product if it is not sold by the expiration date on the product label 
we have recorded an estimated allowance for product that might be returned as a reduction to revenue 
we estimate the number of days until product is sold through the customer s location and the percent of sales returns using historical information 
this information is reviewed on a quarterly basis for significant changes and updated no less than annually 
revenue for products shipped directly to the customer from our warehouse is recognized based on the shipping terms listed on the shipping documentation 
products shipped with terms fob shipping point are recognized as revenue at the time the shipment leaves our warehouses 
products shipped with terms fob destination are recognized as revenue based on the anticipated receipt date by the customer 
we record certain reductions to revenue for promotional allowances 
there are several different types of promotional allowances such as off invoice allowances  rebates and shelf space allowances 
an off invoice allowance is a reduction of the sales price that is directly deducted from the invoice amount 
we record the amount of the deduction as a reduction to revenue when the transaction occurs 
rebates are offered to customers based on the quantity of product purchased over a period of time 
based on the nature of these allowances  the exact amount of the rebate is not known at the time the product is sold to the customer 
an estimate of the expected rebate amount is recorded as a reduction to revenue and an accrued liability at the time the sale is recorded 
the accrued liability is monitored throughout the period covered by the promotion 
the accrual is based on historical information and the progress of the customer against the target amount 
shelf space allowances are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life of the agreement or three years and recorded as a reduction to revenue 
capitalized shelf space allowances are evaluated for impairment on an ongoing basis 
we also record certain allowances for coupon redemptions  scan back promotions and other promotional activities as a reduction to revenue 
the accrued liability is monitored throughout the period covered by the coupon or promotion 
total allowances for sales returns  rebates  coupons  scan backs and other promotional activities included in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets increased from million at the end of to million at the end of due to a more aggressive marketing effort to drive sales growth 
allowance for doubtful accounts the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimate of uncollectible accounts receivables 
we record a general reserve based on analysis of historical data and the aging of accounts receivable 
in addition  management records specific reserves for receivable balances that are considered at higher risk due to known facts regarding the customer 
the assumptions for this determination are regularly reviewed to ensure that business conditions or other circumstances are consistent with the assumptions 
allowances for doubtful accounts increased from million at the end of to million at the end of due to current economic conditions resulting in slower payments from some customers  higher accounts receivable  and increased specific reserves for customers with higher risks 
the recent instability in the us economy may weaken the ability of our customers to perform under contractual obligations or in the normal course of business  which may expose us to additional bad debt expense related to bankruptcies among our customers 

table of contents self insurance reserves we maintain reserves for the self funded portions of employee medical insurance and for post retirement healthcare benefits 
the employer s portion of employee and retiree medical claims is limited by stop loss insurance coverage each year to million per person 
in addition  we maintain insurance reserves for the self funded portions of workers compensation  auto  product and general liability insurance 
self insured accruals are based on claims filed and estimated claims incurred but not reported based on historical claims trends 
for casualty insurance obligations  we maintain self insurance reserves for workers compensation and auto liability for individual losses up to million 
in addition  general and product liability claims are self funded for individual losses up to million 
we evaluate input from a third party actuary in the estimation of the casualty insurance obligation on an annual basis 
in determining the ultimate loss and reserve requirements  we use various actuarial assumptions including compensation trends  healthcare cost trends and discount rates 
we also use historical information for claims frequency and severity in order to establish loss development factors 
the estimate of loss reserves ranged from million to million in in  the estimate of loss reserves ranged from million to million 
consistent with prior periods  the th percentile of this range represents our best estimate of the ultimate outstanding casualty liability 
we used a discount rate on the estimated claims liability in and based on projected investment returns over the estimated future payout period 
impairment analysis of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the annual impairment analysis of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets requires us to project future financial performance  including revenue and profit growth  fixed asset and working capital investments  income tax rates and cost of capital 
these projections rely upon historical performance  anticipated market conditions and forward looking business plans 
the analysis of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets as of december  assumes combined average annual revenue growth of approximately during the valuation period 
we also use a combination of internal and external data to develop the weighted average cost of capital 
significant investments in fixed assets and working capital to support this growth are estimated and factored into the analysis 
if the forecasted revenue growth is not achieved  the required investments in fixed assets and working capital could be reduced 
even with the excess fair value over carrying value  significant changes in assumptions or changes in conditions could result in a goodwill impairment charge in the future 
depreciation and impairment of fixed assets depreciation of fixed assets is computed using the straight line method over the lives of the assets 
the lives used in computing depreciation are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will provide economic benefits 
estimated lives are based on historical experience  maintenance practices  technological changes and future business plans 
depreciation expense was million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
changes in these estimated lives and increases in capital expenditures could significantly affect depreciation expense in the future 
fixed assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of fixed assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if this comparison indicates that an asset s carrying amount is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized  and the adjusted carrying amount is depreciated over the asset s remaining useful life 

table of contents assets that are to be disposed of by sale are recognized in the financial statements at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell  and are not depreciated once they are classified as held for sale 
in order for an asset to be classified as held for sale  the asset must be actively marketed  available for immediate sale and meet certain other specified criteria 
equity incentive expense determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term  expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
judgment is required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited before vesting 
in addition  our long term equity incentive plans require assumptions and projections of future operating results and financial metrics 
actual results may differ from these assumptions and projections  which could have a material impact on our financial results 
provision for income taxes we estimate valuation allowances on deferred tax assets for the portions that we do not believe will be fully utilized based on projected earnings and usage 
our effective tax rate is based on the level and mix of income of our separate legal entities  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions that affect the annual tax rate 
unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are established when  despite the fact that the tax return positions are supportable  we believe these positions may be challenged and the results are uncertain 
we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit
