item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we are a canadian corporation  with principal assets and operations in the united states  whose primary business is developing and commercializing nanomaterial and titanium dioxide pigment technologies 
for nearly all of  we were organized into three divisions  a power and energy group formally known as the advanced materials and power systems division  a performance materials division  and a life sciences division 
our research  development  production and marketing efforts are currently directed toward three primary market applications that utilize our proprietary technologies power and energy group o the design  development  and production of our nano lithium titanate battery cells  batteries  and battery packs as well as related design and test services 
o the development  production and sale for testing purposes of electrode materials for use in a new class of high performance lithium ion batteries called nano lithium titanate batteries 
performance materials division o through alsher titania  the development and production of high quality titanium dioxide pigment for use in paint and coatings  and nano titanium dioxide materials for use in a variety of applications including those related to removing contaminants from air and water 
o the testing  development  marketing and or licensing of nano structured ceramic powders for use in various application  such as advanced performance coatings  air and water purification systems  and nano sensor applications 
life sciences division o the co development of renazorb  a test stage active pharmaceutical ingredient  which is designed to be useful in the treatment of elevated serum phosphate levels in patients undergoing kidney dialysis 
o the development of a manufacturing process related to a test stage active pharmaceutical ingredient  which is designed to be useful in the treatment of companion animals 
we also provide contract research services on select projects where we can utilize our resources to develop intellectual property and or new products and technology 
although contract services revenue comprised a significant portion of our total revenues in recent years accounting for   and  respectively in  and  we do not expect this to continue 
near the end of  we made the decision to focus on power and energy products as we believe that area contains the most promise for the company 
in the summary of our business below  we describe our various research products in connection with our description of the business segment to which each relates 
our revenues have been  and we expect them to continue to be  generated by license fees  product sales  commercial collaborations and contracts and grants 
we currently have agreements in place to provide research to further develop battery electrode materials  nanosensors  and nanomaterials characterization  participate in a joint venture combining the technologies of the partners in order to develop and produce titanium dioxide pigment for use in a variety of applications  develop a suite of energy storage solutions for the stationary power market develop battery backup power systems for naval applications and develop power and energy systems for other military applications 
in addition  we have entered into a licensing agreement for renazorb  our pharmaceutical candidate for treatment of chronic renal failure in humans 
we have made product sales consisting principally of battery packs and nano lithium titanate 
future revenues will depend on the success of our contracted projects  the results of our other research and development work  the success of the renazorb application licensee in obtaining regulatory approval for the drugs  or other products  and the success of our marketing efforts with respect to both product sales and technology licenses 
in  our development partner for a pharmaceutical candidate for the animal treatment market  elanco animal health  made the decision to terminate spending on that program and our service agreement with elanco was subsequently terminated 
we continue to pursue another partner for the development of that product 
general outlook we have generated net losses in each fiscal year since incorporation 
revenues from product sales  commercial collaborations and contracts and grants decreased significantly in  as did operating expenses 
the revenue decrease was due almost entirely to the reduced level of product sales in the automotive sector as a result of the difficulties encountered by phoenix mc in launching their electric vehicle 
the operating expense decrease was primarily the result of several one time events related to the november financing and the phoenix mc battery replacement 
our gross profit margins on customer contracts for research and development work are very low  and as a result we have shifted our focus to move away from these opportunities 
our current focus is on the development of products and technologies in energy storage that we anticipate will eventually bring a substantial amount of higher margin revenues from licensing  manufacturing  product sales and other sources 
we expect our nano lithium titanate batteries and battery materials to be a source of such higher margin revenues 
consequently  during  we continued to expand the scope of our power and energy group by hiring additional staff and increasing temporary personnel to handle the conversion from a prototype to a commercial product  adding additional sales and marketing personnel to focus on this market  and acquiring test and production equipment 
as we attempt to significantly expand our revenues from licensing  manufacturing  sales and other sources  some of the key near term events that will affect our long term success prospects include the following in may  we successfully completed the trial of a megawatt battery system with aes energy storage  llc  a subsidiary of global power leader the aes corporation 
under the terms of the agreement  kema an independent third party designed and oversaw the system testing and then prepared a final report assessing the battery system s performance 
the system performed well and according to kema the battery system successfully demonstrated the potential of using the new battery technology for utility applications 
there were no inherent design limitations identified in its application within the designed mw power handling range 
based on the success of this trial we are continuing to develop our relationship with aes and have generated a substantial amount of interest in the product from other entities 
in july  we terminated our contractual relationship with phoenix to provide them with lithium titanate battery packs and resolved all outstanding issues with them 
the transportation market in general for lithium ion batteries has been slower to develop than we initially anticipated 
as a consequence  we have shifted more of our focus to stationary power and military applications that are evolving more rapidly 
our efforts with the us military and the british ministry of defense mod continue to move forward positively on a number of different projects 
initial testing phases on each project with the us army  us navy and mod have all progressed impressively and ongoing government funding for is in place 
spectrum must begin the testing and application processes necessary to receive fda approval of renazorb and related products 
spectrum is currently doing an in vivo competitive study to determine the efficacy of the alternate high surface area product they requested from us compared to fosrenol 
this will take approximately two months to complete 
then  if renazorb performs well against fosrenol  spectrum has indicated that it will begin the pre clinical work which originally was expected to take about one year to complete 
consequently  we now do not expect the application to be filed until mid we previously had formed the alsher titania joint venture with the sherwin williams company to develop and produce titanium dioxide pigment for use in paint and coatings 
during  the ton per annum pilot plant was commissioned and operated producing pigment material for evaluation and to provide engineering data to complete a cost study relating to the anticipated scale up to a  ton per annum demonstration plant 
engineering data was produced and delivered to the sherwin williams company in the first week of january at this time  neither sherwin williams nor altair is willing to commit the resources necessary to build the  ton per annum demonstration plant 
alsher continues to look for a third party interested in this technology 
although it is not essential that all of these projects be successful in order to permit substantial long term revenue growth  we believe that full commercialization of several of our technologies will be necessary in order to expand our revenues enough to create a likelihood of our becoming profitable in the long term 
we remain optimistic with respect to our current key projects  as well as others we are pursuing  but recognize that  with respect to each  there are development  marketing  partnering and other risks to be overcome 
liquidity and capital resources current and expected liquidity our cash and short term investments decreased from  at december  to  at december  in september  we entered into a stock purchase and settlement agreement with al yousuf llc in which al yousuf purchased  common shares for  and received another  common shares in settlement for all potential claims resulting from its investment of million 
exercises of stock options and warrants and other cash inflows  including the al yousuf stock purchase  increased cash by  these increases were offset by cash used to fund operations of  and to purchase fixed assets of approximately during the months ended december   our cash used in operations was  this amount included  of significant one time or annual payments in the first quarter of as follows  of commission and expenses were paid to the placement agent in connection with our sale of common shares for an aggregate purchase price of  to al yousuf  llc in november   was paid in connection with the bonus plan and  of raw materials purchases made in in anticipation of receipt of the next sales order from phoenix under the purchase agreement 
we intend to use these funds for working capital  ongoing retirement of long term debt  capital expenditures  research and development activities and the potential acquisition of other technologies 
net cash used in operations was  in  and we expect to decrease funding of operations by approximately million to approximately million in  net of anticipated revenues  based upon budgeted revenue growth and expansion of our production capabilities in and the non recurrence of several large one time costs in over the long term  we anticipate substantially increasing revenues by entering into new contracts and increasing product sales in the stationary power market 
however  this increase in revenues will be dependent on our ability to transition our stationary power products from prototypes into commercial grade products 
during  we continued making significant expenditures for our battery initiative  added staff and equipment for the manufacture of nanoparticle products and increased our sales and marketing efforts 
in  we intend to increase spending on our battery initiatives continuing the enhancement of our products and their conversion into commercial grade products 
we estimate that our current cash and short term investments balance is sufficient to support our operations through the end of based on budgeted cash flow projections 
historically  we have financed operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities common shares  convertible debentures  stock options and warrants and by the issuance of debt 
depending upon the growth rate of our battery revenues  we will most likely need to raise additional capital to fund this growth during the second half of we do not have any commitments with respect to future financing and may  or may not  be able to obtain such financing on reasonable terms  or at all 
we have a single note payable in the original principal amount of  that does not contain any restrictive covenants with respect to the issuance of additional debt or equity securities by altair 
the first four payments of  of principal plus accrued interest were due and paid on february    and the final payment of principal and interest is due on february  capital commitments and expenditures the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due as of december  less than after contractual obligations total year years years years notes payable interest on notes payable contractual service agreements facilities and property operating leases property and capital leases unfulfilled purchase orders total contractual obligations in connection with the formation of the alsher titania joint venture  under the first stage we committed to complete our pigment processing pilot plant and commissioned the plant by the end of february total capital expenditures  labor and development costs associated with this effort were approximately million 
considerable data has been generated and compiled into an engineering data package analysis and recommendation on next steps 
based on review of this package  its impact on financial projections  and input from our partner  we will consider in early whether to undertake a more detailed engineering cost study relating to the potential scale up to a significantly larger demonstration plant 
at this time  neither altair nor sherwin williams has expressed a willingness to finance the construction of the development scale plant that would be required as the next major milestone 
alsher is actively seeking a partner or partners to participate in this next phase 
several companies with raw materials resources have indicated interest in the technology  but none has been willing to make any commitment up to now 
without additional capital  it is unlikely that alsher will be able to independently fund this effort 
in july  we signed a new lease agreement for  square feet of space in the flagship business accelerator building located at enterprise drive  anderson  indiana 
on march   we signed an addendum to this lease that increased the space leased by  square feet 
the move from the former office and laboratory space leased in the flagship enterprise center building to the accelerator building was completed by late february we have spent approximately  on build out and leasehold improvements during we purchased equipment for our reno  nevada facility for use in the development and expansion of our current advanced battery materials production capabilities 
through december   approximately million was expended on production equipment 
depending upon the speed of our revenue growth in  we plan to spend approximately million on production and tooling equipment associated with our power and energy systems group capacity expansion 
in  after becoming aware of a module configuration problem in the first generation phoenix battery packs manufactured in  we agreed to replace of the packs by means of a credit against re designed second generation battery packs and related engineering services and recorded a warranty liability of  in the december  financial statements 
in july  phoenix agreed to take back the original battery packs and to install an additional safety feature with them in the vehicles they planned to manufacture 
in return  we forgave the million in notes owed us by phoenix  reversed the warranty liability and settled all outstanding claims between phoenix and altair 
we do not anticipate further development or product sales with phoenix in critical accounting policies and estimates management based the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to long lived assets  share based compensation  revenue recognition  overhead allocation  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory  and deferred income tax 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
changes to these judgments and estimates could adversely affect the company s future results of operations and cash flows 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist principally of the nanomaterials and titanium dioxide pigment assets  the intellectual property patents and patent applications associated with them  and a building 
included in these long lived assets are those that relate to our research and development process 
these assets are initially evaluated for capitalization based on statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
if the assets have alternative future uses in research and development projects or otherwise  they are capitalized when acquired or constructed  if they do not have alternative future uses  they are expensed as incurred 
at december   the carrying value of these assets was  or of total assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
in our evaluation  we estimate the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  and recognize impairment when such cash flows will be less than the carrying values 
events or circumstances that could indicate the existence of a possible impairment include obsolescence of the technology  an absence of market demand for the product  and or the partial or complete lapse of technology rights protection 
share based compensation 
we have a stock incentive plan that provides for the issuance of stock options  restricted stock and other awards to employees and service providers 
we calculate compensation expense under sfas r using a black scholes merton option pricing model 
in so doing  we estimate certain key assumptions used in the model 
we believe the estimates we use  which are presented in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  are appropriate and reasonable 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been performed  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable 
during  our revenues were derived from three sources product sales  commercial collaborations  and contract research and development 
license fees are recognized when the agreement is signed  we have performed all material obligations related to the particular milestone payment or other revenue component and the earnings process is complete 
revenue for product sales is recognized upon delivery of the product  unless specific contractual terms dictate otherwise 
based on the specific terms and conditions of each contract grant  revenues are recognized on a time and materials basis  a percentage of completion basis and or a completed contract basis 
revenue under contracts based on time and materials is recognized at contractually billable rates as labor hours and expenses are incurred 
revenue under contracts based on a fixed fee arrangement is recognized based on various performance measures  such as stipulated milestones 
as these milestones are achieved  revenue is recognized 
from time to time  facts develop that may require us to revise our estimated total costs or revenues expected 
the cumulative effect of revised estimates is recorded in the period in which the facts requiring revisions become known 
the full amount of anticipated losses on any type of contract is recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
payments received in advance relating to future performance of services or delivery of products are deferred until the performance of the service is complete or the product is shipped 
upfront payments received in connection with certain rights granted in contractual arrangements are deferred and amortized over the related time period over which the benefits are received 
based on specific customer bill and hold agreements  revenue is recognized when the inventory is shipped to a third party storage warehouse  the inventory is segregated and marked as sold  the customer takes the full rights of ownership and title to the inventory upon shipment to the warehouse per the bill and hold agreement 
when contract terms include multiple components that are considered separate units of accounting  the revenue is attributed to each component and revenue recognition may occur at different points in time for product shipment  installation  and service contracts based on substantial completion of the earnings process 
accrued warranty 
we provide a limited warranty for battery packs and energy storage systems 
a liability is recorded for estimated warranty obligations at the date products are sold 
since these are new products  the estimated cost of warranty coverage is based on cell and module life cycle testing and compared for reasonableness to warranty rates on competing battery products 
as sufficient actual historical data is collected on the new product  the estimated cost of warranty coverage will be adjusted accordingly 
the liability for estimated warranty obligations may also be adjusted based on specific warranty issues identified 
overhead allocation 
facilities overheads  which are comprised primarily of occupancy and related expenses  and fringe benefit expenses  are initially recorded in general and administrative expenses and then allocated monthly to research and development expense based on labor costs 
facilities overheads and fringe benefits allocated to research and development projects may be chargeable when invoicing customers under certain research and development contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
we analyze historical bad debts  the aging of customer accounts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
from period to period  differences in judgments or estimates utilized may result in material differences in the amount and timing of our bad debt expenses 
inventory 
the company values its inventories generally at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques 
the standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted annually 
overhead rates are recorded to inventory based on normal capacity 
any idle facility costs or excessive spoilage are recorded as current period charges 
deferred income tax 
income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
future tax benefits are subject to a valuation allowance when management is unable to conclude that its deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realized from the results of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred income tax assets that may not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on the historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets become deductible  management believes it more likely than not that the company will not realize benefits of these deductible differences as of december  management has  therefore  established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred income tax assets as of december  due to the significant increase in common shares issued and outstanding from through  section of the internal revenue code may provide significant limitations on the utilization of our net operating loss carry forwards 
as a result of these limitations  a portion of these loss and credit carryovers may expire without being utilized 
results of operations fiscal year vs 
revenues decreased by  from  in to  in  while operating expenses decreased by  from  in to  in as a result  our loss from operations decreased by  from  in to  in product sales decreased from  in to  in the volume of battery packs sold to phoenix dropped from in to zero in resulting in a  decrease in product sales 
the sales cycle associated with sales of our stationary power batteries for use in providing ancillary services over the grid has turned out to be longer than originally anticipated resulting in the slower ramp up of revenue from that source 
commercial collaborations revenues decreased  from  in to  in this decrease is primarily due to the discontinuance of the western oil sands project in may contract and grant revenues increased from  in to  in  principally in connection with a new grant received in january from the office of naval research 
this increase was offset by decreased revenues from several other grants as the grants concluded during the second and third quarters of cost of sales product decreased by  from  in to  in this decrease is driven by the decrease in battery pack sales and other changes in product sales discussed above 
positive margins have not yet been achieved associated with the sale of battery packs due to scaling issues  and we expect that situation to continue well into as higher production volumes and cost reduction efforts are achieved  the margin on battery pack sales is expected to become positive 
cost of sales warranty and inventory reserves decreased by  in  from  in to a credit of  in costs were high due to several one time events including  for the write off of all inventory balances on hand at december  of  relating to battery cells and modules  and  for cells ordered in for delivery in an additional decrease in reserves by  resulted from a letter of agreement effective july with phoenix  whereby the purchase and supply agreement was terminated and the parties resolved all outstanding issues with respect to the warranty associated with the battery packs sold in research and development expense increased by  from  in to  in research and development payroll costs increased by  including fringe benefits expenses due to an increase in headcount of from the start of through april of  however  headcount has decreased by from april through the conclusion of december to align personnel with required resources 
temporary labor costs decreased by  primarily due to the decrease in battery pack production and construction testing of the pigment pilot plant 
excluding labor  research and development expenses in the power and energy systems group increased by  primarily due to materials relating to customer purchase orders and development agreements and engineering and other research and development activities 
excluding labor  research and development expenses decreased by  in the performance materials division primarily due to  as the department of energy grant concluded in december   due to the relocation of western oil sands to another facility in may  and  from construction and testing of the pigment pilot plant 
the remaining increase relates to other internal research and development 
interest income decreased by  from  in to  in on average  a higher average level of cash during than in was more than offset by lower interest rates in than in fiscal year vs 
revenues increased by  from  in to  in  while operating expenses increased by  from  in to  in as a result  our loss from operations increased by  from  in to  in product sales increased from  in to  in the volume of battery packs sold to phoenix grew from in to in resulting in a  increase in product sales 
the remaining increase of  reflects a higher level of sales volume for prototype battery cells  battery modules  nano lithium titanate  and other nanomaterial products 
license fees decreased by  from to in  license fees of  associated with the spectrum pharmaceutical and elanco animal health contracts was recorded 
in  no additional milestones were achieved under these contracts 
commercial collaborations revenues increased from  in to  in primarily due to  of increased billings associated with new contacts signed in with aes  the second phase of elanco animal health development contract  and ppg 
this increase was offset by  of non recurring collaborations that were finalized in contract and grant revenues increased from  in to  in  principally as a result of billings of  under the million department of energy earmark relating to the momentum gained in the project that was originally effective in september  billings of  under our subcontract with ppg signed in july and billings of  under the university of reno nanosensors subcontract effective in january this increase was partially offset by a reduction in revenues of  primarily relating to the subcontract with the university of nevada  las vegas research foundation and the national science foundation grant that were coming to completion in cost of sales product increased by  from  in to  in this increase was driven by the increase in battery pack sales and other changes in product sales discussed above 
positive margins associated with the sale of battery packs were not achieved due to scaling issues  and a portion of the revenues relating to the battery packs was dependent upon the receipt of zero emission credits 
through december   no zev credits were sold by phoenix motorcars  inc cost of sales warranty and inventory reserves increased by  in  as there was no warranty expense for  of this increase relates to a write off of all inventory balances on hand at december  of  relating to battery cells and modules  and a  write off of cells ordered in for delivery in the remaining increase of  relates to warranty reserves of  and  recorded based upon battery product sales to aes and phoenix  respectively 
the write off of inventory associated with the phoenix battery packs and the warranty recorded in connection with phoenix resulted from our decision to replace of the phoenix packs manufactured in under warranty provisions 
research and development  or r d  expense increased by  from  in to  in research and development payroll costs increased by  including fringe benefits expenses due to an increase in headcount of temporary labor costs also increased by  primarily due to the growth in battery pack production and construction testing of the pigment pilot plant 
excluding labor  research and development expenses in the power and energy systems group increased by  primarily due to the aes development agreement signed in and an increased focus on developing potential new battery products 
excluding labor  research and development expenses in the life sciences division increased by  primarily due to work billed to us under our subcontract with the university of california santa barbara relating to the department of energy grant and signing of the second phase of the development contract with elanco animal health in excluding labor  research and development expenses increased by  in the performance materials division primarily due to the construction and testing of the pigment pilot plant increase of  increased spending on existing and new billable contracts increase of  offset by non recurring collaborations and subcontracts completed in decrease of 
the remaining increase relates to other internal research and development 
general and administrative expenses increased by  from  in to  in stock based compensation expense  a non cash item  increased by  due to a higher level of new employees eligible for and receiving option grants  as well as an overall higher level of employees who received retention grants in january  payroll costs including fringe expense increased by  due to expansion of the executive team as well as other related increases in recruiting  relocation  and travel of  fringe benefit expenses allocable to all general and administrative personnel increased by  primarily due to a higher level of bonus earned in  and accounting fees increased by  primarily due to tax reviews and re filing of tax returns undertaken in in response to new accounting pronouncements 
these increases were partially offset by  of expenses associated with a flood at our headquarters in reno  nevada in january and a decrease of  in other general and administrative expenses 
interest income increased by  from  in to  in on average a higher level of cash was available for investment in  million in versus million in item a
