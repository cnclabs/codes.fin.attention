item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in item the following information includes forward looking statements  the realization of which may be affected by certain important factors discussed under risk factors 
overview we are an independent architect of enterprise class information storage infrastructures 
we derive our revenues principally from designing  installing and supporting data storage systems 
our solutions can include hardware products  such as disk arrays  tape systems and interconnection components and storage management software products 
the market for data storage products and services is large 
idc estimates that digital information will occupy more than six times its current quantity  or billion gigabytes  by as of december   we have locations throughout the united states 
we historically have derived our greatest percentage of net sales from customers located in the central part of the united states 
we sell support service contracts to most of our customers 
when customers purchase support services through us  customers receive the benefit of integrated system wide support 
we have a qualified  independent support desk that takes calls from customers  diagnoses the issues they are facing and either solves the problem or coordinates with datalink and or vendor technical staff to meet the customer s needs 
our support service agreements with our customers include an underlying agreement with the product manufacturer 
the manufacturer provides on site support assistance if necessary 
we defer revenues and direct costs resulting from these contracts  and amortize these revenues and expenses into operations  over the term of the contracts  which are generally twelve months 
the enterprise class information storage market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
our competition includes other independent storage system integrators  high end value added resellers  distributors  consultants and the internal sales force of our suppliers 
our ability to hire and retain qualified outside sales representatives and engineers with enterprise class information storage experience is critical to effectively competing in the marketplace and achieving our growth strategies 
in the past  we have experienced fluctuations in the timing of orders from our customers  and we expect to continue to experience these fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  among other things  the time required to design  test and evaluate our data storage solutions before customers deploy them  the size of customer orders  the complexity of our customers network environments  necessary system configuration to deploy our solutions and new product introductions by suppliers 
completion of our installation and configuration services may also delay recognition of revenues 
current economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions and timing to place orders with us and the size of those orders 
as a result  our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we view the current data storage market as providing significant opportunity for growth 
currently  datalink s market share is a small part of the overall market 
however  the providers of the data storage industry s products and technologies are increasing their utilization of indirect sales approaches to broaden their reach and optimize their margins 
increasingly  they are turning to companies such as datalink to sell their products 
while these trends provide opportunity for datalink  we must improve our business model to generate sustainable  profitable growth 
our model requires highly skilled sales and technical staff which results in substantial fixed costs for us 
we believe the best way to improve our company and create long term shareholder value is to focus on building scaleable capabilities and a leverageable cost structure 
our current strategies are focused on investing in customer facing teams to acquire top tier sales and technical talent which we believe will increase our market share in key locations 
deepening our presence in existing enterprise accounts and penetrating new enterprise accounts 
targeting high growth market segments and deploying new technologies which focus on cost savings technologies for our customers 
reducing our cost structure and realigning resources to improve efficiencies 
expanding our customer support capabilities and tools based professional services offerings that we believe will provide more value to our customers 
exploring potential acquisitions that we believe can strengthen our resources and capabilities in key geographic locations 
to pursue these strategies  we are improving our training  tools and recruiting efforts for sales and technical teams to increase productivity 
focusing on corporate expense reductions 
driving high levels of efficiency by streamlining our supply chain and expanding our professional services tools 
meeting with potential acquisition candidates 
all of these plans have various challenges and risks associated with them  including that the worldwide economic downturn may adversely affect our customers buying patterns 
we may not increase our productivity and may lose  or not successfully recruit and retain key sales  technical or other personnel 
competition is intense and may adversely impact our profit margin 
customers have many options for data storage products and services 
in january  we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with midrange computer systems inc mcsi  a storage consulting  solutions and service provider based in chicago  illinois 
we believe the acquisition has strengthened our presence in existing regional markets and expanded our reach into a number of key new regional markets 
we paid a purchase price of approximately million for mcsi  consisting of million cash and  shares of our common stock 
our results of operations for reflect the addition of mcsi for eleven months 
results of operations we ended with a record backlog of million  which represents firm orders expected to be recognized as revenue in the next days 
however  we are seeing the negative impact of the worldwide economic downturn affect many of our customers  resulting in greater scrutiny given to storage spending projects and providing us with less visibility into their purchasing plans 
we have also had some customers decide to significantly delay the implementation of projects for which they have already purchased and paid for the product 
we cannot predict what impact these economic uncertainties will have on our profitability going forward 
our sales for increased million or to million for as compared to our gross margin increased million or to million for as compared to our earnings from operations increased million from million in to million in the following table shows  for the periods indicated  certain selected financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative engineering integration costs amortization of intangibles total operating expenses operating earnings comparison of years ended december   and the following table shows  for the periods indicated  revenue and gross profit information for our product and service sales 
years ended december  product sales service sales product gross profit service gross profit product gross profit as a percentage of product sales service gross profit as a percentage of service sales net sales 
our product sales increased in from to million  and increased in from to million 
our service sales  which includes customer support  consulting and installation services  increased in from to million  and increased in from to million 
the modest increase in our product sales in as compared to is primarily from the successful integration of mcsi and increased storage spending in the marketplace 
in addition  our product revenues continue to reflect our customers closer scrutiny of expenditures as they focus more attention on the actual or anticipated impact that current economic conditions may have on the growth and profitability of their business 
the increase in our product sales in as compared to is primarily due to the acquisition of mcsi in january product sales growth decreased from in to in and in continuing to reflect what we believe to be a slow down in it and storage spending with some of our larger customers  as they have become more cautious about the economy and their individual growth prospects 
this has created longer sales cycles with a number of large project delays 
we believe that this spending slow down among our customers will continue in the increase in our service revenues for over and over reflects an increase in our customer support contract revenues and installation and configuration service revenues 
for  customer support contract revenues increased million or over and installation and configuration service revenues increased million or 
for customer support contract revenues increased million or over and installation and configuration service revenues increased million or 
for  the slow down in the growth of our customer support and installation and configuration services is due to both the acquisition of mcsi in and the slow down in the growth of our product revenues 
we expect to see flat to declining customer support and installation and configuration services in as spending on product declines due to current economic conditions 
the majority of our increase in customer support contract revenues in was due to the acquisition of mcsi 
we derived approximately of our sales from our customer  at t inc  during we do not expect that this customer will account for a substantial portion of our future sales 
we had no customers that comprised more than of our sales in or gross profit 
our total gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in increasing from in and in product gross profit as a percentage of product sales increased to in as compared to and decreased to in as compared to in our product gross profit as a percentage of product sales is impacted by the mix and type of projects we complete for our customers 
our product gross profit as a percentage of product sales increased for over due to the continuing efforts by our sales force to sell higher margin storage solutions 
this included the increased percentage of our product sales coming from disk sales which have historically experienced higher margins 
with the current economic downturn  we expect a decline in the number and profitability of disk sales 
our product gross profit as a percentage of product sales decreased for over due to the additional mcsi revenues which historically had lower product margins 
our efforts to successfully integrate the mcsi sales force  by leveraging product and service offerings across our vendors  has gradually improved the gross margins realized by the mcsi sales force 
we have various programs in place with our vendors that provide economic incentives for achieving various sales performance targets 
achieving these targets contributed favorably to our product gross profit by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these vendor incentive programs constantly change and we negotiate them separately with each vendor 
while we expect the incentive programs to continue  the vendors could modify or discontinue them  particularly in light of current economic conditions  which would unfavorably impact our product gross profit margins 
we estimate that our product gross margins will be approximately to going forward 
service gross profit as a percentage of service sales was in as compared to in and in in  we had  less in mcsi acquisition purchase accounting adjustments that required us to reduce revenues and corresponding margins to reflect the fair value of acquired maintenance contracts 
accordingly  for  our gross profit percentage of service sales returned to our historical range of between and 
the percentage decrease in as compared to is primarily due to a  reduction in revenues and corresponding margins for the mcsi acquisition to reflect the fair value of maintenance contracts we acquired 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include wages and commissions paid to sales and marketing personnel  travel costs and advertising  promotion and hiring expenses 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million  or of net sales for as compared to million  or of net sales for and million  or of net sales for the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars for over is primarily a result of higher commission expense of million which is due to our increase in revenues for the year 
the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars for over is primarily a result of higher commission expense of million and compensation expense of million 
the increase in commission expense is due to our increase in revenues for the year 
the increase in compensation expense is due to our acquisition of mcsi which increased our sales and marketing headcount by approximately 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales from to reflects better leverage of our fixed costs as revenues increased in the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales from to reflects primarily the increase in sales and marketing headcount as a result of our mcsi acquisition  and investments in sales management 
as we continue to selectively hire additional outside sales representatives  our sales and marketing expenses may increase without a commensurate increase in sales 
we are carefully monitoring our travel and other sales and marketing expenses in light of current economic conditions 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include wages for administrative personnel  professional fees  depreciation  communication expenses and rent and related facility expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales for compared to million  or of net sales for and million  or in the modest increase in general and administrative expense in absolute dollars for as compared to is primarily due to an increase in variable compensation expense of  related to exceeding performance objectives 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars for as compared to is primarily due to an increase in facility expenses of  with the acquisition of mcsi in january  an increase in audit fees and outside consulting fees for sarbanes oxley compliance of  an increase in compensation expense of  and an increase in depreciation expense of  our general and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of net sales for as compared to  and as compared to  primarily due to more controlled spending coupled with an increase in revenues 
engineering 
engineering expenses include employee wages and travel  hiring and training expenses for our field and customer support engineers and technicians 
we allocate engineering costs associated with installation and configuration services and with consulting services to our cost of service sales 
therefore  if we incur a slowdown in product sales during because of current economic conditions  we will have higher engineering expenses 
engineering expenses increased to million  or of net sales in compared to million  or of net sales in and million  or of net sales in the increase in engineering expenses in absolute dollars for over is due primarily to an increase in compensation expense of million for additional regional and customer support resources and an increase in variable compensation expense of  related to exceeding performance objectives 
the increase in engineering expenses in absolute dollars for over is due primarily to an increase in compensation expense of million related to our mcsi acquisition 
the mcsi acquisition increased our engineering headcount approximately 
the increase in engineering expenses as a percentage of sales for as compared to and as compared to is primarily the result of investments in regional engineering support  regional management and customer support resources 
integration costs 
we had integration expenses of  in related to the january  acquisition of mcsi 
integration expenses include salaries and benefits of mcsi employees who assisted with the initial integration but whom we ultimately did not retain  together with retention bonuses and severance payments 
intangible amortization 
we had expenses related to the amortization of finite lived intangible assets of   and in  and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to  in from  in due to the amortization of backlog which was completed in amortization of intangible assets increased to  in from in the increase in finite lived intangible assets and subsequent amortization is due to our acquisition of mcsi on january  the finite lived intangibles we acquired  consisting of customer relationships and backlog  have estimated lives of six years and two months  respectively  and we are amortizing them using the straight line method 
for  and  we determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we are required to assess the carrying amount of our finite life intangibles and goodwill for potential impairment annually or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
the assessment to determine if a potential impairment of goodwill exists involves comparing our market capitalization to the carrying value of our net assets 
historically  our market capitalization has been well above the carrying value of our net assets and there has been no indication of potential impairment 
however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal the price of our common stock was significantly impacted by the volatility in the us equity markets 
the price of our common stock reached a low of during the fourth quarter of fiscal  remained below per share for an extended period of time during the fourth quarter of and closed at on december  these lows in the price of our common stock have coincided with the stock markets week lows recorded as the financial crisis has intensified 
as of december  our market capitalization was approximately million as compared to our stockholders equity at december  of million 
we believe that the fair value of our company exceeds our market capitalization because our fair value should include a control premium 
a control premium is the amount that a buyer is willing to pay over the current market price of a company as indicated by the traded price per share ie market capitalization  in order to acquire a controlling interest 
the premium is justified by the expected synergies  such as the expected increase in cash flow resulting from cost savings and revenue enhancements 
we believe a control premium of to percent is appropriate for our company 
applying a control premium of to percent results in a revised market capitalization of approximately million to million  respectively  which is in excess of our stockholders equity at december  of million and indicates there is not an impairment of goodwill as of december  however  we can provide no assurance that these continuing conditions would not trigger goodwill impairment testing in the future or whether we may record an impairment charge 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill to determine whether interim asset impairment testing is warranted 
since december   our stock price has fluctuated between a low of per share to a high of per share 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we are required to perform an impairment test for long lived assets on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses 
for  and  we determined that our long lived assets were not impaired 
operating earnings 
we realized operating earnings of million in  million in and million in the increase in our operating earnings in as compared to is a result of higher revenues and gross margins partially offset by higher operating expenses 
the decrease in our operating earnings in as compared to is due to our lower gross margin and increased operating expenses in primarily as a result of our acquisition of mcsi 
income taxes 
we had income tax expense of million in which resulted in our estimated effective tax rate of 
we had income tax expense of  in which resulted in our estimated effective tax rate of 
we had an income tax benefit of million in prior to fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the realization and timing of the benefits from those deferred tax assets as we had not achieved a sufficient level of sustained profitability 
during  we utilized approximately million of our net operating loss carryforwards 
furthermore  we concluded that we had attained a sufficient level of sustained profitability to reverse the remaining million valuation allowance 
we utilized approximately million and million of our federal net operating loss carryforwards in and  respectively 
as of december   we fully utilized our federal net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december  we have state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  which are available to offset future state taxable income 
if not used  these state net operating loss carryforwards will expire between and for  and  respectively  we recorded approximately   and  to equity for tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options 
in future periods of taxable earnings  we expect to report an income tax provision using an effective tax rate of approximately 
quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly financial data for each quarter of and we have prepared this unaudited information on the same basis as the audited information 
in our opinion  we have made all adjustments including all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth below

in thousands net sales gross profit operating earnings loss net earnings loss we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  quarterly variations in our net sales as a result of a number of factors  including the length of the sales cycle with customers for large storage system evaluations and purchases  delays in storage system installations or configurations  new product introductions by suppliers and their market acceptance  delays in product shipments or other quality control difficulties  trends in the enterprise class information storage industry in general or the geographic and industry specific markets in which we are currently active  or may be in the future 
in addition  current economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions to place or delay orders with us  and the size and scale of their orders 
further  our success in integrating any acquired business or in opening any new field offices could impact our operating results 
liquidity and capital resources since our initial public offering we have financed our operations and capital requirements through cash flows generated from operations 
our working capital was million at december  as compared to million at december  our current ratio was at december  and at december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as compared to cash and cash equivalents of million at december  cash provided by operating activities for was million 
cash provided by operating activities for was primarily impacted by net earnings for the year of million 
a net  increase in deferred customer support contracts 
while we amortize the revenues from these contracts over the life of the contract  the customer typically pays for the contracts at the beginning of the contract period which favorably impacts our cash flows 
a net decrease in working capital accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable of million reflecting increased sales activity over the prior year 
a non cash charge of million for depreciation and amortization of intangibles 
cash provided by operating activities for was million

a net decrease in working capital accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable of million reflecting increased sales activity during the fourth quarter of cash provided by operating activities for was million 
cash provided by operating activities for was primarily impacted by net earnings for the year of million 
a net million increase in deferred customer support contracts 
while we amortize the revenues from these contracts over the life of the contract  the customer typically pays for the contracts at the beginning of the contract period which favorably impacts our cash flows 
a million increase in accounts receivable reflecting increasing sales activity over the prior year 
a million increase in deferred income taxes resulting from the reversal of our valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
cash provided by investing activities was  in cash used in investing activities was million in and  in in  we had proceeds from the sale of short term investments of million offset by purchases of  for upgraded computer equipment  upgraded telephone systems and leasehold improvements 
in  we used this cash primarily for the acquisition of mcsi  purchase of a short term investment  and leasehold improvements and upgraded computer equipment 
in  we used cash primarily to purchase computer equipment and provide further enhancements to our business reporting tools 
cash used in financing activities in was  primarily for the redemption of restricted shares for tax withholding payments 
cash provided by financing activities in and was  and million  respectively  all of which we received from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
we have an eleven year non cancelable operating lease for our corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota which expires in the lease requires annual base rental payments of approximately million 
in december  we agreed to sublease approximately  of the  square feet we then occupied 
the initial term of the sublease is co terminal with our lease and is for months starting in april and ending in april the sublease requires rent payments ranging from  per month at the beginning of the term to approximately  per month by the end of the term 
for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
on january   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with midrange computer systems inc mcsi  a storage consulting  solutions and service provider based in chicago  illinois 
we paid approximately million for mcsi  consisting of million cash and  shares of our common stock 
we believe that our current cash balance and funds generated from operations will finance our current operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we believe if the need should arise to borrow funds  we could obtain a secured facility 
however  the current state of the financial markets could impact our ability to obtain future funding 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   our contractual cash obligations consist of future minimum lease payments due under non cancelable operating leases as follows lease obligations sublease agreements net lease obligations in thousands thereafter from time to time we enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers under customary purchase order terms 
we would recognize any significant losses implicit in these contracts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
at december   no such losses existed 
in december  we agreed to sublease approximately  of the  square feet we then occupied as our corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota 
the initial sublease term is co terminal with our lease and is months starting in april and ending in april the sublessee pays us rent ranging from approximately  per month at the beginning of the term to approximately  per month by the end of the term 
the rent includes the costs of common area management  common systems repairs  real estate taxes and standard utilities 
we are planning for  to million of capital expenditures during primarily related to enhancements to our management information systems and upgraded computer equipment 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported earnings 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe are reasonable 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the areas of customer receivables  inventories  investments  income taxes  self insurance reserves and commitments and contingencies 
we believe that the following represent the areas where we use more critical estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements inventory valuation 
we periodically review  estimate and adjust our reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the inventory cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
results could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions  length of industry downturn  or if products become obsolete because of technical advancements in the industry 
valuation of goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests an impairment exists 
testing for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step screens for potential impairment and if there is an indication of possible impairment we must complete the second step to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of our market capitalization with the carrying value of our net assets 
if our total market capitalization is at or below the carrying value of our net assets  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss we record  if any 
with the worldwide decline in stock prices  the potential for this is increased 
we consider goodwill impairment test estimates critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts 
valuation of long lived assets  including finite lived intangibles 
we evaluate long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
we base the evaluation on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the underlying assets 
the downturn in the us economy may make it increasingly difficult for us to accurately predict our future cash flows 
to the extent our projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related assets  we record a charge to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
we consider the estimates associated with the asset impairment tests critical due to the judgments required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
stock based compensation 
we adopted the provisions of fasb no 
r  share based payment on january  sfas r requires us to measure and recognize in our statements of operations the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
sfas r requires the use of an option pricing model to determine the fair value of share based payment awards 
our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables  will affect our determination of fair value 
we base recognition of compensation expense for our performance based  non vested shares on management s estimate of the probable outcome of the performance condition 
management reassesses the probability of meeting these performance conditions on a quarterly basis 
changes in management s estimate of meeting these performance conditions may result in significant fluctuations in compensation expense from period to period 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which provides guidance on how to measure assets and liabilities that use fair value 
sfas applies whenever another us gaap standard requires or permits measurement of assets or liabilities at fair value  but does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
we also adopted fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which allows us to partially defer the adoption of sfas this fsp defers the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities include all assets and liabilities other than those meeting the definition of a financial asset or financial liability as defined in paragraph of statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
the adoption of sfas no 
and fsp no 
had no impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and for disclosure to enable evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for us as to business combinations we make beginning in accordingly  until january   we recorded and disclose any business combinations we engage in by following existing gaap 
we are evaluating the impact of sfas no 
r  but do not currently expect it to have a significant impact on our financial statements when effective 
however  the nature and magnitude of the specific future effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of any acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas introduces significant changes in the accounting and reporting for business acquisitions and noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary 
sfas also changes the accounting and reporting for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
companies are required to adopt the new standard for fiscal years beginning after january  we adopted this standard as of january  and do not expect it to have an impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued staff position fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp fas 
the fsp amends the factors considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the fsp s intent is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under other accounting principles generally accepted in the us companies must adopt the fsp for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  early adoption is prohibited 
companies must apply the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
companies must also apply certain disclosure requirements prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of  and subsequent to  the effective date 
we adopted this standard as of january  and do not expect it to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years 
we cannot assure you that inflation will not adversely affect our business in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we do not believe that we have any material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required 
the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had million of cash and money market accounts and million of short term investments consisting primarily of certificates of deposit 
a decrease in market rates of interest would have no material effect on the value of these assets or the related interest income due to the nature of money market accounts 
we have no short or long term debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we market and sell all of our products and services in the united states 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
equity price risk 
we do not own any equity investments 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct equity price risk
