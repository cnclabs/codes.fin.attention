table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  investments  valuation of deferred tax assets  restructuring costs  contingencies  inventory valuation  warranty accrual and stock based compensation expense 
in conjunction with acquisitions  we allocate investment costs based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments or estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
a provision for estimated product returns is established at the time of sale based upon historical return rates adjusted for current economic conditions 
historically  we have experienced an insignificant amount of sales returns 
we generally recognize revenue when goods are shipped to our distributors in accordance with standard contract terms that pass title of all goods upon delivery to a common carrier fob factory and provides for sales returns under standard product warranty provisions 
for non standard contract terms where title to goods passes at time of delivery fob destination  revenue is recognized after we have established proof of delivery 
revenues relating to services performed under our extended warranty program represent less than of net revenues in each of  and and are recognized as earned based upon contract terms  generally ratable over the term of service 
we record project installation work in asia using the percentage of completion method 
installation revenue represents less than of net revenue in  and net revenues include amounts billed to customers in sales transactions for shipping and handling  as prescribed by the emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
shipping fees represent less than of net revenues in each of  and shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold 
accounts receivable  trade notes receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we grant credit to our customers after undertaking an investigation of credit risk for all significant amounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for estimated credit losses at a level deemed appropriate to adequately provide for known and inherent risks related to such amounts 
the allowance is based on reviews of loss  adjustments history  current economic conditions and other factors that deserve recognition in estimating potential losses 
we generally do not require collateral for sales on credit 
while management uses the best information available in making our determination  the ultimate recovery of recorded accounts receivable is also dependent upon future economic and other conditions that may be beyond management s control 
if there was a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or if actual defaults were higher than what have been experienced historically  additional allowances would be required 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial stability of our customers 
any material change in the financial status of any one or a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
trade notes receivables are presented to us from some of our customers in china as a payment against the outstanding trade receivables 
these notes receivables are bank guarantee promissory notes which are non interest bearing and generally mature within months 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or market 
we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage  or saleable only for amounts that are less than their carrying amounts 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in the market  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
we have established inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
when recorded  reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of the inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for specified products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional reserves may be required 
goodwill we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value according to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
we have one reporting unit and have tested goodwill for impairment on the basis of a single reporting unit 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on our short term and long term projections of the future performance 
the assumptions supporting our estimated future performances includes factors related to estimating the market value based on our market capitalization at the measurement dates 
long lived assets we test long lived asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amounts of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset  as well as specific appraisals in certain instances 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  where the fair value of each option is adjusted to reflect only those shares that are expected to vest 
we made the following estimates and assumptions in determining fair value valuation and amortization method we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton option pricing formula and a single option award approach 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
expected term our expected term represents the weighted average period that our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
prior to  we applied the simplified method as defined in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
from the first quarter of  we have used the historical exercise patterns of previously granted options in relation to the company s stock price to estimate expected exercise patterns 
expected volatility the company s expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company s stock  adjusted where determined by management for unusual and non representative stock price activity not expected to recur 

table of contents expected dividend the black scholes merton valuation model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input 
the company currently pays no dividends and does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
risk free interest rate the company bases the risk free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
estimated forfeitures to estimate forfeitures  we apply our historical rate of option forfeitures 
estimated forfeiture rates are trued up to actual forfeiture results as the stock based awards vest 
business combinations in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  acquired developed technologies and pending patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates  foreign losses not benefited  stock compensation expenses under sfas r which are not deductible for tax purposes and valuation allowance 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
results of operations net sales percentage percentage change change change change in thousands net sales net sales for increased million or from million in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in net sales of million and million in the americas and europe  respectively  offset by a decrease of net sales in asia by million 
approximately million of the total increase was due to the 
table of contents appreciation of the renminbi rmb and euro against the us dollar from to the remainder of the increase was mainly due to a million contract with the united states national guard for arearae wireless rapid deployment kits to equip all civil support teams throughout the united states and its territories and increases in sales for new products such as qrae ii  toxirae iii  g pid and arearae mainly in europe  offset by a volume decline in china from mine safety equipment sales and a general sales slow down following the beijing olympics in the second half of net sales for increased million or from million in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in net sales of million from the acquisition of rae fushun in december and an increase in net sales of million in the americas  million in europe and million in the rest of asia excluding fushun 
the increase in revenue was primarily due to overall greater market penetration by the sales team  which led to higher government orders in the united states and larger sales to oil and steel industries in china

sales and marketing expense percentage percentage change change change change in thousands sales and marketing percentage of net sales sales and marketing expenses in decreased million or from million in the decrease was primarily due to company wide cost control initiatives and ten percent reduction in force primarily in the americas that were put in place at the end of the first quarter of additional savings were realized by decreases in office expenses  advertising and trade show expenses  travel and entertainment expenses  consultant expenses and project expenses 
sales and marketing expenses in increased million or from million in the increase was primarily due to a million increase in payroll and benefit related expenses  as a result of headcount increases in all regions and headcount increases from the acquisition of rae fushun in december  as well as million of increased travel and entertainment expenses and million of increased office and facility expenses 
in addition  commission expenses increased by million reflecting an increase in revenue

table of contents research and development expense percentage percentage change change change change in thousands research and development percentage of net sales research and development expenses in decreased million or from million in the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in amortization expense as certain intangible assets were fully amortized and a million decrease in project expenses due to completion of certain r d projects in research and development expenses in increased million or from million in the increase was primarily due to a million increase in payroll and benefit related expenses  as a result of headcount increases in china  and from the acquisition of rae fushun in december  as well as million increase in office and travel expenses 
project expenses increased by million mainly due to increases in product certifications and testing expenses and additional projects from the formation of rae fushun as well as new projects related to future products in other regions 
we also impaired certain patents of approximately million in china as related products had reached end of life and were discontinued 
general and administrative expense percentage percentage change change change change in thousands general and administrative percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses in increased million or from in the increase was primarily due to a net increase of million in professional service expenses 
the charge was comprised of million increase related to a previously disclosed fcpa investigation and related remediation plans conducted under the supervision of the audit committee of the board of directors  offset by a decrease in legal costs associated with the conclusion of the polimaster arbitration in bad debt expenses increased by million due to an increase in accounts receivable reserves at rae fushun and rae beijing

the increase of million in professional fees is primarily comprised of million increase in legal costs associated with the polimaster arbitration  million increase in accounting and tax services related to the international nature of our business  offset by million decrease in consulting fees where permanent positions have replaced consultants 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is offset by a million gain recognized as a result of the sale and leaseback of our san jose headquarters building in december impairment of goodwill percentage percentage change change change change in thousands impairment of goodwill percentage of net sales we review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred 
recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit  which is measured based upon  among other factors  market capitalization as well as forecasted operating results 
we have one reporting unit 
if the recorded value of the assets  including goodwill  and liabilities 
table of contents net book value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss may exist 
further  to the extent our net book value as a whole is greater than our market capitalization  all  or a significant portion of our goodwill may be considered impaired 
we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization during the fourth quarter of this decline in market capitalization was driven largely by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions that contributed to a decline in our forecasted operating results and business uncertainties associated with the current fcpa investigation 
as a result  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of approximately million for the three month period and year ended december  to write off the entire carrying value of our goodwill 
gain loss on abandonment of lease percentage percentage change change change change in thousands gain loss on abandonment of lease percentage of net sales income on abandonment of lease in was million 
in march  we revised the estimated loss on abandonment of the lease related to our former headquarters in sunnyvale  california and reduced operating expenses by million 
the change in estimate primarily reflected management s expectation that the premises would be subleased under current market conditions for office rentals 
during the second quarter of  a sublease was executed with rents commencing in june 
other income expense percentage percentage change change change change in thousands interest income interest expense other  net total other income expense for  total other expenses increased million or from million in the increase was primarily due to increases in foreign exchange losses from balances and payments in euro and rmb  offset by decreases in interest expenses as we repaid our outstanding loan balance using funds from sale of the san jose building 
for  total other income decreased million or from million in the decrease was primarily the result of lower interest income as we made substantial investments in rae fushun  securay and aegison corporation during the second half of and through in addition  interest expenses increased by million due to short term bank borrowings in the us and china to support operations 
other income decreased by million mainly due to realized foreign exchange loss from payments to fushun shareholders in income tax benefit expense percentage percentage change change change change in thousands income tax expense benefit effective tax rate income tax expense decreased million or from an income tax expense of million in our effective tax rate was in and in the tax rate for years and differed from united states statutory rate due to change in the realization of our deferred tax assets dtas  foreign earnings taxed at lower rates  foreign losses not benefited and non deductible stock compensation deductions under sfas and sfas r 

table of contents we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from anticipated net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences  which will reduce taxable income in future periods 
we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance for all deferred assets except for million related to foreign entities 
based on our current projections  we believe it is more likely than not we will not be able to benefit from our deferred tax assets with the exception of the million foreign deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized and that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
therefore  cumulative losses weighed heavily in the overall assessment 
we believe that sufficient uncertainty exists with regard to the realizability of these tax assets such that a valuation allowance is necessary 
factors considered in providing a valuation allowance include the lack of a significant history of consistent profits  the current and believed to be continued weakness in the overall market thereby potentially impacting our ability to sustain or grow revenues and earnings  and the length of carryback and carryforward periods 
we considered expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
based on the absence of sufficient positive objective verifiable evidence at december   we have placed a valuation on our deferred tax assets except for million of foreign deferred tax assets 
we expect to record a valuation allowance on future tax benefits until we can sustain an appropriate level of profitability and until such time  we would not expect to recognize any significant tax benefits in our future results of operations 
our effective tax rate was a tax expense in and tax benefit in the tax rate for and differed from the united states statutory rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates  foreign losses not benefited  non deductible stock compensation deductions under sfas and sfas r and adjustments to our reserves for uncertain tax positions

our mobile dvr business was acquired through the purchases of aegison and securay 
see note mergers and acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details 
on august   we notified our dvr customers  terminated all personnel not reassigned to continuing operations and suspended the related production and sales activities 
because the dvr business operates at a substantial loss  management intends to liquidate the tangible assets  mainly inventories of component parts 
accordingly  the value of these assets has been adjusted to reflect the anticipated disposals 
as a result of discontinuing the dvr business  management impaired the remaining value of the intangible assets and goodwill acquired in the purchases of aegison in july and securay in january impairment expense recognized in fiscal totaled million 

table of contents in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  the financial results of the dvr business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the financial results included in discontinued operations were as follows percentage percentage change change change change in thousands loss from discontinued operations before income taxes income tax benefit loss from discontinued operations liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through operating revenues  proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and short term bank borrowings 
in  we also sold and leased back our corporate headquarters in san jose  california

on december  we had million in working capital current assets less current liabilities and a current ratio ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of to on december  in the united states  we had a million revolving credit agreement as of december  and december  this credit facility is renewed annually and currently expires on march  we are currently renegotiating the terms of this line of credit with our bank and on march   we received an extension on our existing line to may  which also changed certain other terms and conditions 
the amended credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to million based on a percentage of specific qualifying assets and a blanket security interest in our assets in the united states 
we are required to comply with certain reporting requirements in addition to the ongoing requirement to submit quarterly financial statements 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in securing a renewed agreement on this line of credit for any time period after may  as of december  and december   million and zero  respectively  was outstanding against these loan agreements in the united states 
one of our financial covenants was the requirement to achieve earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of at least million for the period from july  to december  primarily due to the effect on our net sales from the sharp global economic downturn during the fourth quarter  we were not in compliance with this covenant  however  our bank has provided a waiver for the noncompliance 
notwithstanding the loss from continuing operations in  we generated cash from operating activities of million 
in china  we had two unsecured revolving lines of credit as of december  and december   each in the amount of rmb million or approximately million 
at year end  we also maintained an unsecured line of credit in the amount of rmb million or approximately million 
borrowings under these lines of credit are available to provide working capital and are generally at the current market rate for fixed rate loans of the amount and duration requested  up to one year 
the continuing credit facilities are renewed annually in may and october  respectively 
as of december  and december   rmb million or approximately million and rmb million or approximately million  respectively  was outstanding against loan agreements in china 
we believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents  together with cash generated from product sales  will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict  including the size  timing and structure of any future acquisitions  future capital investments  the ultimate resolution of issues arising from our internal investigation regarding potential fcpa violations and future results of operations

 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework  or hierarchy  for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles for nongovernmental entities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk concentration of credit risk currently  we have cash and cash equivalents deposited with major financial institutions in the countries where we conduct business 
our deposits may exceed the amount of insurance available to cover such deposits 
to date  we have not experienced any losses of deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
management regularly reviews our deposit amounts and the credit worthiness of the financial institution which hold our deposits 
interest rate risk as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
changes to interest rates over time may reduce or increase our interest income from our short term investments but the impact on our cash and cash equivalents is expected to be insignificant 
foreign currency exchange rate risk for the year ended december   a substantial portion of our recognized revenue was denominated in us dollars generated primarily from customers in the americas 
revenue generated from our european operations was primarily in euros  revenue generated by our asia operations was primarily in rmb 
we manufacture a majority of our component parts at our manufacturing facility in shanghai  china 
since january  our operations in china have been affected by currency fluctuations due to an approximate appreciation of the rmb relative to the us dollar 
our strategy has been and will continue to be to increase our overseas manufacturing and research and development activities to capitalize on lower cost capacity and efficiencies in supply chain management 
in and  we made a strategic investment in china with the acquisition of a interest in rae beijing  a beijing based manufacturer and distributor of environmental safety and security equipment and the formation of rae fushun in late to capitalize on increase in demand for safety equipment in the mining and energy sectors in china 
there has been continued speculation in the financial press that china s currency  the rmb  will be subject to a further market adjustment relative to the us dollar and other currencies 
if  for example  there was a hypothetical change in the rmb relative to the us dollar  the effect on our profits would have been approximately million for fiscal if the currencies in all other countries in europe and asia where we have 
table of contents operations to change in unison with the rmb by a hypothetical against the us dollar  the approximate effect on our profits would be approximately million for fiscal the reduction in the impact of the rmb is due to the offset of changes in reported net sales in our other units resulting from changes in those countries local currencies 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars in countries other than china  any fluctuation in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could affect our competitive position in the international markets 
although we would continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot be certain that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future
