item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this md a should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements which have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  our recurring losses from operations and deteriorating cash flow raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
see  also  risk factors 
our business and results of operations are substantially dependent upon the demand for ate by semiconductor manufacturers and companies that specialize in the testing of ics 
demand for ate is driven by semiconductor manufacturers that are opening new  or expanding existing  semiconductor fabrication facilities or upgrading existing equipment  which in turn is dependent upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
in the past  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply  which often have a severe impact on the semiconductor industry s demand for ate  including the products we manufacture 
this can cause wide fluctuations in both our orders and net revenues and  depending on our ability to react quickly to these shifts in demand  can significantly impact our results of operations 
these industry cycles are difficult to predict and in recent years have become more volatile and  in most cases  shorter in duration 
because the industry cycles are generally characterized by sequential periods of growth or declines in orders and net revenues during each cycle  year over year comparisons of operating results may not always be as meaningful as comparisons of periods at similar points in either up or down cycles 
in addition  during both downward and upward cycles in our industry  in any given quarter  the trend in both our orders and net revenues can be erratic 
this can occur  for example  when orders are canceled or currently scheduled delivery dates are accelerated or postponed by a significant customer or when customer forecasts and general business conditions fluctuate during a quarter 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during the second half of  the deterioration in the global economy had a significant negative impact on the demand for ate 
while all of our product segments experienced declines in the demand for their products during the second half of  some experienced greater reductions in demand than others 
our mechanical products formerly known as manipulator and docking hardware and electrical products formerly known as tester interface segments both experienced declining bookings throughout  however the reductions in the second half of the year were more significant 
the declines in bookings between the first quarter and the fourth quarter of were in the mechanical products segment and in the electrical products segment 
these declines continued into the first quarter of  with mechanical products and electrical products segment s bookings down and  respectively  from the first quarter of we believe the significant declines in the bookings of both of these segment s is due to the reduction in demand for ate resulting from falling ate utilization rates at our customers  who have experienced weakened demand for their products due to the global economic recession 
our thermal products formerly known as temperature management segment experienced increased bookings in the first half of and then reduced bookings in the second half of the year 
the fourth quarter bookings for the thermal products segment  adjusted to eliminate the impact of the acquisition of sigma systems which was acquired in october  declined from the second quarter of this trend continued into the first quarter of  with thermal products segment bookings  adjusted to eliminate the impact of sigma  down from the second quarter of we believe the lower level of declines experienced by the thermal products segment reflect the diversification of industries outside semiconductor served by the thermal products segment 
we believe that purchases of most of our products are typically made from semiconductor manufacturers capital expenditure budgets 
certain portions of our business  however  are generally less dependent upon the capital expenditure budgets of the end users 
for example  purchases of certain related ate interface products  such as sockets and interface boards  which must be replaced periodically  are typically made from the end users operating budgets 
in addition  purchases of certain of our products  such as docking hardware  for the purpose of upgrading or improving the utilization  performance and efficiency of existing ate  tend to be counter cyclical to sales of new ate 
moreover  we believe a portion of our sales of thermal products results from the increasing need for temperature testing of circuit boards and specialized components that do not have the design or quantity to be tested in an electronic device handler 
in addition  in recent years we have begun to market our thermostream temperature ma nagement systems in industries outside semiconductor test  such as the automotive  aerospace  medical and telecommunications industries 
we believe that these industries usually are less cyclical than the ate industry 
while the majority of our orders and net revenues are derived from the ate market  our operating results do not always follow the overall trend in the ate market in any given period 
we believe that these anomalies may be driven by a variety of changes within the ate market  including  for example  changing product requirements  longer time periods between new product offerings by oems and changes in customer buying patterns 
in particular  demand for our mechanical and electrical products  which are sold exclusively within the ate industry  and our operating margins in these product segments have been affected by shifts in the competitive landscape  including i customers placing heightened emphasis on shorter lead times which places increased demands on our available engineering and production capacity increasing unit costs and ordering in smaller quantities which prevents us from acquiring component materials in larger volumes at lower cost and increasing unit costs  ii the increasing practice of o em manufacturers to specify other suppliers as primary vendors  with less frequent opportunities to compete for such designations  iii the increased role of third party test and assembly houses in the ate market and their requirement of products with a greater range of use at the lowest cost  and iv customer supply line management groups demanding lower prices and spreading purchases across multiple vendors 
these shifts in market practices have had  and may continue to have  varying levels of impact on our operating results  but it is difficult to quantify the impact of these practices from period to period 
management has taken  and will continue to take  such actions it deems appropriate to adjust our strategies  products and operations to counter such shifts in market practices as they become evident 
net revenues and orders the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a breakdown of the net revenues from unaffiliated customers both by product segment and geographic area based on the location of the selling entity 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december  net revenues from unaffiliated customers mechanical products thermal products electrical products intersegment sales intersegment sales mechanical products thermal products electrical products net revenues from unaffiliated customers net of intersegment sales mechanical products thermal products electrical products net revenues from unaffiliated customers us europe asia pacific our consolidated net revenues for the year ended december  decreased million or as compared to the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our mechanical products and thermal products segments decreased and  respectively  during as compared to  while the net revenues of our electrical products segment increased during as compared to the prior year 
adjusted to exclude the net revenues of sigma systems corp 
sigma which we acquired in october as further discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  our consolidated net revenues would have decreased by million or and the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our thermal products segment  in which the results of sigma are included  would have decreased by in as compared to total orders for the year ended december  decreased to million on a consolidated basis as compared to million for for our mechanical products  thermal products and electrical products segments  total orders for were million  million and million  respectively  compared to million  million and million  respectively  for adjusted to exclude the orders of sigma  total consolidated orders for would have been million and total orders for our thermal products segment  would have been million in as compared to we believe that the decline in our net revenues and orders in reflects further declines in the level of demand in the ate market in as compared to  the deterioration in the global economy during the latter part of as well as many of the factors discussed in the overview 
both our mechanical products and electrical products segments continue to be significantly affected by the aforementioned shifts in the competitive landscape within the ate market  while our thermal products segment has been less impacted by these changes in demand as a result of our ability to successfully market our thermostream products outside the semiconductor industry 
in addition  sigma  which we acquired in october and which is included in our thermal products segment  sells to several markets outside the semiconductor industry 
in both and  approximately of our thermal products segment s net revenues were attributable to customers in markets outside of semiconductor test 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued while we experienced reduced levels of demand throughout in both our mechanical products and thermal products segments  all three of our segments experienced declines in demand during the second half of the year  and particularly in the fourth quarter of  which we believe reflects both the continued slowdown in demand in the ate market combined with the impact of the current global economic recession 
as a result of these significant declines in demand during the second half of  the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our mechanical products  thermal products excluding the net revenues of sigma and electrical products segments declined  and  respectively  during the second half of as compared to the first half of the year 
as previously mentioned  although our electrical products segment experienced a decline in net revenues during the second half of as compared to the first half of the year  for as a whole  the net revenues of our electrical products segment increased compared to we attribute the increase in the net revenues of our electrical products segment in as compared to primarily to a significantly higher level of orders during the first half of the year for certain new product designs which this segment had been developing in late and early for a particular oem customer 
in addition  the second quarter of also included several orders from this same customer for certain existing product designs sold by this segment 
the level of orders for both new and existing product designs from this customer in the third and fourth quarters of was significantly lower than the level experienced during the first half of furthermore  during the third quarter of  this customer indicated that they would not be placing any significant additional orders with any of their vendors for the time being 
we believe this action by our customer reflects both the impact of the continued reduction in demand in the ate market as well as the global economic crisis which has worsened in recent months 
during  our net revenues from customers in the us decreased 
after adjustment to eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  our net revenues from customers in europe and asia decreased and  respectively  during as compared to the larger percentage decrease in our net revenues from customers in europe primarily reflects lower demand experienced by our intestlogic operation in germany  which we announced our decision to close during the third quarter of the smaller percentage decrease in our net revenues from customers in asia primarily reflects increased sales during of third party products distributed by our operation in japan 
in the second half of  our net revenues from customers in asia had significantly declined  primarily as a result of the loss by our japanese operation of one of the third party product lines they had been distributing 
in  this operation found new distribution opportunities and began to see an increase in net r evenues as a result 
this increase in sales of third party products partially offset the decreases in the sales of our internally developed products and resulted in the smaller percentage decline from customers in this region in as compared to however  this operation began experiencing more significant operating losses in late due to the global recession  and  in april  we decided to close this operation  as more fully discussed under business restructuring initiatives below 
backlog at december   our backlog of unfilled orders for all products was approximately million compared with approximately million at december  our backlog includes customer orders which we have accepted  substantially all of which we expect to deliver in while backlog is calculated on the basis of firm purchase orders  a customer may cancel an order or accelerate or postpone currently scheduled delivery dates 
our backlog may be affected by the tendency of customers to rely on short lead times available from suppliers  including us  in periods of depressed demand 
in periods of increased demand  there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog 
as a result  our backlog at a particular date is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period 
business restructuring initiatives in early  we commenced a review of our operations to more aggressively streamline our cost structure in line with the current business environment 
as part of this process  we are focusing on methods to increase our profitability worldwide  including pursuing other types of revenue streams and additional growth opportunities 
the actions we have taken to date to reduce our operating cost structure are described below 
the review of our operations is on going 
in addition  in april  we retained a financial advisor to assist us in assessing our strategic alternatives to enhance operating performance and shareholder value 
under present market conditions and with our present resources  our goals remain to conserve cash  reduce costs and generate sales of our products 
we also continue to consider other alternatives  however  if we are not successful in intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued accomplishing these goals or alternatives  we may be forced to seek relief through a filing under the us bankruptcy code or liquidate and dissolve our business 
see risk factors 
we will likely incur additional restructuring charges in future periods  however  we cannot predict the amount of such charges at this time 
restructuring actions to date on january   we approved a reduction in workforce in our thermal products segment of employees  representing approximately of the total employees in this segment 
we incurred approximately  in total costs related to this action for one time termination benefits 
these costs were incurred in the first quarter of these actions were taken to reduce the operating expenses of this segment in response to current business conditions 
we completed the communication of these actions to our employees on january   and expect that the completed actions in this segment will reduce our annual operating expense structure by approximately  effective march   we implemented salary reductions in each of our three product segments by means of a one week furlough out of every four weeks in the case of the mechanical products and electrical products segments a reduction and a one week furlough each month in the case of the thermal products segment a reduction 
on april   we approved reductions in workforce in our mechanical products  thermal products and corporate segments of  and one employee  respectively  which represented  and  respectively  of the employees in each of these segments 
we will incur approximately  in total costs related to these actions for one time termination benefits 
these costs will be incurred in the second and third quarters of we also approved a reduction in the base salary of our executive chairman of approximately  we completed the communications of these actions to our employees on april  also on april   we approved the closure of our japanese operation  which is part of our mechanical products segment 
the four full time and one part time employees were notified of this planned closure on april  we have not yet determined the final termination dates for these employees or an estimate of the one time termination benefits and facility closure costs associated with the closure of our japanese operations 
on april   we approved reductions in workforce in our singaporean operation  which is also part of our mechanical products segment 
we plan to terminate employees and notified these employees of their planned termination on april  we have not yet determined the final termination dates for these employees  but we currently expect these actions to be completed by june  we currently estimate that we will incur approximately  in total costs related to this action for one time termination benefits 
we expect to incur these costs during the second and third quarters of in connection with this action  we plan to centralize manufacturing of manipulator and docking hardware products in our cherry hill  new jersey operation 
the reduction in force noted above for the mechanical products segment totaled employees  representing of the employees in this segment

on april  we terminated employees and an additional staff person was terminated on may   which represented of the employees in this segment 
we will incur approximately  in total costs related to these actions for one time termination benefits 
we expect to incur these costs during the second and third quarters of we currently expect that the completed actions taken in these segments and company wide in april will reduce our annual operating expenses by approximately million 
all of these actions were taken to further reduce our operating expenses in response to current business conditions 
in may  we modified the one week furloughs we implemented on march  in our mechanical products and electrical products segments  for employees earning over  annually we changed from a one week furlough in every four weeks to a temporary salary reduction 
in our thermal products segment  for employees earning over  annually we changed from a one week furlough per month to a temporary salary reduction 
in cases where the temporary salary reduction would reduce an employee s annual salary below  or where the temporary salary reduction would reduce an employee s annual salary below  we did not reduce the employee s annual salary below  or 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued mechanical products segment restructuring actions on june   we announced that we were reducing the workforce in our mechanical products segment by employees  representing of the total employees in this segment  and implementing a reduced work week for our manufacturing facility in amerang  germany the q mp workforce reduction 
the total costs incurred related to this action were  these costs represented one time termination benefits 
this action was completed in the third quarter of we expect that the completed q mp workforce reduction will reduce our annual operating expense structure by approximately million 
on september   we approved a restructuring plan for our mechanical products segment the q mp plan 
as a part of this plan  we permanently closed our manufacturing facility in amerang  germany and our engineering and sales office in the uk in addition to these facility closures  we reduced our domestic workforce by employees  which represented approximately of the total employees in this segment 
we also implemented temporary salary reductions for certain employees of this segment  temporarily reduced the fees paid to members of our board of directors and implemented permanent reductions for expenses related to our use of third party vendors 
effective january   we implemented additional temporary and permanent cost reductions associated with our employee benefit plans 
this includes the temporary suspension of our k matching contributions and the implementation of an employee contribution of a portion of the cost of medical coverage for our domestic employees in this segm ent 
the total costs incurred related to these actions were  which is made up of  for one time termination benefits and  for facility closure costs 
these actions were completed during the fourth quarter of we expect that the completed q mp plan will reduce our annual operating expense structure by approximately million 
on december   we approved a further reduction in workforce in our mechanical products segment of employees  representing approximately of the total employees in this segment the q mp plan 
we incurred approximately  in total costs related to this action for one time termination benefits 
these costs were incurred in the fourth quarter of in addition to the reduction in workforce  we reduced by the hours worked by three employees and reduced by the salary of two employees 
these actions were taken to reduce the operating expenses of this segment in response to continued operating losses 
these actions were completed during the fourth quarter of we expect that the completed q mp plan will reduce our annual operating expense structure by approximately  electrical products segment restructuring actions on september   we approved a restructuring plan for our electrical products segment the q ep plan 
as a part of this plan  we reduced our workforce by employees  which represented approximately of the total employees in this segment 
we also implemented temporary salary reductions for certain employees of this segment  and  effective january   we implemented additional temporary and permanent cost reductions associated with our employee benefit plans  similar to those discussed above for the q mp plan 
the total costs incurred related to this action were  which represented one time termination benefits 
this action was completed in the third quarter of we expect that the completed q ep plan will reduce our annual operating expense structure by approximately on november   we approved a further reduction in workforce in our electrical products segment of employees  representing approximately of the total employees in this segment the q ep plan 
we incurred  in total costs related to this action for one time termination benefits 
this action was taken to reduce the operating expenses of this segment in response to continued operating losses 
these actions were completed during the fourth quarter of we expect that the completed q ep plan will reduce our annual operating expense structure by approximately  impairment charges generally accepted accounting principles require us to perform at least an annual assessment for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets and to monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
at december   we had goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets which totaled million 
at december  we also had long lived assets which totaled million and consisted of finite lived intangible assets of  and property and equipment of  during and  we recorded intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impairment charges for goodwill of  and million  respectively 
during and  we recorded impairment charges related to long lived assets of million and  respectively 
please refer to note of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these charges 
acquisitions in july  we acquired the assets of diamond integration  llc  diamond a business that provides post warranty service for ate equipment to semiconductor manufacturers 
the total cost to acquire these assets was  the results of diamond are included in our mechanical products segment 
please see note of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for detail of the purchase price allocation 
as previously mentioned in the discussion of net revenues and orders  on october   we acquired sigma  a manufacturer of thermal platforms  custom configured environmental chambers and other environmental test solutions for a variety of industries including automotive  medical pharmaceutical  electronic  aerospace defense and ate 
sigma is included in our thermal products segment and has expanded our product offerings outside the ate market 
we believe sigma s products are highly complementary to our other thermal products and will greatly facilitate our further penetration into non ate markets 
the purchase price was approximately million and was paid with million in cash   shares of our common stock  and the issuance of non negotiable promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to million 
in addition  during the closing of the transaction we repaid  of debt on the books of sigma and incurred transaction costs of  please see note of the footnotes t o our consolidated financial statements for detail of the purchase price allocation 
excess and obsolete inventory charges on a quarterly basis  we review our inventories and record charges for excess and obsolete inventory based upon our established objective excess and obsolete inventory criteria 
these criteria identify material that has not been used in a work order during the prior twelve months and the quantity of material on hand that is greater than the average annual usage of that material over the prior three years 
in certain cases  additional excess and obsolete inventory charges are recorded based upon current industry conditions  anticipated product life cycles  new product introductions and expected future use of the inventory 
the excess and obsolete inventory charges we record establish a new cost basis for the related inventory 
see also the section entitled critical accounting policies 
we incurred charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the level of these charges was based upon a variety of factors  including changes in demand for our products and new product designs 
the increase in excess and obsolete inventory charges in and reflects the reduced demand for certain of our products  primarily in our mechanical products and electrical products segments 
see also the section entitled critical accounting policies 
during the years ended december   and we utilized   and  respectively  of material in production that had been written off as obsolete in prior periods 
when previously written off inventory material is used in production  it has a zero cost basis and as a result  has the impact of improving our gross margin in the period used 
for the years ended december   and  the use of previously obsoleted inventory materials did not materially change our gross margin 
product warranty charges we accrue product warranty charges quarterly  based upon our historical claims experience 
in addition  from time to time  we accrue additional amounts based upon known product warranty issues  such as product retrofits 
for the years ended december   and  our product warranty charges recoveries were   and  or  and of net revenues  respectively 
the downward trend in our product warranty charges has been driven by a number of factors including recent improvements in product quality 
in addition  warranty claims are typically highest when new products are introduced  and during these years there were no significant sales of newly introduced product families in our mechanical products segment 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the level of our product warranty charges both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues is affected by a number of factors including the cyclicality of demand in the ate industry  the prototype nature of much of our business  the complex nature of many of our products  the introduction of new product families which typically have higher levels of warranty claims than existing product families  and  at our discretion  providing warranty repairs or replacements to customers after the contracted warranty period has expired in order to promote strong customer relations 
see also critical accounting policies 
product customer mix our three product segments each have multiple products that we design  manufacture and sell to our customers 
the gross margin on each product we offer is impacted by a number of factors including the amount of intellectual property such as patents utilized in the product  the number of units ordered by the customer at one time  or the amount of intest designed and fabricated material included in our product compared with the amount of third party designed and fabricated material included in our product 
the weight of each of these factors  as well as the current market conditions  determines the ultimate sales price we can obtain for our products and the resulting gross margin 
the mix of products we sell in any period is ultimately determined by our customers needs 
therefore  the mix of products sold in any given period can change significantly from the prior period 
as a result  our consolidated gross margin can be significantly impacted in any given period by a change in the mix of products sold in that period 
we sell most of our products to semiconductor manufacturers and third party test and assembly houses end user sales and to ate manufacturers oem sales who ultimately resell our equipment with theirs to semiconductor manufacturers 
our thermal products segment also sells into a variety of other industries including the aerospace  automotive  communications  consumer electronics  defense  and medical industries 
the mix of customers during any given period will affect our gross margin due to differing sales discounts and commissions 
for the years ended december   and  our oem sales as a percentage of net revenues were  and  respectively 
oem sales generally have a lower gross margin than end user sales  as oem sales historically have had a more significant discount 
our current net operating margins on most oem sales  however  are only slightly less than margins on end user sales because of the payment of third party sales commissions on most end user sales 
we have also continued to experience demands from our oem customers supply line managers to reduce our sales prices to them 
if we cannot further reduce our manufacturing and operating costs  these pricing pressures will continue to reduce our gross and operating margins 
risk factors please see item a risk factors for a discussion of other important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our prior results or those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
results of operations all of our products are used by semiconductor manufacturers in conjunction with ate in the testing of ics 
consequently  the results of operations for each product segment are generally affected by the same factors 
separate discussions and analyses for each product segment would be repetitive and obscure any unique factors that affected the results of operations of our different product segments 
the discussion and analysis that follows  therefore  is presented on a consolidated basis for the company as a whole and includes discussion of factors unique to each product segment where significant to an understanding of each segment

as previously discussed  sales of our tester interface products experienced higher levels of demand during the first half of  primarily due to an increase in orders for new and existing product designs from one particular oem customer 
this increase in demand during the first half of was the primary reason that total net revenues for for this segment increased over the level experienced in gross margin 
gross margin was for as compared to for the decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of an increase in our fixed operating costs as a percentage of net revenues 
although the absolute dollar amount of these costs decreased million in as compared to  they were not as fully absorbed during due to the lower net revenue levels as compared to which resulted in these costs increasing to of net revenues in as compared to of net revenues in the million decrease in fixed operating costs was primarily driven by reductions in salaries and benefits expense  lower levels of depreciation  and a reduction in facilities costs 
salaries and benefits expense declined in as compared to as a result of headcount reductions and other compensation reductions related to our various restructuring plans implemented during the decrease in depreciation reflects a lower asset base as of december  compared to december  facilities costs were lower in as compared to primarily as a result of lower rent expense due to a reduction in the size of our facility in cherry hill  new jersey 
these decreases were partially offset by fixed labor and overhead costs at our machine shop in cherry hill which were not as fully absorbed due to lower volume at this operation during as compared to as well as the addition of  of fixed operating costs resulting from the operations of diamond which we acquired in july to a lesser extent  both direct labor and charges for excess and obsolete inventory increased as a percentage of net revenues in as compared to in absolute dollar terms  direct labor declined  during as compared to reflecting reduced headcount 
however  similar to our fixed operating costs  as a result of the reduced revenue levels  these costs were not as fully absorbed in as compared to charges for excess and obsolete inventory increased both in absolute dollar intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued terms and as a percentage of net revenues during as compared to the  increase in the absolute dollar amount of these charges was primarily related to inventory at our manufacturing facility in amerang  germany  which we closed during the increases in fixed operating costs  direct labor and excess and obsolete inventory charges as a percentage of net revenues were partially offset by a reduction in component material costs as a percentage of net revenues  reflecting changes in product and customer mix 
selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily driven by lower levels of commissions as a result of the lower sales levels 
to a lesser extent  there was also a reduction in travel reflecting both our cost containment efforts and the generally lower level of business activity in as compared to these decreases were partially offset by an increase in warranty charges 
total warranty charges were  in compared to warranty recoveries of  in  which reflected favorable claims experience 
engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
the decrease is primarily a result of lower salary and benefits expense  reflecting lower headcount and other compensation adjustments related to our restructuring plans 
to a lesser extent there was also a reduction in the use of third party consultants 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in spending on research and development materials and legal fees related to our intellectual property 
the increase in spending on research and development materials was primarily at our facility in amerang  germany where development of a new family of manipulators had been ongoing 
these development efforts were transferred to our facility in cherry hill  new jersey when the facility in germany was closed in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
lower salary and benefits expense reflecting lower headcount and other reductions in compensation  as previously discussed  was partially offset by an increase in fees related to third party professionals retained in connection with the closure of our facility in amerang  germany as well as the acquisition of sigma 
impairment of long lived assets 
during  due to the significant operating losses experienced by our mechanical products and electrical products segments  combined with our forecasts that indicated potential future losses for these segments  we recorded a charge of million for the partial impairment of certain long lived assets 
the impaired assets which are allocated to our electrical products segment include property and equipment 
the impaired assets which are allocated to our mechanical products segment include intangible assets which consist of the patent applications held by our intestlogic subsidiary at the time of our acquisition of this operation in  a customer list and a non compete agreement which resulted from our acquisition of diamond in july  as well as certain property and equipment held by our cherry hill manufacturing facility and our japanese sales and distribution operation 
during  due to the significant operating losses experienced by our mechanical produc ts segment  combined with our forecasts that indicated potential future losses for this product segment  we recorded a charge of  for the partial impairment of certain long lived assets 
these long lived assets consisted of property and equipment at our cherry hill manufacturing facility 
please refer to note of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these charges 
impairment of goodwill 
during and  due to the significant operating losses experienced by our mechanical products segment  combined with our forecasts that indicated potential future losses for this segment  we recorded charges of  and million  respectively 
in  the charge represented the full impairment of the goodwill that resulted from the acquisition of diamond in july in  the charge represented the full impairment of goodwill related to the prior acquisition of the minority interests in our foreign subsidiaries 
please refer to note of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these charges 
restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges were  for there were no restructuring and other charges in as previously discussed  during the second half of  we implemented several restructuring plans which included workforce reductions and facility closures 
the costs incurred were for one time termination benefits and lease termination costs related to these actions 
in connection with the current review of our operations  we will likely incur restructuring charges in the future  however  we cannot predict the amount at this time 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other income 
other income was  for compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in other income was primarily due to a decrease in interest income reflecting lower average cash balances 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in other income related to the growth in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies purchased to fund employee benefits at our japanese subsidiary 
income tax expense 
for  we recorded income tax expense of  compared to  for our effective tax rate was for compared to for we record income tax expense or benefit based on the expected annualized effective tax rate for the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate our businesses 
due to our history of operating losses in both our domestic and certain of our foreign operations  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of these operations  including net operating loss carryforwards  where we believe it is more likely than not that we will not have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets before they expire 
during  the income tax expense recorded primarily represents income tax expense on the taxable income of one of our foreign operations where we do not have a history of operating losses and therefore do not have net operating loss carryforwards to offset income tax expense on those earnings 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
during  the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our mechanical products and electrical products segments decreased and  respectively  as compared to  while the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our thermal products segment remained relatively unchanged 
the decrease in our net revenues reflects lower levels of demand experienced in as compared to by our mechanical products and electrical products segments resulting from the factors previously discussed in the overview 
as previously discussed  sales of our thermal products have not been as significantly affected as our other products by the changes in demand in the semiconductor industry  in part due to our ability to diversify sales 
gross margin 
gross margin was for as compared to for the decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of an increase in our fixed operating costs as a percentage of net revenues 
although the absolute dollar amount of these costs decreased  in as compared to  they were not as fully absorbed during due to the lower net revenue levels as compared to which resulted in these costs increasing to of net revenues in as compared to of net revenues in the  decrease in fixed operating costs was primarily driven by reductions in insurance premiums  lower levels of depreciation  lower salaries and benefits expense and a reduction in facilities costs 
the reduction in insurance premiums primarily reflects the reduction in the volume of business activity in as compared to the decrease in depreciation reflects a lower asset base as of december  compared to december  salaries and benefits expense declined in as compared to as a result of headcount reductions during  primarily in our electrical products segment 
facilities costs were lower in as compared to primarily as a result of lower utilities and related facilities costs for our thermal products operation in sharon  massachusetts combined with lower rent expense due to a reduction in the size of our facility in cherry hill  new jersey  commencing in october these decreases were partially offset by fixed labor and overhead costs at our machine shops in cherry hill and silicon valley which were not as fully absorbed due to lower volume at these operations during as compared to to a lesser extent  both direct labor and charges for excess and obsolete inventory increased as a percentage of net revenues in as compared to in absolute dollar terms  direct labor declined  during as compared to reflecting reduced headcount 
however  similar to our fixed operating costs  as a result of the reduced revenue levels  these costs were not as fully absorbed in as compared to charges for excess and obsolete inventory increased both in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of net revenues during as compared to the  increase in the absolute dollar amount of these charges reflects that  as demand remains at reduced levels  more of our inventory is meeting the criteria we use to evaluate whether items in our inventory are excess or obsolete 
the increases in fixed operating costs  direct labor and excess and obsolete inventory charges as a percentage of net revenues were partially offset by a reduction in component material costs as a percentage of net revenues  reflecting changes in product and customer mix 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily driven by lower levels of warranty charges  reflecting favorable claims experience 
to a lesser extent  there was also a reduction in fees paid to third parties for installation of our products at customer sites  primarily in asia  and lower levels of commissions as a result of the lower sales levels 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in salary and benefits expense reflecting increased headcount  primarily at our thermal products and mechanical products segments 
engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
during  we received  in reimbursement payments for engineering services under a contract with one of the customers of our electrical products segment 
this reimbursement offset  of salary and benefits expense and expenditures for research and development materials incurred during  as well as reimbursing  of development costs incurred in periods prior to the negotiation of this reimbursement contract 
the reduction in engineering and product development costs in as compared to after excluding the reimbursement of prior period costs from is primarily the result of lower salary and benefits expense  reflecting fewer staff  and a reduction in spending on research and development materials  reflecting fewer new product development projects in the prototype phase which require increased spending on research and development materials 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily driven by an increase in salary and benefits expense which reflects both a  severance payment in to the former managing director of our intestlogic operation as well as the restoration of salaries and benefits in the second and third quarters of that had been reduced in late and early as part of our cost containment initiatives during those years 
this increase was partially offset by decreases in performance based compensation as a result of our overall and segment performance for impairment of long lived assets 
during  due to the significant operating losses experienced by our mechanical products segment  combined with our forecasts that indicated potential future losses for this product segment  we recorded a charge of  for the partial impairment of certain long lived assets 
these long lived assets consisted of property and equipment at our cherry hill manufacturing facility 
please refer to note of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this charge 
there was no similar charge in impairment of goodwill 
during  due to the significant operating losses experienced by our mechanical products segment  combined with our forecasts that indicated potential future losses for this product segment  we recorded a charge of million for the full impairment of goodwill related to prior acquisitions made in this product segment

other income was  for compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in other income was primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange losses 
during  we recorded a  foreign currency translation adjustment related to the final dissolution of our uk operation which was completed during the fourth quarter of this  gain offset the foreign exchange losses we incurred in in the normal operation of our business 
there was no similar transaction in the increase in foreign exchange losses in as compared to was partially offset by an increase in interest income in as compared to the increase in interest income reflects higher average cash balances as well as an increase in the rate of interest being earned during by some of our operations 
income tax expense 
for  we recorded income tax expense of  compared to million for our effective tax rate was for compared to for due to our history of operating losses in both our domestic and certain of our foreign operations  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of these operations  including net operating loss carryforwards  where we believe it is more likely than not that we will not have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets before they expire 
during  the income tax expense recorded primarily represents income intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued tax expense on the taxable income of our foreign operations where we do not have a history of operating losses and therefore do not have net operating loss carryforwards to offset income tax expense on those earnings 
the reduction in our effective tax rate for compared to reflects that the losses of our domestic operations and certain of our foreign operations represented a larger proportion of our total results for than in liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operations was million for compared to  for the increase in cash used in operations in was primarily the result of our million net loss in as compared to a net loss of million in the net loss in included non cash charges of million related to the impairment of long lived assets and  related to the impairment of goodwill compared to non cash charges in of million related to the impairment of goodwill and  related to the impairment of long lived assets 
during  accounts receivable decreased million  inventories decreased million and accounts payable decreased  primarily reflecting the lower level of business activity experienced in as compared to prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased  primarily as a result of our japanese operation receiving a refund of an estimated tax payment made in combined with changes in the amount of prepaid consumption and value added taxes at certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
accrued wages and benefits decreased  primarily as a result of the reduction in headcount combined with the timing of payments to employees 
net cash paid to acquire sigma and diamond totaled million during please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on these acquisitions 
purchases of property and equipment were  for these purchases primarily consisted of demonstration equipment for our facilities in sharon  massachusetts and san jose  california 
we have no significant commitments for capital expenditures for  however  depending upon changes in market demand  we may make such purchases as we deem necessary and appropriate

in light of deteriorating conditions in the semiconductor industry and the global economic recession  we initiated a series of restructuring and cost reduction programs during the fourth quarter of which have continued into the first and second quarters of  as previously discussed  in order to conserve cash and reduce costs 
in april  we retained the services of a financial advisor to assist us in assessing our strategic alternatives to enhance operating performance and stockholder value 
under present market conditions and with our present resources  our goals remain to conserve cash  reduce costs and generate sales of our products 
we also continue to consider other alternatives  however  if we are not successful in accomplishing these goals or alternatives  we may be forced to seek relief through a filing under the us bankruptcy code or liquidate and dissolve our business 
see risk factors 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on many events  some of which may be outside of our direct control  including  among other things  the success and timeliness of our cost reduction initiatives and the availability of financing  if needed  to fund our intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued working capital requirements 
we have incurred significant losses in three of the last five years including losses in and these losses were attributable to operations as well as to charges for impairments and restructurings 
we have managed our liquidity during this time primarily through a series of cost reduction initiatives 
however  the continuing weakness and turmoil of the macroeconomic environment that began in  and has worsened in  has resulted in a significant reduction in equipment utilization rates in the semiconductor industry  which has had a significant negative impact on our bookings 
our bookings for the first quarter of decreased to million compared to million for the fourth quarter of and million for the third quarter of while we presently see some positive indicators in certain of our segments  we cannot be certain that the downturn is reversing or that we will have sufficient cash to continue to operate 
consequently  we continue to r emain focused on methods to restructure our business and reduce our cash burn or to identify appropriate strategic alternatives 
however  if we are not successful in accomplishing these goals or alternatives  we may be forced to seek relief through a filing under the us bankruptcy code or liquidate and dissolve our business

we do not currently have any available credit facilities under which we can borrow to help fund our working capital requirements 
new or recently adopted accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new or recently adopted accounting standards 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  long lived assets  goodwill  identifiable intangibles  deferred income tax valuation allowances and product warranty reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of these accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ ma rkedly from what had been assumed when the financial statements were prepared 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at standard cost  which approximates actual cost computed on a first in  first out basis  not in excess of market value 
on a quarterly basis  we review our inventories and record excess and obsolete inventory charges based upon our established objective excess and obsolete inventory criteria 
these criteria identify material that has not been used in a work order during the prior twelve months and the quantity of material on hand that is greater than the average annual usage of that material over the prior three years 
in certain cases  additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based upon current industry conditions  anticipated product life cycles  new product introductions and expected future use of the inventory 
the charges for excess and obsolete inventory that we record establish a new cost basis for the related inventory 
in  we recorded an inventory obsolescence charge for excess and obsolete inventory of million 
long lived asset valuation we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could indicate impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we prepare projections of operations for our product segments where these intangibles and or long lived assets are associated 
if the carrying value of the intangible assets and or long lived assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of our projections  then we would measure the impairment charge 
we measure the impairment based on the e xcess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
at december   identifiable intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued intangibles and long lived assets were million 
during  we recorded a million charge for the impairment of certain long lived assets of our mechanical products and our electrical products segments 
please refer to note of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this charge 
goodwill at least annually  we review our goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
if the result of this analysis is that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets  resulting in an implied valuation of goodwill associated with the reporting unit 
we would measure the impairment based on the difference between the implied valuation of the goodwill and its actual carrying value 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of  for the full impairment of goodwill related to the diamond acquisition made in our mechanical products reporting unit 
please refer to note of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this charge 
as of december   goodwill was million 
income taxes deferred tax assets are analyzed to determine if there will be sufficient taxable income in the future in order to realize such assets 
we assess all of the positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of the deferred tax assets  including our historical results of operations for the recent past and our projections of future results of operations  in which we make subjective determinations of future events 
if  after assessing all of the evidence  both positive and negative  a determination is made that the realizability of the deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a deferred tax valuation allowance for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets depending upon the specific facts 
if any of the significant assumptions were changed  materially different results could occur  which could significantly change the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance established 
as of december   due to our history of operating losses  we have a valuation allowance aga inst all deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  where we believe it is more likely than not that we will not have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets before they expire 
product warranty accrual in connection with the accrual of warranty costs associated with our products  we make assumptions about the level of product failures that may occur in the future 
these assumptions are primarily based upon historical claims experience 
should the rate of future product failures significantly differ from historical levels  our accrued warranty reserves would need to be adjusted  and the amount of the adjustment could be material 
at december   accrued warranty was  and we recorded charges related to product warranty of  for the year then ended
