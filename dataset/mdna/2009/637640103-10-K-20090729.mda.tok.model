overview we are one of the world s leading semiconductor companies focused on analog and mixed signal integrated circuits and sub systems  particularly in the area of power management 
founded in  we design  develop  manufacture and market high value  high performance  analog intensive solutions that improve performance and energy efficiency in electronic systems 
we have a diversified product portfolio which includes power management circuits  audio and operational amplifiers  communication interface products and data conversion solutions 
our portfolio of over  products is sold to a diversified group of end customers from large original equipment manufacturers oems to smaller customers serviced by our extensive distribution network 
energy efficiency is our overarching theme and our powerwise products enable systems that consume less power  extend battery life and generate less heat 
we target a broad range of markets and applications such as wireless handsets including smart phones and other portable applications automotive applications factory and office automation wireless basestations medical applications network infrastructure photovoltaic systems industrial and sensing applications during fiscal  we announced our entry into the photovoltaic market with new technology designed to increase the overall energy output of solar electric power generating systems 
our initial product in this area  the solarmagic power optimizer  uses our power management and analog technology to provide a system level solution 
we benefit from an extensive intellectual property portfolio that includes more than  patents 
we are focused on supporting the innovation needed for a strong new product development pipeline 
for fiscal  our net sales were billion  our operating income was million and our net income was million 
a large portion of our sales come from analog products that are classified within the standard linear categories as defined by the world semiconductor trade statistics or wsts 
standard linear products are defined by wsts as amplifiers  data converters  regulators and references power management  and interface products  representing the fundamental circuits that electronic systems need in order to deal with continuously varying signals of the real world  such as light  sound  pressure  temperature and speed 
within the standard linear analog market  our greatest strengths have historically been in the power management  amplifier and interface areas where higher performance coupled with ease of use typically result in higher gross margins 
in addition to standard linear products  we also develop application specific analog sub systems that typically carry higher values and are often targeted at high growth markets 
approximately percent of our revenue in fiscal was generated from analog segment products 
during fiscal  we reorganized our product line operations by consolidating the former two group structure power management and the signal path groups into one group called the product group 
the product group is responsible for designing and page of developing a wide range of analog integrated circuits  many of which convert and regulate voltages to ensure that electronic systems operate to their fullest potential with the lowest overall power consumption or the highest energy efficiency 
it also designs and develops integrated circuits that handle the requisite analog technology for information or data as it travels from the point where it enters the electronic system  is conditioned  converted and processed to the point where it is sent out 
in addition to providing real world interfaces  these products are used extensively in signal conditioning  signal conversion from analog to digital and vice versa and high speed interfacing applications

recent highlights throughout fiscal  we continued to focus on analog product areas  particularly higher performance  higher value areas where we are able to leverage the increasing need for energy efficiency 
as a part of our business focus  we periodically identify opportunities to improve our cost structure or to divest or reduce involvement in product areas that are not in line with our business objectives  as well as pursue acquisitions or business investments to gain access to key technologies that we believe augment our existing technical capability and support our business objectives 
for example  we announced in march that we would take actions to reduce overall expenses in response to weak economic conditions and related business levels 
as a result  we eliminated approximately positions worldwide 
in addition  we plan to further reduce headcount by approximately over the next months through the eventual closure of our manufacturing facilities in arlington  texas and suzhou  china 
prior to these actions  we announced a global workforce reduction in november that eliminated approximately positions and the closure of two design centers located in the united states 
for a more complete discussion of these actions  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in march  we also acquired actsolar  inc actsolar  a privately held solar energy company that provides power optimization solutions for commercial and utility scale solar installations 
the acquisition of actsolar is intended to expand our portfolio of power optimization technologies along with the acquisition of new diagnostics and panel monitoring capabilities for solar arrays 
for a more complete discussion of this acquisition  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in february  we amended the credit agreement associated with our unsecured term loan with a consortium of banks 
the amendment increased the interest rate of the loan and modified certain financial covenants 
in addition  we agreed to make a principal prepayment of million in march  which reduced the amount of each of the last four installments due under the loan to million from million 
we repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for million during fiscal these shares were purchased in the open market in connection with the million stock repurchase program announced in june we also continued our dividend program in fiscal  during which time we paid a total of million in cash dividends 
subsequent to the fiscal year end  on june   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock  which was paid on july  to shareholders of record at the close of business on june  products semiconductors are integrated circuits in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated circuit or discrete devices such as individual transistors 
in an integrated circuit  various components are page of fabricated in a small area or chip of silicon  which is then encapsulated in plastic  ceramic or other advanced forms of packaging and can then be connected to a circuit board or substrate 
we manufacture an extensive range of analog intensive and mixed signal integrated circuits  which are used in numerous applications 
while no precise industry definition exists for analog and mixed signal devices  we consider products which process analog information or convert analog to digital or digital to analog as analog and mixed signal devices 
we are a leading supplier of analog and mixed signal products  serving both broad based markets such as the consumer  industrial  medical  automotive and communications  and more narrowly defined markets such as wireless handsets including smart phones and other portable applications  led lighting  renewable energy  portable medical and communications infrastructure

our diverse portfolio of intellectual property enables us to develop building block products  application specific standard products and custom large scale integrations for our customers 
our high performance building blocks and application specific standard products allow our customers to solve challenging technical problems and to differentiate their systems in a way that is beneficial to the end user 
with our leadership in ease of use tools  innovative packaging and analog process technology  we can address growth opportunities that depend upon the critical elements of efficiency  physical size and performance 
we directly service top tier oems in a number of markets and we reach a broader range of customers through our franchised distributors 
corporate organization during fiscal  we reorganized our product line operations by consolidating the former two group structure power management and the signal path groups into one group called the product group 
within this group are all of our various product line business units 
many of our products are part of our powerwise portfolio of products  which are parts that are deemed to be highly energy efficient relative to the function they are performing 
product group the product group has four different business units that address the power management area advanced power  infrastructure power products  mobile devices power and performance power products 
there are also two business units that address the signal path area precision signal path and high speed product 
there is also a custom solutions business unit within the product group 
power management refers to the conversion and management of power consumption in electronic systems 
integrated circuits such as digital processors  analog to digital converters and light emitting diodes each require different power sources to operate efficiently 
power management integrated circuits convert and regulate voltages to ensure that electronic systems operate properly 
our high performance power management portfolio provides valuable solutions to our customers to solve design problems in space and energy constrained applications from feature rich portable devices to large line powered systems 
the four business units that address power management design  develop and manufacture a wide range of products including high efficiency switching voltage regulators and controllers high performance low drop out voltage regulators accurate led drivers precision voltage references page of battery management integrated circuits photovoltaic power optimizer solutions we are targeting growth in our power management business by balancing our focus between broad customer needs and specific target markets 
we continue to strengthen our broad portfolio of power management integrated circuits which can address customer needs in a variety of end markets such as consumer  industrial  medical  automotive and communications infrastructure 
at the same time  we focus on markets  such as personal mobile devices or high power leds  which can provide more rapid growth opportunities from customers that value the performance our products deliver  such as energy efficiency and size or heat reduction 
we continue to enhance the performance of power management building blocks in terms of providing greater efficiency  increased power density  tighter accuracy and wider voltage ranges 
these building block products can also be leveraged into the development of highly integrated application specific standard products for high volume applications 
signal path refers to the analog technology that is applied to the path that information or data travels along from the point where it enters the electronic equipment and is conditioned  converted and processed to the point where it is sent out 
our signal path products provide a vital technology link that allows the user to connect to digital information and are used to enable and enrich the user experience of sight and sound from many electronic applications 
in addition to providing the real world interfaces  signal path products are used extensively in signal conditioning  signal conversion from analog to digital and vice versa and high speed signal interfacing applications 
the two business units that focus on signal path  design  develop and manufacture a wide range of products including high speed and precision operational amplifiers high fidelity  low power audio amplifiers high speed and power efficient analog to digital converters and digital to analog converters precision timing products high speed communication interface and signal conditioning products thermal management products we continually develop more high performance analog products that can address applications in the portable  consumer  industrial  medical  automotive and communications infrastructure markets 
with our growing product portfolio of high performance building blocks  we continue to improve performance by providing greater precision  higher speed and lower power which our customers value 
these building block products can also be leveraged into the development of highly integrated application specific standard products for high volume applications 
the high speed product business unit also includes hi rel products that supply integrated circuits to the high reliability market  which includes avionics  defense and aerospace customers 
the custom solutions business unit supplies user designed application specific products in the form of standard cells  gate arrays and full custom devices 
this business unit also supplies key telecommunications components for analog and digital line cards  as well as bit and bit microcontrollers 
worldwide marketing and sales group  key market segments group  technology development group and manufacturing operations group separate from our business operating groups  our corporate structure in fiscal includes the worldwide marketing and sales group  key market segments group  the technology development group and the manufacturing operations group 
the worldwide marketing and sales group is our global sales and marketing organization organized around the four major regions of the world where we operate 
we define our four major regions as the americas  asia pacific  europe and japan which is not a part of the asia pacific region 
reference to these regions elsewhere in this document is based on this definition 
page of as part of our overall marketing and business development effort  we have a separate dedicated group that concentrates solely on key market segments that the company has identified and targeted for future growth 
the key market segments organization includes industry experts  technologists and business development staff who work closely with our product lines to accelerate the penetration of our analog solutions in these specific markets with high growth potential 
the technology development group is a centralized worldwide organization primarily responsible for process development  technology infrastructure and shared engineering services 
process development consists of research in and development of proprietary processes for the manufacture of our products 
technology infrastructure provides a range of process libraries  product cores and software  and the selection and support of computer aided design tools used in the design  layout and simulation of our products 
engineering services provide test development and failure analysis services used broadly across our product lines 
the manufacturing operations group is a centralized worldwide organization that manages all production  including outsourced manufacturing  global logistics and packaging technology  and is responsible for quality assurance  purchasing and supply chain management 
segment financial information and geographic information for segment reporting purposes  each of our product line business units represents an operating segment as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
business units that have similarities  including economic characteristics  underlying technology  markets and customers  are aggregated into larger segments 
under the criteria in sfas no 
 analog is our only reportable segment for fiscal the remaining business units that are not included in the analog reportable segment are grouped as all others 
our business is dependent on the success of our analog segment since it represents approximately percent of our sales in fiscal consequently  the analog segment faces the same risks as those for the company as a whole including risks attendant to our foreign operations 
for a more complete discussion of those risks  see the discussion that appears in part i  item a 
risk factors  of this form k 
for further financial information on the analog reportable segment  as well as geographic information  refer to the information contained in note  segment and geographic information  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item marketing and sales we market our products globally to oems and original design manufacturers odms through a direct sales force 
some of our major oems include apple motorola samsung finisar nokia sharp general dynamics nokia siemens network siemens lg electronics research in motion ltd sony ericsson mobile communications lm ericsson robert bosch triquint it is becoming increasingly common in the technology industry for oems to use contract manufacturers to build their products and odms to design and build products 
as a result  our design wins with major oems  particularly in the computing and cellular phone markets  can ultimately result in sales to a third party contract manufacturer or odm 
in addition to our direct sales force  we use distributors in our four geographic business regions  and approximately percent of our fiscal net sales were made to distributors 
in line with industry practices  we generally credit distributors for the effect of price reductions on their inventory of our products and  under specific conditions  we repurchase products that we have discontinued 
distributors do not have the right to return product except under customary warranty provisions 
the programs we offer to our distributors include the following allowances involving pricing and volume 
we refer to this as the contract sales debit program 
allowances for inventory scrap 
we refer to this as the scrap allowance program 
under the contract sales debit program  products are sold to distributors at standard prices published in price books that are broadly provided to our various distributors 
distributors are required to pay for this product within our page of standard commercial terms 
after the initial purchase of the product  the distributor has the opportunity to request a price allowance for a particular part number depending on the current market conditions for that specific part as well as volume considerations 
this request is made prior to the distributor reselling the part 
once we have approved an allowance to the distributor  the distributor proceeds with the resale of the product and credits are issued to the distributor in accordance with the specific allowance that we approved 
periodically  we issue new distributor price books 
for those parts for which the standard prices have been reduced  we provide an immediate credit to distributors for inventory quantities they have on hand 
under the scrap allowance program  certain distributors are given a contractually defined allowance to cover the cost of any scrap they might incur 
the amount of the allowance is specifically agreed upon with each distributor 
our regional facilities in the united states  europe  japan and asia pacific handle local customer support 
these customer support centers respond to inquiries on product pricing and availability  pre sale customer technical support requests  order entry and scheduling  and post sale support under our product warranty provisions 
the technical support provided to our customers consists of marketing activities that occur prior to sale of product to our customers and for which we have no contractual obligation and no fees are charged 
technical support consists primarily of aiding customers in product selection and answering questions about our products 
we augment our sales effort with application engineers based in the field 
these engineers are specialists in various aspects of our product portfolio and work with customers to identify and design our integrated circuits into customers products and applications 
these engineers also help identify emerging markets for new products and are supported by our design centers in the field or at manufacturing sites 
we also provide web based  on line tools that allow customers and potential customers to select our devices  create a design using our parts  and simulate performance of that design 
customers our top ten customers combined represented approximately percent of total accounts receivable at may  and approximately percent at may  net sales to major customers as a percentage of total net sales were as follows distributor avnet arrow oem nokia less than although we do not have any other customers with sales greater than percent  we do have several other large oem customers that manufacture and market wireless handsets and other electronic products 
these customers typically purchase a range of different products from us 
if any one of these customers were to cease purchasing products from us within a very short timeframe  such as within one quarter  it could have a negative impact on our financial results for that period 
backlog in accordance with industry practice  we frequently revise semiconductor backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders to reflect changes in customer needs 
we rarely formally enforce binding agreements for the sale of specific quantities at specific prices that are contractually subject to price or quantity revisions  consistent with industry practice 
for these reasons  we believe it would not be meaningful to disclose the amount of backlog at any particular date 
seasonality page of we are affected by the seasonal trends in the semiconductor and related industries 
we typically experience sequentially lower sales in our first and third fiscal quarters  primarily due to customer vacation and holiday schedules 
sales usually reach a seasonal peak in our fourth fiscal quarter 
due to the significant deterioration in the global business environment  this typical seasonal trend did not occur during fiscal instead  we saw sales in each quarter beginning with the second quarter of fiscal decline sequentially compared to the prior quarter 
manufacturing the design of semiconductor and integrated circuit products is shaped by general market needs and customer requirements 
following product design and development  we generally produce integrated circuits in the following steps wafer fabrication 
product designs are compiled and digitized by state of the art design equipment and then transferred to silicon wafers in a series of complex precision processes that include oxidation  lithography  chemical etching  diffusion  deposition  implantation and metallization 
wafer sort 
the silicon wafers are tested and separated into individual circuit devices 
product assembly 
tiny wires are used to connect the electronic circuits on the device to the stronger metal leads of the package in which the device is encapsulated for protection 
final test 
the devices are subjected to a series of rigorous tests using computerized circuit testers and  for certain applications  environmental testers such as burn in ovens  centrifuges  temperature cycle or moisture resistance testers  salt atmosphere testers and thermal shock testers 
coating 
certain devices in the analog portfolio are designed to be used without traditional packaging 
in this case  the integrated circuit is coated with a protective material to allow mounting directly onto a circuit board 
our product line business units are supported by our global manufacturing infrastructure 
we have developed a number of proprietary manufacturing processes and packaging technologies to support our broad portfolio of analog products 
substantially all of our products are manufactured in our three wafer fabrication facilities in maine  texas and scotland 
assembly and test are performed primarily at our facilities in malaysia and china 
in march  we announced the eventual closure of our wafer fabrication facility in texas and our assembly and test plant in china 
the closure of these manufacturing facilities will occur over the next months and their production volume will be consolidated into our remaining manufacturing facilities in maine  scotland and malaysia 
at times and as needed  we outsource certain manufacturing functions to address capacity and other economic issues 
our wafer manufacturing processes include bipolar  metal oxide silicon  complementary metal oxide silicon and bipolar complementary metal oxide silicon technologies  including silicon germanium 
our efforts are heavily focused on proprietary processes that support our analog portfolio of products  which address wireless handsets  other personal mobile devices and a broad variety of other electronic applications 
the feature size of the individual transistors on a chip is measured in microns  one micron equals one millionth of a meter 
as products decrease in size and increase in functionality  our wafer fabrication facilities must be able to manufacture integrated circuits with sub micron circuit pattern widths 
this precision fabrication carries over to assembly and test operations  where advanced packaging technology and comprehensive testing are required to address the ever increasing performance and complexity embedded in integrated circuits 
raw materials our manufacturing processes use certain key raw materials critical to our products 
these include silicon wafers  certain chemicals and gases  ceramic and plastic packaging materials and various precious metals 
we also rely on subcontractors to supply finished or semi finished products which we then market through our sales channels 
we obtain raw materials and semi finished or finished products from various sources  although the number of sources for any particular material or product is relatively limited 
we believe our current supply of essential materials is sufficient to meet our needs 
however  shortages have occurred from time to time and could occur again 
significant increases in demand  rapid product mix changes or natural disasters could affect our ability to procure materials or goods 
research and development our research and development efforts consist of research in metallurgical  electro mechanical and solid state sciences  manufacturing process development and product design 
research and development of most process technologies are conducted by our technology development group 
specific product design and development is generally done in our business units 
total research and development expenses were million for fiscal  or percent of net sales  page of compared to million for fiscal  or percent of net sales  and million for fiscal  or percent of net sales 
the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects cost savings associated with the cost reduction actions announced in november and in fiscal combined with lower annual payroll and employee benefits expenses 
fiscal expenses also reflect savings from reduced discretionary spending in response to the weakening economic environment during the same time frame 
share based compensation expense included in r d expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal we are continuing to concentrate our research and development spending on analog products and underlying analog capabilities with particular emphasis on circuits that enable greater energy efficiency 
we continue to invest in the development of new analog products that can serve applications in a wide variety of end markets such as portable electronics  renewable energy products  communications infrastructure  industrial  medical  and automotive applications 
because of our focus on markets that require or involve greater energy efficiency  a significant portion of our research and development is directed at power management technology 
patents we own numerous united states and non us patents and have many patent applications pending 
we consider the development of patents and the maintenance of an active patent program advantageous to the conduct of our business 
however  we believe that continued success will depend more on engineering  production  marketing  financial and managerial skills than on our patent program 
we license certain of our patents to other manufacturers and participate in a number of cross licensing arrangements and agreements with other parties 
each license agreement has unique terms and conditions  with variations as to length of term  royalties payable  permitted uses and scope 
the majority of these agreements are cross licenses in which we grant a broad license to our intellectual property in exchange for receiving a similar corresponding license from the other party  and none are exclusive 
the amount of income we have received from licensing agreements has varied in the past  and we cannot precisely forecast the amount and timing of future income from licensing agreements 
on an overall basis  we believe that no single license agreement is material to us  either in terms of royalty payments due or payable or intellectual property rights granted or received 
employees at may   we employed approximately  people of whom approximately  were employed in the united states  in europe   in southeast asia  in china and in other areas 
we believe that our future success depends fundamentally on our ability to recruit and retain skilled technical and professional personnel 
our employees in the united states are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations worldwide to be favorable 
competition competition in the semiconductor industry is intense 
with our focus on high value analog  our major competitors include analog devices  linear technology  maxim integrated products and texas instruments 
in some cases  we may also compete with our customers 
competition is based on design and quality of products  product performance  price and service  with the relative importance of these factors varying among products and markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 
environmental regulations to date  our compliance with foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted to regulate the environment has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings  competitive or financial position 
for more information  see item  legal proceedings and note  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item however  we could be subject to fines  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of our operations if we fail to comply with present or future statutes and regulations governing the use  storage  handling  discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
page of item a 
risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations  results or financial condition 
you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and our other filings with the sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings 
these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like national with broad international operations 
like other companies  we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers 
similarly  the price of our stock is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions  differences in our results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community  and other factors beyond our control 
risk factors relating to general business conditions significant deterioration in the global business environment has reduced demand for our products  and our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected 
we have seen significant reductions in new order rates as a result of the current global business environment 
as a result of the credit market crisis including uncertainties with respect to financial institutions and the global capital markets and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the united states and other parts of the world  customers have modified  delayed and cancelled plans to purchase our products 
it is possible that conditions could get worse 
additionally  if customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing financing  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us 
any inability of current and or potential customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
if economic conditions in the united states and other key markets deteriorate further or do not show improvement  our business and operating results will continue to be adversely affected 
a large portion of our revenues is dependent on the wireless handset market 
the wireless handset market including smart phones is a significant source of our overall sales 
global economic difficulties have resulted in a slowdown in the sales of handsets and have adversely affected our revenues and profitability 
prolonged or continuing reductions in handset sales will adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
we continue to develop new products to address new features and functionality in handsets  such as advanced color displays  advanced audio  lighting features and battery management that can adequately handle the demands of these advanced features 
due to high levels of competition  as well as complex technological requirements  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in this targeted market 
although the worldwide handset market is large  future trends and other variables are difficult to predict and  as noted  shipments have declined recently as a result of the global economic difficulties 
since the wireless handset market is a consumer driven market  changes in the economy that affect consumer demand can adversely affect our business and operating results 
conditions inherent in the semiconductor industry may cause periodic fluctuations in our operating results 
rapid technological change and frequent introduction of new technology leading to more complex and integrated products characterize the semiconductor industry 
the result is a cyclical environment with potentially short product life cycles  characterized by significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand 
substantial capital and r d investment are required to support products and manufacturing processes in the semiconductor industry  which amplify the effect of this cyclicality although less capital investment is needed for analog products than for many other semiconductor products 
as a result of this environment  we may experience rapid and significant fluctuations in our operating results 
market shifts in product mix toward or away from higher margin products  including analog products  may also have a significant impact on our operating results 
page of our business will be harmed if we are unable to compete successfully in our markets 
competition in the semiconductor industry is intense 
our major competitors include analog devices  linear technology  maxim integrated products and texas instruments 
in some cases  we may also compete with our customers 
competition is based on design and quality of products  product performance  price and service  with the relative importance of these factors varying among products  markets and customers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 
risk factors relating to international operations we operate in the global marketplace and face risks associated with worldwide operations 
during fiscal  approximately percent of our sales were derived from customers in international markets 
we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant majority of our total revenue in future years 
we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in scotland  malaysia and china 
we are subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations  including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world 
in addition  the management of global operations subjects us to risks associated with trade balance issues  currency controls  differences in local business and cultural factors  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations 
global disruptions and events which could adversely affect our financial performance and operating results 
terrorist activities worldwide and hostilities in and between nation states  including the continuing hostilities and violence in iraq and afghanistan and the threat of future hostilities involving the united states and other countries  may cause uncertainty and instability in the overall state of the global economy or in the industries in which we operate 
we have no assurance that the consequences from these events will not disrupt our operations in either the united states or other regions of the world 
continued increases in oil prices  as well as spreading subprime mortgage failures  could also affect our operations 
pandemic illnesses that spread globally and or substantial natural disasters  as well as geopolitical events  may also affect our future costs  operating capabilities and revenues 
we have significant manufacturing operations in china and malaysia  and  as a result  are subject to risks 
we have significant assembly and test facilities in suzhou  china and melaka  malaysia 
while we have announced the planned closure of our chinese facility  our operations in china and malaysia are subject to the economic and political situation in each location 
we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations  including those relating to taxation  import and export tariffs  environmental regulations  land use rights  property and other matters 
we believe that our operations in china and malaysia are in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
however  we cannot assure you that new  stricter regulations will not be imposed or interpretations of existing regulations will not be changed  each of which would require additional expenditures 
changes in the political environment or government policies could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement  increased taxation  restrictions on imports  import duties or currency revaluations 
a significant destabilization of relations between the unites states and either china or malaysia could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our operations in that country 
with respect to china  the chinese legal systems relating to foreign trade and intellectual property are relatively new and continue to evolve 
enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation of laws may be inconsistent 
moreover  there is a high degree of fragmentation among chinese regulatory authorities resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions 
we are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar and foreign currencies 
while we transact business primarily in us dollars  and most of our revenues are denominated in us dollars  a portion of our costs and revenues is denominated in other currencies  such as the euro  the japanese yen  pound sterling and certain other asian currencies 
as a result  changes in the exchange rates of these or any other applicable currencies to the us dollar will affect our net sales  costs of goods sold and operating margins 
we have a program to hedge our exposure to currency rate fluctuations  but our hedging program may not be fully effective in preventing foreign exchange losses 
page of we are subject to export restrictions and laws affecting trade and investments 
as a global company headquartered in the united states  we are subject to us laws and regulations that limit and restrict the export of some of our products and related product information 
compliance with these laws has limited our operations and sales in the past and could significantly limit them in the future 
we maintain an export compliance program but there are risks of noncompliance exposing us to legal liabilities 
we must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments 
there is a risk that these restrictions and laws could significantly restrict our operations in the future 
risk factors relating to sales and operations our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials  utilities  critical manufacturing equipment and third party manufacturing services 
our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available 
limited or delayed access to or increases in the cost of these items  or the inability to implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our results of operations 
we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits 
we depend on a limited number of third parties  most of whom are located outside of the united states  to perform these subcontracted functions 
we do not have long term contracts with all of these third parties 
reliance on these third parties involves risks  including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand 
although we did not experience any material difficulties with supplies or subcontractors in fiscal  we have had difficulties in the past and could experience them in the future  including as a result of weak global economic conditions 
a substantial portion of our sales are made to distributors and the termination of an agreement with one or more distributors could result in a negative impact on our business 
in fiscal  our distributors accounted for approximately percent of our sales  with two of our distributors together accounting for percent of total sales 
distributors typically sell products from several of our competitors along with our products 
a significant reduction of effort to sell our products  the termination of our relationship with one or more distributors or distributor cash flow problems or other financial difficulties may reduce our access to certain end customers and adversely impact our ability to sell our products 
the termination of the distributor relationship agreement with a specific distributor could also result in the return of our inventory held by the distributor 
our profit margins may vary over time 
our profit margins may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including decreases in our shipment volume  reductions in  or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix 
in addition  the competitive market environment in which we operate may adversely affect pricing for our products  although we try to emphasize higher margin products 
because we own most of our manufacturing capacity  a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed  including costs associated with depreciation expense 
in general  these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing facilities at a high level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities will result in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 
we make forecasts of customer demand that may be inaccurate 
our ability to match inventory and production mix with the product mix needed to fill current orders and orders to be delivered in any given quarter may affect our ability to meet that quarter s revenue forecast 
to be able to accommodate customer requests for shorter shipment lead times  we manufacture product based on customer forecasts 
these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions 
while we believe our relationships with our customers  combined with our understanding of the end markets we serve  provide us with the ability to make reliable forecasts  if we inaccurately forecast customer demand  it could result in inadequate  excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins 
page of we are subject to warranty claims  product recalls and product liability 
we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards 
in the event of a warranty claim  we may also incur costs if we compensate the affected customer 
we maintain product liability insurance  but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims 
we may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of one of our customers products containing one of our devices 
although costs or payments we have made in connection with warranty claims or product recalls in the past have not materially affected our results of operations and financial condition  they could in the future 
we may be harmed by natural disasters and other disruptions 
our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other disruptions 
our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in california 
in the event of a major earthquake  or other natural or manmade disaster  we could experience loss of life of our employees  destruction of facilities or other business interruptions 
the operations of our suppliers could also be subject to natural disasters and other disruptions  which could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials 
we use third party freight firms for nearly all of our shipments from vendors and from our wafer manufacturing facilities to assembly and test sites and for shipments to customers of our final product 
this includes ground  sea and air freight 
any significant disruption of our freight shipments globally or in certain parts of the world  particularly where our operations are concentrated  would materially affect our operations 
we maintain property and business interruption insurance  but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all costs associated with such disasters and disruptions 
risk factors relating to r d  intellectual property and litigation we may experience delays in introducing new products or market acceptance of new products may be below our expectations 
rapidly changing technologies and industry standards  along with frequent new product introductions  characterize the industries in which our primary customers operate 
as our customers evolve and introduce new products  our success depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these changes in a timely and cost effective manner by developing and introducing into the market new products that meet the needs of our customers 
we are also directing efforts to develop new and different types of products to serve emerging mega trends such as energy efficiency 
we believe that continued focused investment in research and development  especially the timely development  introduction and market acceptance of new products  is a key factor to successful growth and the ability to achieve strong financial performance 
successful development and introduction of these new products are critical to our ability to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be successful in timely developing and introducing successful new products demanded by the market  or in achieving anticipated revenues from new products  and a failure to bring new products to market or achieve market success with them may harm our operating results 
we also cannot assure you that products that may be developed in the future by our competitors will not render our products obsolete or non competitive 
our products are dependent on the use of intellectual property that we need to protect 
we rely on patents  trade secrets  trademarks  mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies  and have a program to file applications for and obtain patents  trademarks  mask works and copyrights in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable  limited or not applied for in some countries 
some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the patents owned by us or numerous other patents which third parties license to us will not be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or licensed to other companies  or any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all  or our products will not be held to infringe patents of others 
we also seek to protect our proprietary technologies  including technologies that may not be patented or patentable  in part by confidentiality agreements and  if applicable  inventors rights agreements with our collaborators  advisors  employees and consultants 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our collaborators will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research collaborations 
in addition  we may not be able to enforce these agreements globally 
some of our technologies page of have been licensed on a non exclusive basis from other companies  which may license such technologies to others  including our competitors 
if necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under patents or intellectual property rights claimed by others 
however  we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies 
we are subject to litigation risks 
all industries  including the semiconductor industry  are subject to legal claims 
we are involved in a variety of routine legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
further discussion of certain specific material legal proceedings in which we are involved is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  litigation is inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
an unfavorable resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
risk factors related to our debt increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our total liabilities at the end of fiscal were billion 
of total liabilities  billion was debt incurred in connection with the accelerated stock repurchase program announced in june in june  we announced that we would incur billion of indebtedness under a bridge credit facility to purchase shares of our common stock through an accelerated stock repurchase program 
we subsequently issued billion in senior unsecured notes and entered into a bank loan in the aggregate principal amount of billion to fully repay the indebtedness under the bridge credit facility  of which we have since repaid approximately million 
as a result  this increase in long term debt and any future increase in our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations  including  without limitation we have additional cash requirements in order to support the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness  increases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  as well as to competitive pressure  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate and other purposes may be limited particularly in light of current credit market conditions  and our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry may be limited 
our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance  which is subject to general economic conditions  industry cycles and financial  business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  under our unsecured term loan with a consortium of banks  we are required to comply with certain covenants  including the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or maintain compliance with the covenants of our unsecured term loan due to current economic conditions or otherwise  we may take certain actions which require us to  among other things seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  refinance  retire or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  sell selected assets  reduce or delay planned capital expenditures  or reduce or delay planned operating expenditures 
such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms  if at all  particularly if our credit rating is not strong 
page of difficulties in the credit markets may limit our ability to refinance our debt as it becomes due 
as a result of the recent difficulties in the credit markets and limited availability of credit  we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt as it becomes due 
due to recent market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies may adversely affect the liquidity and financial conditions of issuers 
increases in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition 
increases in prevailing interest rates has an immediate effect on the interest rates charged on our variable rate debt  including the senior floating rate notes and bank debt  which rise and fall upon changes in interest rates on a quarterly basis 
although interest rates remained stable during fiscal  any increased interest expense associated with increases in interest rates affects our cash flow and our ability to service our debt 
as a protection against rising interest rates  we may enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
however  the other parties to the agreements may fail to perform or the terms may be unfavorable to us depending on rate movements 
risk factors relating to personnel and merger and acquisition activity we may not be able to attract or retain employees with skills necessary to remain competitive in our industry 
our continued success depends in part on the recruitment and retention of skilled personnel  including technical  marketing  management and staff personnel 
experienced personnel in the semiconductor industry  particularly in our targeted analog areas  are in high demand and competition for their skills is intense 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully recruit and retain the key personnel we require 
we may pursue acquisitions  investments and divestitures that could harm our operating results and may disrupt our business 
we have made and will continue to consider making strategic business investments  alliances and acquisitions we consider necessary to gain access to key technologies that we believe will augment our existing technical capability and support our business model objectives 
acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties that may unfavorably impact our future financial performance 
we may not be able to integrate and develop the technologies we acquire as expected 
if the technology is not developed in a timely manner  we may be unsuccessful in penetrating target markets 
with any acquisition there are risks that future operating results may be unfavorably affected by acquisition related costs  including in process r d charges and incremental r d spending 
we have made and will continue to consider making strategic divestitures 
with any divestiture  there are risks that future operating results could be unfavorably impacted if targeted objectives  such as cost savings  are not achieved or if other business disruptions occur as a result of the divestiture or activities related to the divestiture 
risk factors relating to tax and environmental regulations we may be affected by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 
as a global company  our effective tax rate is dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions  and complex analyses and significant judgment are required to determine worldwide tax liabilities 
from time to time  we have received notices of tax assessments in various jurisdictions where we operate 
we may receive future notices of assessments and the amounts of these assessments or our failure to favorably resolve such assessments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have significant amounts of deferred tax assets 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax benefits will not be realized 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions  or if there is a significant change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  which would cause an increase in our effective tax rate 
proposals and discussions in congress and the executive branch for new us tax legislation could  if adopted  adversely affect our effective tax rate 
a significant increase in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
page of we are subject to many environmental laws and regulations 
increasingly stringent environmental regulations restrict the amount and types of materials that can be released from our operations into the environment 
while the cost of compliance with environmental laws has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations historically  compliance with these and any future regulations could require significant capital investments in pollution control equipment or changes in the way we make our products 
in addition  because we use hazardous and other regulated materials in our manufacturing processes  we are subject to risks of liabilities and claims  regardless of fault  resulting from accidental releases  including personal injury claims and civil and criminal fines 
the following should also be considered we currently are remediating past contamination at some of our sites  we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at a number of superfund sites where we or our predecessors disposed of wastes in the past  and significant regulatory and public attention on the impact of semiconductor operations on the environment may result in more stringent regulations  further increasing our costs

page of item properties we conduct manufacturing  as well as certain research and development activities  at our wafer fabrication facilities located in arlington  texas  south portland  maine  and greenock  scotland 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization based on wafer starts was percent for fiscal compared to percent for fiscal our assembly and test functions are performed primarily in our manufacturing facilities located in melaka  malaysia and in suzhou  china 
in march  we announced the eventual closure of our wafer fabrication facility in texas and our assembly and test plant in china 
although the closure of these manufacturing facilities will occur over the next months and their production volume will be consolidated into our remaining manufacturing facilities located in maine  scotland and malaysia  we expect our captive manufacturing capacity together with our third party subcontract manufacturing arrangements to be adequate to supply our needs in the foreseeable future 
our principal administrative and research facilities are located in santa clara  california

in general  we lease most of our design facilities and our sales and administrative offices 
as described in the business section under item of this form k  our manufacturing operations are centralized and shared among our product line business units  and no individual facility is dedicated to a specific operating segment 
page of item legal proceedings we currently are a party to various legal proceedings  including those noted below 
while we believe that the ultimate outcome of these various proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations  litigation is always subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include money damages or an injunction prohibiting us from selling one or more products 
were an unfavorable ruling to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the net income of the period in which the ruling occurs  and future periods 
tax matters we are not currently undergoing any federal tax audits 
our federal tax returns for fiscal through remain subject to possible examination by the irs 
several us state taxing jurisdictions are examining our state tax returns for fiscal through  and tax authorities from several foreign jurisdictions are also examining our foreign tax returns 
we believe we have made adequate tax payments and or accrued adequate amounts such that the outcome of these audits will have no material adverse effect on our financial statements 
environmental matters we have been named to the national priorities list superfund for our santa clara  california site and we have completed a remedial investigation feasibility study with the regional water quality control board rwqcb  which is acting as agent for the epa 
we have agreed in principle with the rwqcb on a site remediation plan  and we are conducting remediation and cleanup efforts at the site 
in addition to the santa clara site  we have been designated from time to time as a potentially responsible party by international  federal and state agencies for certain environmental sites with which we may have had direct or indirect involvement 
these designations are made regardless of the extent of our involvement 
these claims are in various stages of administrative or judicial proceedings and include demands for recovery of past governmental costs and for future investigations and remedial actions 
in many cases  the dollar amounts of the claims have not been specified and the claims have been asserted against a number of other entities for the same cost recovery or other relief as is sought from us 
we have also retained responsibility for environmental matters connected with businesses we sold in fiscal and  but we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings relating to those liabilities

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report on form k for the year ended may  strategy and business we design  develop  manufacture and market a wide range of semiconductor products  most of which are analog and mixed signal integrated circuits 
our goal is to be the premier provider of high performance  energy efficient analog and mixed signal solutions 
many of these solutions are marketed under our powerwise brand 
we are focused on the following marketing our extensive existing portfolio of general purpose analog products to a broad base of customers utilizing our established distribution channels and award winning design tools  identifying and understanding the complex application specific system problems addressable by analog innovation  providing energy efficient  analog intensive solutions that enable customers to differentiate their products while reducing the power consumption of their systems  targeting our analog solutions towards existing or emerging markets that can provide high growth and high returns  current examples would include wireless handsets including smart phones  led lighting  renewable energy  portable medical and communications infrastructure  strengthening and deepening our relationships with customers  and consistently delivering superior returns on invested capital to our shareholders 
approximately percent of our net sales in fiscal came from analog segment products 
beyond the standard linear categories defined by the world semiconductor trade statistics or wsts  we also sell analog subsystems specifically targeted at certain particular markets and applications 
energy efficiency is our overarching theme  and our powerwise products enable systems that consume less power  extend battery life and generate less heat 
our leading edge products include power management circuits and sub systems  audio and operational amplifiers  communication interface products and data conversion solutions 
one of our most recently launched products  the solarmagic power optimizer  was awarded the intersolar innovation award 
for more information on our business  see part i  item business  in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended may  critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies are those policies that have a significant effect on the determination of our financial position and results of operations 
these policies also require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments a revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of semiconductor products upon shipment  provided we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement typically in the form of a purchase order  title and risk of loss have passed to the page of customer  the amount is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured 
we record a provision for estimated future returns at the time of shipment 
approximately percent of our semiconductor product sales were made to distributors in fiscal  compared to approximately percent in fiscal and approximately percent in fiscal we have agreements with our distributors that cover various programs  including pricing adjustments based on resale pricing and volume  price protection for inventory and scrap allowances 
the revenue we record for these distribution sales is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net distribution revenue  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
our estimates are based upon historical experience rates by geography and product family  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current economic trends  and other related factors 
we continuously monitor the claimed allowance against the rates assumed in our estimates of the allowances 
actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our estimates 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results are dependent on our ability to make reliable estimates  and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
however  different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to our operating results 
service revenues are recognized as the services are provided or as milestones are achieved  depending on the terms of the arrangement 
these revenues are included in net sales and totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal certain intellectual property income is classified as revenue if it meets specified criteria established by company policy that defines whether it is considered a source of income from our primary operations 
these revenues are included in net sales and totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal all other intellectual property income that does not meet the specified criteria is not considered a source of income from primary operations and is therefore classified as a component of other operating income  net  in the consolidated statement of income 
intellectual property income is recognized when the license is delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is reasonably assured and remaining obligations are perfunctory or inconsequential to the other party 
b valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  or market 
the total carrying value of our inventory is reduced for any difference between cost and estimated market value of inventory that is determined to be obsolete or unmarketable  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
reductions in carrying value are deemed to establish a new cost basis 
inventory is not written up if estimates of market value subsequently improve 
we evaluate obsolescence by analyzing the inventory aging  order backlog and future customer demand on an individual product basis 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than what we have estimated  we may be required to write inventory down below the current carrying value 
while our estimates require us to make significant judgments and assumptions about future events  we believe our relationships with our customers  combined with our understanding of the end markets we serve  provide us with the ability to make reasonable estimates 
the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory has been materially consistent with previously estimated write downs we have recorded 
we also evaluate the carrying value of inventory for lower of cost or market on an individual product basis  and these evaluations are intended to identify any difference between net realizable value and standard cost 
net realizable value is used as a measure of market for purposes of evaluating lower of cost or market and is determined as the selling price of the product less the estimated cost of disposal 
when necessary  we reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value 
if actual market conditions and resulting product sales were to be less favorable than what we have projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
c impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
our long lived assets subject to this evaluation include property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets 
amortizable intangible assets subject to this evaluation include developed technology we have acquired  patents and technology licenses 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include page of significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition  significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset  significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions  and current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
our impairment evaluation of long lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if our estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 
we determine fair value based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
if  as a result of our analysis  we determine that our amortizable intangible assets or other long lived assets have been impaired  we will recognize an impairment loss in the period in which the impairment is determined 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we classify long lived assets as assets held for sale when the criteria have been met  as described under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
upon classification of an asset as held for sale  we cease depreciation of the asset and classify the asset as an other current asset at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
if an asset is held for sale as a result of a restructuring of operations  any write down to fair value less cost to sell is included as a restructuring expense in the consolidated statement of income 
when we commit to a plan to abandon a long lived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life  we revise depreciation estimates to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life 
we review depreciation estimates periodically  including both estimated useful lives and estimated salvage values 
these reviews may result in changes to historical depreciation rates  which are considered to be changes in accounting estimates and are accounted for on a prospective basis 
our impairment evaluation of goodwill is based on comparing the fair value to the carrying value of our reporting units containing goodwill 
our reporting units are based on our operating segments as defined under sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the fair value of a reporting unit is measured at the business unit level using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporates our estimates of future revenues and costs for those business units 
as of may  our reporting units containing goodwill include our advanced power  high speed product  infrastructure power products  mobile devices power  performance power products and precision signal path business units  all of which are operating segments within our analog reportable segment  and our custom solutions business unit which is included in the category all others 
the estimates we use in evaluating goodwill are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses 
if we fail to deliver new products for these business units  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if market conditions for these business units fail to materialize as anticipated  our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and we may incur charges for goodwill impairment  which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
d income taxes we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss and credit carryovers and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  using the enacted tax rate expected to be applied when the taxes are actually paid or recovered 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating loss and credit carryovers and differences between financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases become deductible 
in determining a valuation allowance  we consider past performance  expected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
we currently have a valuation allowance that has been established primarily against the reinvestment and investment tax credits related to our operation in malaysia  as we have concluded that the page of deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future due to a tax holiday granted by the malaysian government that will be effective for a ten year period beginning in our fiscal and the uncertainty of sufficient taxable income in malaysia beyond fiscal our forecast of expected future taxable income is based on historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods that the deferred tax assets are deductible 
changes in market conditions that differ materially from our current expectations and changes in future tax laws in the united states and international jurisdictions or changes in our tax structure may cause us to change our judgments of future taxable income 
these changes  if any  may require us to adjust the existing tax valuation allowance higher or lower than the amount we currently have recorded  such an adjustment could have a material impact on the tax expense for the fiscal year 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
although fasb interpretation no 
fin  which we adopted at the beginning of fiscal  provides further clarification on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements  the new threshold and measurement attribute prescribed by fin will continue to require significant judgment by management 
if the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what we have currently estimated  this could have a material impact on income tax expense 
e share based compensation we measure and record compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair values in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
we provide share based awards to our employees  executive officers and directors through various equity compensation plans including our employee equity  stock option  stock purchase and restricted stock plans 
the fair value of stock option and stock purchase equity awards is measured at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model and the fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of the cash award to be paid to each of our executive officers under retention arrangements approved by the compensation committee of our board of directors in november see note to the consolidated financial statements is measured each reporting period and is calculated using the monte carlo valuation method 
in determining fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and the monte carlo valuation method  management is required to make certain estimates of the key assumptions such as expected life  expected volatility  dividend yields and risk free interest rates 
the estimates of these key assumptions involve judgment regarding subjective future expectations of market price and trends 
the assumptions used in determining expected life and expected volatility have the most significant effect on calculating the fair value of share based awards 
for all options granted after december   we determine expected life based on historical stock option exercise experience for the last four years  adjusted for our expectation of future exercise activity 
for options granted prior to january   we use the simplified method specified by the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
to determine the expected life of stock options 
expected volatility is based on implied volatility  as management has determined that implied volatility better reflects the market s expectation of future volatility than historical volatility 
if we were to determine that another method to estimate these assumptions was more reasonable than our current methods  or if another method for calculating these assumptions were to be prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value for our share based awards could change significantly 
if the expected volatility and or expected life were increased under our assumptions  then the black scholes and monte carlo computations of fair value would also increase  thereby resulting in higher compensation costs being recorded 
sfas no 
r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the date of grant 
our estimate of forfeitures is based on our historical activity  which we believe is indicative of expected forfeitures 
in subsequent periods if the actual rate of forfeitures differs from our estimate  the forfeiture rates may be revised  as necessary 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on share based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
we also grant performance share units to executive officers that require us to estimate expected achievement of performance targets over a two year performance period 
this estimate involves judgment regarding future expectations of various financial performance measures such as those described in the overview section below 
if there are changes in our estimate of the level of financial performance measures expected to be page of achieved  the related share based compensation expense may be significantly increased or reduced in the period that our estimate changes 
overview we focus on providing leading edge analog solutions with a large portion of our sales classified within the analog standard linear categories as defined by wsts 
in fiscal  approximately percent of our total sales came from our analog segment 
we believe that the success we have achieved in these markets has been driven by our knowledge of the analog markets  our circuit design capabilities and our understanding of electronic systems  especially as they pertain to energy efficiency that is enabled by our products 
our success has also been due to our innovative packaging and proprietary analog process technology  as well as our comprehensive manufacturing supply and logistics network 
net sales were substantially lower in fiscal compared to sales in fiscal as we were negatively affected by the significant slowdown in the global economy 
as factory utilization declined to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal due to lower sales  our gross margin percentage was lower compared to fiscal our performance in gross margin percentage is dependent on our sales mix of higher value analog products  as well as manufacturing efficiencies and execution relative to the level of factory utilization 
we continue to direct our research and development investments on high value growth areas in analog markets and applications  with particular focus on power management and energy efficiency where our powerwise products enable systems that consume less power  extend battery life and generate less heat 
in reviewing our performance  we consider several key financial measures 
when reviewing our net sales performance  we look at sales growth rates  new order rates including turns orders  which are orders received with delivery requested in the same quarter  blended average selling prices  sales of new products and market share 
we gauge our operating income performance based on gross margin trends  product mix  blended average selling prices  factory utilization rates and operating expenses relative to sales 
although the current economic downturn has negatively affected our earnings per share in fiscal  we remain focused on growing our earnings per share over time while generating a consistently high return on invested capital by concentrating on operating income  working capital management  capital expenditures and cash management 
we determine return on invested capital based on net operating income after tax divided by invested capital  which generally consists of total assets reduced by goodwill and non interest bearing liabilities 
we repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for million during fiscal these shares were repurchased in the open market in connection with the million stock repurchase program announced in june the stock repurchase activity is one element of our overall program to deliver a consistently high return on invested capital  which we believe improves shareholder value over time 
we also continued with the dividend program in fiscal  during which time we paid a total of million in cash dividends 
on june   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock  which was paid on july  to shareholders of record at the close of business on june  the following table and discussion provide an overview of our operating results for fiscal  and years ended in millions may  change may  change may  net sales operating income as a of net sales net income as a of net sales net income for fiscal includes million for severance and restructuring expenses related to the actions taken to reduce overall expenses in response to weak economic conditions and related business levels 
those actions included workforce reductions in november and march and the planned closures of our manufacturing facilities in texas and china announced in march see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net income also includes a million in process r d charge related to the acquisition of actsolar  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements and million of other operating income see note to the consolidated financial statements 
page of these charges and credits are all pre tax amounts 
income tax expense for fiscal includes incremental tax expense of million related to the write down of foreign deferred tax assets that resulted from a tax holiday granted by the malaysian government that will be effective for a ten year period beginning in our fiscal the effect of the write down of foreign deferred tax assets was partially offset by million of tax benefits associated with r d tax credits  net of the portion of the tax benefit that did not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
net income for fiscal included million for severance and restructuring expenses related to a factory modernization effort announced in january and a workforce reduction announced in april see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net income for fiscal also included million of other operating income see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these charges and credits are all pre tax amounts 
income tax expense for fiscal included million of tax benefits that arose primarily from the resolution of international tax inquiries  the expiration of statute of limitations associated with international tax matters and activities related to the manufacturing restructure and workforce reduction 
net income for fiscal included an in process r d charge of million related to the acquisition of xignal see note to the consolidated financial statements  severance and restructuring expenses of million see note to the consolidated financial statements and million of other operating income see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these charges and credits are all pre tax amounts 
income tax expense for fiscal included a tax benefit of approximately million from the retroactive reinstatement to january  of the us federal r d tax credit under the tax relief and health care act of enacted into law during fiscal of the million  million was related to fiscal r d expenses and million was related to fiscal r d expenses 
the tax benefit from the federal r d tax credit was partially offset by the non deductible nature of the in process r d charge related to the xignal acquisition 
net sales years ended in millions may  change may  change may  analog segment as a of net sales all others as a of net sales total net sales the chart above and the following discussion are based on our reportable segments described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the information for fiscal and has been reclassified to present segment information based on the structure of our operating segments in fiscal analog segment sales were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower overall demand from customers  particularly from customers in the wireless handset market  who were negatively affected by the sharp downturn in the overall global economy 
these industry conditions have also caused a significant decline in new orders from our distributors  who service a number of customers across a broad range of industries and markets 
unit shipments in our analog segment decreased percent in fiscal compared to the volume shipped in fiscal blended average selling prices increased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in blended average selling prices was driven mainly by improved sales mix from higher value products 
during fiscal  business units within the analog segment were reorganized into six operating segments which include advanced power  high speed product  infrastructure power products  mobile devices power  performance power products and precision signal path business units 
for purposes of this discussion  we have combined as one group the business units whose products are targeted for the power management market advanced power  infrastructure power products  mobile devices power and performance power products 
net sales from this group in fiscal compared to fiscal decreased by percent 
net sales from our high speed product and precision signal path business units in fiscal compared to fiscal decreased by percent and percent  respectively 
page of as part of the reorganization of business units within the analog segment  certain product families that were formerly included in the analog segment have been combined with a non analog business unit to form a new operating segment which is now included in the category described as all others 
for other operating business units included in all others  the decrease in sales for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to declining sales from non analog business units that are no longer a part of our core focus 
the sales from these non analog business units include sales generated from foundry and contract service arrangements 
for fiscal  net sales in our geographic regions decreased compared to fiscal by percent in the americas  percent in europe  percent in the asia pacific region and percent in japan 
regional sales as a percentage of total net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal were higher in the asia pacific region at percent and the americas at percent  but dropped to percent in europe and percent in japan 
the reported amount of net sales in us dollars related to foreign currency denominated sales in fiscal was favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily because the japanese yen strengthened over the fiscal year against the dollar 
although the euro weakened over the fiscal year against the dollar  its effect on foreign currency denominated sales in fiscal was immaterial 
the overall effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales reported in us dollars was minimal since less than percent of our total net sales were denominated in foreign currency and we have hedging programs intended to minimize the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
although net sales for the company in total were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal  net sales for our analog segment in fiscal were slightly higher than in fiscal due to increased sales for new analog products  primarily in the wireless handset and personal mobile device markets where we experienced growth associated with feature rich devices that utilize our analog solutions to enable features as well as to enhance power efficiency and battery life 
unit shipments of analog segment products were percent lower in fiscal compared to fiscal  but this decline in volume was favorably offset by higher blended average selling prices that increased percent in fiscal over fiscal the increase in blended average selling prices was driven mainly by improved sales mix from higher value analog products 
within the analog segment  net sales from our power management business units in fiscal grew percent compared to fiscal net sales from our precision signal path business unit in fiscal also grew percent compared to fiscal however  net sales from our high speed product business unit decreased in fiscal by percent compared to fiscal the decline in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal for other operating business units included in the category described as all others was primarily driven by a significant decrease in foundry sales associated with previously sold businesses 
this decline was consistent with our original plans and expectations 
for fiscal  net sales in our geographic regions compared to fiscal decreased by percent in the americas and percent in japan  while remaining relatively flat in the asia pacific region and increasing by percent in europe 
regional sales as a percentage of total net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal were higher in the asia pacific region at percent and europe at percent  while dropping to percent in the americas and percent in japan 
the reported amount of net sales in us dollars related to foreign currency denominated sales in fiscal was favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as both the euro and japanese yen strengthened over the fiscal year against the dollar 
however  the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales reported in us dollars was minimal since less than a quarter of our total net sales were denominated in foreign currency and we have hedging programs intended to minimize the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
gross margin years ended in millions may  change may  change may  net sales cost of sales gross margin as a of net sales page of our gross margin percentage decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a decline in factory utilization caused by significantly lower sales 
the decrease in gross margin percentage was somewhat offset by a favorable effect from lower expenses resulting from cost control measures 
despite a lower gross margin percentage  improved product mix of higher margin analog products continues to have a positive influence on our performance in gross margin percentage 
as part of that product mix improvement  our blended average analog selling prices in fiscal were higher compared to fiscal our analog product portfolio has continued to improve through active efforts to increase the portion of our business that comes from high value  high performance analog products that are more proprietary in nature 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization based on wafer starts was percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal gross margin includes share based compensation expense of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we achieved a higher gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal despite lower sales in fiscal compared to fiscal this higher gross margin percentage was due to improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and execution relative to the level of factory utilization combined with improved product mix of higher margin analog standard linear products 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization based on wafer starts was percent for fiscal compared to percent for fiscal research and development years ended in millions may  change may  change may  research and development as a of net sales the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects cost savings associated with the cost reduction actions announced in november and in fiscal combined with lower annual payroll and employee benefits expenses 
fiscal expenses also reflect savings from reduced discretionary spending in response to the weakening economic environment during the same time frame 
share based compensation expense included in r d expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal we are continuing to concentrate our research and development spending on analog products and underlying analog capabilities with particular emphasis on circuits that enable greater energy efficiency 
we continue to invest in the development of new analog products that can serve applications in a wide variety of end markets such as portable electronics  renewable energy products  communications infrastructure  industrial  medical  and sensing and detection applications 
because of our focus on markets that require or involve greater energy efficiency  a significant portion of our research and development is directed at power management technology 
r d expenses for fiscal exclude an in process r d charge of million related to the acquisition of actsolar  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the in process r d charge is included as a separate component of operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal although r d expenses in fiscal were at a comparable level to r d expenses in fiscal  we continued to increase our investment in research and development on analog product areas 
a decrease in share based compensation expenses more than offset higher spending in fiscal resulting from the acquisition of xignal in january  as well as higher payroll and employee benefits expenses 
share based compensation expense was million in fiscal selling  general and administrative years ended in millions may  change may  change may  selling  general and administrative as a of net sales although selling  general and administrative expenses were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal  sg a expenses include credits of million in fiscal and million in fiscal these credits represent a reduction in the liability associated with the employee deferred compensation plan due to a decline in the market value of the employees corresponding investment assets in the plan 
see discussion of the corresponding losses on the employees investment page of assets described in the paragraph  other non operating expense income  net 
excluding the effect from the reduction in this liability associated with the deferred compensation plan  the decrease is primarily due to lower share based compensation expense and lower annual payroll and employee benefit expenses which were partially offset by higher legal expenses related to intellectual property matters 
share based compensation expense for fiscal included in sg a expenses was million compared to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were higher in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to higher payroll and employee benefit expenses  which more than offset a decrease in share based compensation expense 
share based compensation expense was million in fiscal severance and restructuring expenses related to cost reduction programs our fiscal results include a net charge of million for severance and restructuring expenses related to the actions described below in march  we announced that we would take actions to reduce overall expenses in response to weak economic conditions and related business levels 
as part of the plan  we eliminated approximately positions worldwide 
in addition  we plan to further reduce headcount by approximately over the next months through the eventual closure of our wafer fabrication facility in arlington  texas and our assembly and test plant in suzhou  china 
as a result of these actions  we expect to incur total charges of approximately million to million  primarily for severance  asset disposals and other exit related costs 
we recorded million in fiscal  which includes severance costs of million  asset impairment charges of million and other exit related costs of million associated with closure and transfer activities incurred in fiscal in november  we announced a global workforce reduction that eliminated approximately positions 
we also closed two design centers located in the united states 
as a result of this action  we recorded severance and restructuring expenses of million in fiscal  which includes severance costs of million  other exit related costs of million and million for the impairment of abandoned equipment 
in addition to the actions described above  we recorded a net charge of million related to the workforce reduction and manufacturing restructure announced in fiscal this amount includes a million charge for other exit related costs that was partially offset by a recovery of million 
for a more complete discussion of these actions and related charges  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our fiscal results included a net charge of million for severance and restructuring expenses 
we recorded million primarily for severance and equipment impairment as part of an action announced in january to modernize our facilities and rationalize our capacity 
we also recorded a charge of million for severance related to a workforce reduction announced in april as part of our efforts to strategically align resources in connection with our focus on revenue growth in key market areas that require better power management and energy efficiency 
in addition  severance and restructuring expenses for fiscal included a recovery of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these actions and related charges 
our fiscal results included a net charge of million for severance and restructuring expenses arising from actions in scotland and texas related to the conversion and upgrading of our wafer manufacturing capacity in those facilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these actions and related charges 
charge for acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of actsolar  inc in march  we allocated million of the total purchase price to the value of in process r d 
this amount was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed for the technology 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of the acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition of xignal in fiscal  we allocated million of the total purchase price to the value of in process r d  which was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed for the technology 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of the acquisition 
page of interest income years ended in millions may  may  may  interest income the decrease in interest income in fiscal  and is due to lower interest rates on lower cash balances in each of those fiscal years 
interest expense years ended in millions may  may  may  interest expense the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to lower interest rates related to our debt that has floating interest rates and a lower overall debt balance 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to substantially higher debt balances associated with the debt transactions completed in june and july as part of the financing for our accelerated stock repurchase see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion 
other non operating expense income  net years ended in millions may  may  may  loss gain on investments charitable contribution total other non operating expense income  net the components of other non operating expense income  net are primarily derived from activities related to investment assets 
the loss on investments in fiscal reflects a decline in the market value of the investment assets held in a trust for the employee deferred compensation plan  which is partially offset by a million gain from a non marketable investment not associated with the deferred compensation plan 
as described in the paragraph  selling  general and administrative  sg a expenses for the same period include the related credit pertaining to the corresponding liability 
the loss on investments in fiscal reflects a decline in the market value of the investment assets described above  which was offset by a small gain from a non marketable investment 
the gain on investments in fiscal reflects the change in unrealized holding gains and losses from trading securities  which is partially offset by impairment losses on non marketable investments 
income tax expense years ended in millions may  may  may  income tax expense effective tax rate the effective tax rate was higher for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the write down of foreign deferred tax assets that resulted from a tax holiday granted by the malaysian government that will be effective for a ten year period beginning in our fiscal the effect of the write down of foreign deferred tax assets was partially offset by the tax benefits associated with r d tax credits  net of the portion of the tax benefit that did not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold see note to the consolidated financial statements 
page of the effective tax rate was lower for fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in tax benefits recognized that arose primarily from the resolution of international tax inquiries and the expiration of statute of limitations associated with international tax matters 
the effective tax rate for fiscal includes a tax benefit of approximately million from the retroactive reinstatement to january  of the us federal r d tax credit under the tax relief and health care act of enacted into law during fiscal of the million  million was related to fiscal r d expenses and million was related to fiscal r d expenses 
the tax benefit from the federal r d tax credit was partially offset by the non deductible nature of the in process r d charge related to the xignal acquisition 
we adopted fin effective at the beginning of fiscal the cumulative effect of applying fin was a million increase to retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal historically  we had classified unrecognized tax benefits as current income taxes payable 
under fin  we now classify unrecognized tax benefits as long term income taxes payable except to the extent we anticipate cash payment within the next year 
any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate 
our ability to realize the net deferred tax assets million at may  is primarily dependent on our ability to generate future us taxable income 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize these tax assets 
our ability to utilize these tax assets is dependent on future results and it is therefore possible that we will be unable to ultimately realize some portion or all of the benefits of these recognized deferred tax assets 
this could result in additions to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and an increase to tax expense 
share based compensation expense our operating results include the recognition of share based compensation expense under sfas no 
r  which totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the overall decrease in our share based compensation expense in each fiscal year is primarily due to the drop off of higher compensation expense from stock options granted prior to fiscal that generally had higher computed fair values due mainly to the volatility component of the fair value computation 
for further information and a description of our share based compensation plans  see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign operations our foreign operations include manufacturing facilities in the asia pacific region and europe and sales offices throughout the asia pacific region  europe and japan 
a portion of the transactions at these facilities is denominated in local currency  which exposes us to risk from exchange rate fluctuations 
our exposure from expenses at foreign manufacturing facilities during fiscal was concentrated in uk pound sterling  malaysian ringgit and chinese rmb 
where practical  we hedge net non us dollar denominated asset and liability positions using forward exchange and purchased option contracts 
our exposure from foreign currency denominated revenue is limited to the japanese yen and the euro 
we hedge up to percent of the notional value of outstanding customer orders denominated in foreign currency using forward exchange contracts and over the counter foreign currency options 
a portion of anticipated foreign sales commitments is at times hedged using purchased option contracts that have an original maturity of one year or less 
financial market risks we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we use derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
although there has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets  the credit quality of our investment portfolio classified as cash and cash equivalents remains very high 
our investment portfolio is mainly comprised of debt instruments that are with a a or better rated issuers  of which the majority is rated aa aa or better 
we limit our exposure to any one counterparty by diversifying our investments and continually evaluating each counterparty s relative credit standing 
as of may   the total credit exposure from most single counterparties did not exceed million with the exception of aaa rated government backed bonds and deposits 
our debt instruments also have very short average maturities that are generally less than a month  and we have not encountered any delays or disruption in their redemptions or maturities nor have we experienced any losses in connection with our cash investments 
page of approximately million of our long term debt has floating interest rates whereby an increase in the reference interest rate increases our interest expense and likewise  a decrease in the reference interest rate decreases our interest expense 
at our current debt levels  a change in the london interbank offered rate  or libor  of one percentage point would result in a corresponding change in our interest expense of up to approximately million annually 
although interest rates decreased in fiscal  there is no guarantee that rates will continue to decrease 
moreover  decreases in interest expense would be mitigated by decreases in interest income earned from our large cash portfolio 
likewise  if interest rates were to increase  it is likely that both our floating rate debt interest expense and our interest income on cash would increase 
the remainder of our long term debt totaling approximately million has fixed interest rates and is not affected by changes in interest rates 
a series of decreases in interest rates has a significant effect on the amount of interest income we earn from our cash portfolio due to the short term nature of the major portion of our cash portfolio 
at the same time  interest expense would be positively affected since as noted above  a portion of our long term debt has floating interest rates 
a significant portion of the floating interest rate debt can be repaid at any time without incurring prepayment penalties 
a substantial majority of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen  pound sterling  euro and various other asian currencies 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we have established programs to hedge our exposure to these changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
an adverse change defined as percent in all currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of less than million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices 
all of these potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed as of may liquidity and capital resources years ended in millions may  may  may  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents the primary factors contributing to the changes in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal  and are described below during fiscal  cash from operating activities was generated by net income  adjusted for non cash items primarily depreciation and amortization  and share based compensation expense  combined with a positive effect from changes in working capital components 
the positive changes in working capital were mainly attributable to decreases in receivables and inventories 
these positive changes were partially offset by the negative change from decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  as well as the decrease in other non current liabilities from losses realized on the investment assets related to the employee deferred compensation plan and a contribution made to one of our defined benefit pension plans 
in fiscal  cash from operating activities was generated by net income  adjusted for non cash items primarily depreciation and amortization  and share based compensation expense and a positive effect from changes in working capital components 
changes in working capital that had a positive effect were attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and decreases in inventories and other assets  which were partially offset by a decrease in other non current liabilities 
in fiscal  cash from operating activities was positively affected by net income  adjusted for non cash items primarily depreciation and amortization  and share based compensation expense 
this was partially offset by a negative impact from changes in working capital components  primarily caused by a significant decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses that was partially offset by decreases in receivables and inventories

the primary use of cash for investing activities in fiscal was for investment in property  plant and equipment of million  mainly representing the purchase of machinery and equipment  and a business acquisition  net of cash acquired for million 
these amounts were offset by the sale and maturity of available for sale securities of million 
the primary use of cash for financing activities in fiscal was for the repurchase of million shares of our common stock in the open market for million and payments of million for principal payments on the unsecured bank term loan and million for cash dividends 
these amounts were partially offset by cash proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefits plans 
the primary use of cash for financing activities in fiscal was for the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for billion  which included the delivery of million shares of our common stock repurchased under the billion accelerated share repurchase program 
the remaining shares were repurchased in the open market 
we also used cash for financing activities for the payments of million for cash dividends  million on the unsecured bank term loan and million related to tax withholdings paid on behalf of employees for net share settlements 
these amounts were partially offset by cash proceeds of billion net of issuance costs that came from new debt  which included billion unsecured senior notes issued through a public offering and a million unsecured credit facility with a consortium of banks funded in fiscal cash proceeds also included million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
financing activities in fiscal also include an additional billion of cash received from the unsecured bridge credit facility that was used to finance the accelerated stock repurchase and an additional payment of billion for its full repayment after completing the billion unsecured senior note offering and the million unsecured credit facility with a consortium of banks

these amounts were partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
in february  we amended the credit agreement associated with our unsecured term loan with a consortium of banks 
the amendment increased the interest rate to be  at our option  equal to either the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin of between percent and percent depending on our public debt ratings from moody s and s p  or an applicable margin of between percent and percent depending on our public debt ratings from moody s and s p plus the greater of one of the following rates a the publicly announced prime rate set by bank of america and publicly announced as its prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus percent or c libor plus percent 
the amendment also reduced the minimum interest coverage ratio covenant beginning the first quarter of fiscal through the first quarter of fiscal and increased the maximum leverage ratio covenant beginning the third quarter of fiscal through the first quarter of fiscal the amendment also clarified the definition of consolidated adjusted ebitda to allow further exclusion of certain restructuring expenses for purposes of such covenant calculations 
in addition  we agreed to make a principal prepayment of million  which was paid in march and reduced the amount of each of the last four installments due under the loan to million from million 
we believe the amendment will enable us to be in compliance with the requirements of all covenants for the foreseeable future 
as of may   we had a balance of million remaining available for future common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program announced in june on june   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock  which was paid on july  to shareholders of record at the close of business on june  we anticipate that our fiscal capital expenditures will be lower than the fiscal amount 
we will continue to manage the level of capital expenditures relative to sales levels  capacity utilization and industry business conditions 
in connection with the cost reduction actions that we announced in march  we expect to pay the majority of the related severance by the end of our fiscal first quarter 
we expect that existing cash and investment balances  together with existing lines of credit and cash generated by operations  will be sufficient to finance the capital investments currently planned for fiscal  as well as the severance payments  and principal and interest payments due on our long term debt 
however  we cannot assure that if economic conditions were to substantially further deteriorate within the next year  we would have the appropriate financial resources to meet our business requirements 
our cash and investment balances are dependent in part on continued collection of customer receivables and the ability to sell inventories 
although we have not experienced major problems with our customer receivables  continual declines in overall economic conditions could lead to deterioration in the quality of customer receivables in the future 
since we no longer hold investments with maturities greater than days  we did not experience any major declines in our cash equivalents or marketable investments as a result of the continuing downturn in the financial markets 
however  major declines in financial markets could cause reductions in our cash equivalents and marketable investments in the future

we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might be established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we do not believe we are materially exposed to financing  liquidity  market or credit risks that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

outlook in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we saw signs of strengthening in our business  as new orders were up percent sequentially after they had been down percent sequentially in the preceding third quarter of fiscal a portion of the improvement in new orders was attributable to higher turns orders  which represent orders received with delivery requested in the same quarter 
while these turns orders came mostly from our distributors  we saw improvement in the amount of turns orders from our oem customers 
we also didn t experience as many cancellations and rescheduling of orders as we did in the previous third quarter of fiscal distributor inventories were reduced in the fourth quarter and we expect distributor inventories to remain low over the summer 
as a result of the improvement in order activity  our opening backlog as we entered the first quarter of fiscal was higher than the level it was when we began the fourth quarter of fiscal considering all factors  including those described above  we provided guidance for net sales in the first quarter of fiscal to increase approximately percent to percent sequentially from the level achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal however  if backlog orders are cancelled or if the currently anticipated level of turns orders is less than expected  we may not be able to achieve this projected level of sales 
as a result of the higher net sales outlook  we anticipate that our wafer fabrication utilization will rise slightly in the first quarter of fiscal consequently  we anticipate that our gross margin percentage will increase from what it was in the fourth quarter of fiscal depending on the sales level that we achieve 
the projected gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal also includes approximately million of share based compensation expense that is expected to be in cost of sales 
however  if there are further declines in factory utilization or changes in the expected sales level or product mix  our gross margin percentage could be unfavorably affected 
as discussed earlier  we announced in march that we have taken actions to reduce overall expenses in response to economic conditions and related business levels 
as part of the plan  we have eliminated approximately positions worldwide  and the majority of the affected employees will depart before the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  we intend to further reduce headcount by approximately over the next months through the eventual closure of our manufacturing facilities in texas and china in connection with our manufacturing consolidation plan 
as a result of these actions  we expect to incur total charges of approximately million to million  primarily for severance  asset disposals and other exit related costs  of which million was recorded in fiscal the remainder of the charges will be incurred over the next to quarters 
in connection with this action  cash outlays incurred and expected to be incurred in aggregate are estimated to be in the range of million to million  of which approximately million to million is related to severance payments 
upon final completion of all activities associated with this action  the company expects to realize gross savings of million to million per quarter 
these gross savings are in reference to spending levels the company was incurring prior to the announcement of this action
