overview we are an emerging medical device company that markets our advanced robotic arm solution and orthopedic implants for minimally invasive orthopedic knee procedures 
we offer makoplasty  an innovative  restorative surgical solution that enables orthopedic surgeons to consistently  reproducibly and precisely treat patient specific  early to mid stage osteoarthritic knee disease 
in february  our common stock began trading on the nasdaq global market under the ticker symbol mako and we closed our initial public offering  or ipo 
through december   our recognized revenue was primarily generated from the sale of our implants and disposable products utilized in knee makoplasty procedures 
in accordance with our revenue recognition 
table of contents policy as described in the critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates section below  upon customer acceptance of the sale of our tactile guidance system  or tgs  we deferred recognition of the related revenue and direct cost of revenue until delivery of the rio robotic arm interactive orthopedic system  or rio system  which is version of the tgs and which we plan to commercially launch in the first half of we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses as we increase our sales and marketing activities and otherwise continue to invest capital in the development and expansion of our products and our business generally 
we also expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase due to additional operational and regulatory costs and burdens associated with the rapid expansion of our operations and operating as a public company and due to the rapid expansion of our operations 
recent key milestones and goals in the development of our business during the year ended december  include the following in january  we obtained k marketing clearance from the us food and drug administration  or fda  for version of our tgs and commercially launched version of our tgs in the first quarter of in february  we completed the ipo of our common stock  issuing a total of million shares at an issue price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million  after underwriting discounts and commissions of million and expenses of approximately million 
in the second quarter of  we filed a k submission with the fda for version of our tgs 
we also received k clearance for our unicompartmental implant and k clearance for our patellofemoral implant  components of our intended multicompartmental implant strategy 
in the third quarter of  we finalized development of a tgs software application to enable our mako branded restoris unicompartmental knee implant system  or restoris  combining our tibial inlay and tibial onlay system 
we commercially introduced this software  version of our tgs  and restoris in the third quarter of tgs version did not require k clearance as the indications for use of restoris with the tgs were included and cleared as part of version of our tgs 
in october  we entered into a securities purchase agreement for an equity financing of up to million  with initial gross proceeds of approximately million  which we closed on october   and conditional access to an additional million  referred to as the second closing 
in connection with the financing  we issued and sold to the participating investors  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share and issued at the purchase price of per warrant to the participating investors warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in addition  at a purchase price of per warrant  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to investors that agreed to purchase an additional million of common stock in the second closing 
the financing resulted in net proceeds of approximately million  after expenses of approximately  in the fourth quarter of  we received k clearances from the fda to market both our rio system and our mako branded restoris mck multicompartmental knee implant system  or restoris mck  both of which we intend to commercially launch in the first half of we believe that the key to growing our business is expanding the application of makoplasty to multicompartmental resurfacing procedures by offering implants that address mid stage  multicompartmental knee degeneration 
to successfully commercialize our products and grow our business  we must gain market acceptance for makoplasty 

table of contents factors which may influence future results of operations the following is a description of factors which may influence our future results of operations  including significant trends and challenges that we believe are important to an understanding of our business and results of operations 
revenue revenue is generated from unit sales of our robotic arm systems  including installation services  training and upgrades and enhancements  from sales of implants and disposable products and sales of extended warranty service contracts 
to date  we have generated revenue primarily from the sale of implants and disposable products utilized in knee makoplasty procedures 
recognition of revenue associated with the sale of tgs units in our statements of operations is dependent upon satisfying all related revenue recognition criteria  which include the delivery of the rio system  which we anticipate to commercially launch in the first half of revenue related to future rio system sales will be recognized upon delivery and will not be deferred  as described in the critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates section below 
future revenue from sales of our products is difficult to predict and we expect that it will only modestly reduce our continuing and increasing losses resulting from selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development and other activities for at least the next two or three years 
our future revenue may also be adversely affected by the current general economic downturn and the resulting tightening of the credit markets  which may cause our customers to experience difficulties in securing adequate funding to buy our products or cause purchasing decisions to be delayed 
the generation of recurring revenue through sales of our knee implants  disposable products and service contracts are an important part of the makoplasty business model 
we anticipate that recurring revenue will constitute an increasing percentage of our total revenue as we leverage each new installation of our rio system to generate recurring sales of implants and disposable products and as we expand our implant product offering 
cost of revenue cost of revenue primarily consists of the direct costs associated with the manufacture of robotic arm systems  implants and disposable products for which revenue has been recognized or deferred in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
costs associated with providing services are expensed as incurred 
cost of revenue also includes the cost associated with establishing at the time of installation an accrual for the tgs standard one year warranty liability  royalties related to the sale of products covered by licensing arrangements and write offs of obsolete or impaired inventory 
the cost of revenue associated with the sale of tgs units is deferred until the recognition of the related revenue 
in addition  we expect that deferred costs of revenue associated with the sale of tgs units will be higher during the deferral period due to the additional costs associated with providing hardware enhancements and upgrades through and including the delivery of the rio system as described in the critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates section below 
in the third quarter of  we commercially introduced restoris  our mako branded unicompartmental implant system 
we also developed the rio system  which we anticipate commercially launching in the first half of in conjunction with the anticipated launch of restoris and the rio system  we discontinued portions of our current implant line and the manufacturing of our tgs 
as a result  we wrote off inventory totaling approximately  during the year ended december  relating to these product transitions 
depending on demand for our products and technical obsolescence  additional future write offs of our inventory may occur 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  including stock based compensation and benefits  for sales  marketing  operations  regulatory  quality  executive  finance  legal and administrative personnel 
other significant expenses include costs associated with sales and marketing activities  marketing and advertising materials  insurance  professional fees for legal and accounting services  consulting fees  travel expenses  facility and related operating costs  and recruiting expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase due to the cost associated with the commercial launch of our rio system and restoris mck  an increased number of employees necessary to support our continued growth in operations  and the additional operational and regulatory burdens and costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
in addition  we are currently taking preliminary steps to investigate the feasibility of establishing clinical sites outside the united states  which may also increase our selling  general and administrative expenses  and we expect to incur additional costs associated with securing and protecting our intellectual property rights as necessary to support our future product offerings 
research and development expenses costs related to research  design and development of products are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
these costs include direct salary and benefit costs for research and development employees including stock based compensation  cost for materials used in research and development activities and costs for outside services 
research and development expenses are expected to continue to increase as we research potential future products 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
the accounting estimates that require our most significant  difficult and subjective judgments include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and liabilities  impairment of long lived assets and the determination of stock based compensation 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in
