howard g 
berger  md is our president and chief executive officer  a member of our board of directors and owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
dr 
berger also owns  indirectly  of the equity interests in brmg 
brmg provides all of the professional medical services at the majority of our facilities located in california under a management agreement with us  and contracts with various other independent physicians and physician groups to provide the professional medical services at most of our other california facilities 
we generally obtain professional medical services from brmg in california  rather than provide such services directly or through subsidiaries  in order to comply with california s prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine 
however  as a result of our close relationship with dr 
berger and brmg  we believe that we are able to better ensure that medical service is provided at our california facilities in a manner consistent with our needs and expectations and those of our referring physicians  patients and payors than if we obtained these services from unaffiliated physician groups 
brmg is a partnership of pronet imaging medical group  inc  breastlink medical group  inc and beverly radiology medical group  inc 
 each of which are or owned by dr 
berger 
radnet provides non medical  technical and administrative services to brmg for which it receives a management fee  per the management agreement 
through the management agreement and our relationship with dr 
berger  we have exclusive authority over all non medical decision making related to the ongoing business operations of brmg 
based on the provisions of the agreement  we have determined that brmg is a variable interest entity  and that we are the primary beneficiary as defined in financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r  and consequently  we consolidate the revenue and expenses of brmg 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
at a portion of our centers in california and at all of the centers which are located outside of california  we have entered into long term contracts with prominent radiology groups in the area to provide physician services at those facilities 
these third party radiology practices provide professional services  including supervision and interpretation of diagnostic imaging procedures  in our diagnostic imaging centers 
the radiology practices maintain full control over the provision of professional services 
the contracted radiology practices generally have outstanding physician and practice credentials and reputations  strong competitive market positions  a broad sub specialty mix of physicians  a history of growth and potential for continued growth 
in these facilities we enter into long term agreements with radiology practice groups typically years 
under these arrangements  in addition to obtaining technical fees for the use of our diagnostic imaging equipment and the provision of technical services  we provide management services and receive a fee based on the practice group s professional revenue  including revenue derived outside of our diagnostic imaging centers 
we own the diagnostic imaging assets and  therefore  receive of the technical reimbursements associated with imaging procedures 
we have no financial controlling interest in the contracted radiology practices  as defined in eitf  accordingly  we do not consolidate the financial statements of those practices in our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we had a working capital balance of million and million at december  and  respectively 
we had net losses of million  million  million and million for the years ended december  and  the two months ended december   and the year ended october   respectively 
we also had a stockholders deficit of million and million at december  and  respectively 
we operate in a capital intensive  high fixed cost industry that requires significant amounts of capital to fund operations 
in addition to operations  we require significant amounts of capital for the initial start up and development expense of new diagnostic imaging facilities  the acquisition of additional facilities and new diagnostic imaging equipment  and to service our existing debt and contractual obligations 
because our cash flows from operations have been insufficient to fund all of these capital requirements  we have depended on the availability of financing under credit arrangements with third parties or have entered into capital leases 
our business strategy with regard to operations focuses on the following x maximizing performance at our existing facilities  x focusing on profitable contracting  x expanding mri  ct and pet applications  x optimizing operating efficiencies  and x expanding our networks our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt and other contractual obligations will depend on our future financial performance 
a range of economic  competitive  regulatory  legislative and business factors  many of which are outside of our control  will affect our financial performance 
taking these factors into account  including our historical experience and our discussions with our lenders to date  although no assurance can be given  we believe that through implementing our strategic plans and continuing to restructure our financial obligations  we will obtain sufficient cash to satisfy our obligations as they become due in the next twelve months

net revenue is reduced by the provision for bad debts  mobile pet revenue and other professional reading service revenue to obtain adjusted net revenue 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including o our reported amounts of assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  o our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and o our reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could differ materially from these estimates 
the securities and exchange commission  or sec  defines critical accounting estimates as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
in note to our consolidated financial statements  we discuss our significant accounting policies  including those that do not require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
the most significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition our consolidated net revenue consists of net patient fee for service revenue and revenue from capitation arrangements  or capitation revenue 
net patient service revenue is recognized at the time services are provided net of contractual adjustments based on our evaluation of expected collections resulting from the analysis of current and past due accounts  past collection experience in relation to amounts billed and other relevant information 
the amount of expected collection is continually adjusted as more information is received and such adjustments are recorded in current operations 
contractual adjustments result from the differences between the rates charged for services performed and reimbursements by government sponsored healthcare programs and insurance companies for such services 
capitation revenue is recognized as revenue during the period in which we were obligated to provide services to plan enrollees under contracts with various health plans 
under these contracts  we receive a per enrollee amount each month covering all contracted services needed by the plan enrollees 
accounts receivable substantially all of our accounts receivable are due under fee for service contracts from third party payors  such as insurance companies and government sponsored healthcare programs  or directly from patients 
services are generally provided pursuant to one year contracts with healthcare providers 
receivables generally are collected within industry norms for third party payors 
we continuously monitor collections from our clients and maintain an allowance for bad debts based upon specific payor collection issues that we have identified and our historical experience 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets we depreciate our long lived assets over their estimated economic useful lives with the exception of leasehold improvements where we use the shorter of the assets useful lives or the lease term of the facility for which these assets are associated 
deferred tax assets we evaluate the realizability of the net deferred tax assets and assess the valuation allowance periodically 
if future taxable income or other factors are not consistent with our expectations  an adjustment to our allowance for net deferred tax assets may be required 
even though we expect to utilize our net operating loss carry forwards in the future  the last three fiscal year losses and available evidence cause the valuation of our net deferred tax assets to be uncertain in the near term 
as of december   we have provided a full allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill at december  totaled million 
goodwill is recorded as a result of business combinations 
management evaluates goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach  which uses comparable market data 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
using the services of an external valuation expert  we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of october  based on our analysis  we recorded no impairment loss related to goodwill in however  if estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets 
derivative financial instruments the company holds derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging the risks of certain identifiable and anticipated transactions 
in general  the types of risks hedged are those relating to the variability of cash flows caused by movements in interest rates 
the company documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge  and  unless the instrument qualifies for the short cut method of hedge accounting  over the term of each hedging relationship 
our use of derivative financial instruments is limited to interest rate swaps  the purpose of which is to hedge the cash flows of variable rate indebtedness 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments are reported at fair value 
the gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge ie  change in fair value is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the company s consolidated statement of stockholders equity 
the remaining gain or loss  if any  is recognized currently in earnings 
amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into net income in the same period in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
medical malpractice insurance we and our affiliated physicians are insured by fairway physicians insurance company 
fairway provides claims made malpractice insurance coverage that covers only asserted malpractice claims made during the policy period and within policy limits 
to reduce our exposure to claims incurred but not reported under the annual policy  the company purchased an effective tail policy to cover all claims filed after december  relating to incidents prior to january   thus eliminating any liability for future claims made related to december  and prior

recent accounting pronouncements as discussed in note  we adopted the provisions of sfas as of january  for financial instruments 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas for non financial instruments in and do not expect this adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in us generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
we adopted the provisions of sfas as of january  for financial instruments 
although the adoption of sfas for financial instruments did not materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flow  we are now required to provide additional disclosures as part of our financial statements see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas for non financial instruments in and do not expect this adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas permits entities to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value  on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other us generally accepted accounting principles 
the fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
as we have not elected the fair value option allowed for by sfas for any assets or liabilities that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other us generally accepted accounting principals  the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations and sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
those standards were intended to improve  simplify  and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling minority interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  requires acquisition related transaction costs to be expensed  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we have not evaluated the potential impact that sfas r will have on our financial statements 
sfas is designed to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of financial information provided to investors by requiring all entities to report minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
moreover  sfas eliminates the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and minority interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
in addition  sfas shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements 
the presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
we currently do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our financial statements  however  the effect is largely dependent on potential future transactions which we are currently unable to forecast 
other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb including its emerging issues task force  the aicpa  and the sec did not  or are not believed by management to  have a material impact on our present or future consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we sell our services exclusively in the united states and receive payment for our services exclusively in united states dollars 
as a result  our financial results are unlikely to be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
a large portion of our interest expense is not sensitive to changes in the general level of interest in the united states because the majority of our indebtedness has interest rates that were fixed when we entered into the note payable or capital lease obligation 
on november   we entered into a million senior secured credit facility with ge commercial finance healthcare financial services 
this facility was used to finance our acquisition of radiologix  refinance existing indebtedness  pay transaction costs and expenses relating to our acquisition of radiologix  and to provide financing for working capital needs post acquisition 
the facility consists of a revolving credit facility of up to million  a million term loan and a million second lien term loan 
the revolving credit facility has a term of five years  the term loan has a term of six years and the second lien term loan has a term of six and one half years 
interest is payable on all loans initially at an index rate plus the applicable index margin  as defined 
the index rate is initially a floating rate equal to the higher of the rate quoted from time to time by the wall street journal as the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least of the nation s largest banks or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
the applicable index margin on each the revolving credit facility and the term loan is and on the second lien term loan is 
we may request that the interest rate instead be based on libor plus the applicable libor margin  which is for the revolving credit facility and the term loan and for the second lien term loan 
the credit facility includes customary covenants for a facility of this type  including minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  maximum total leverage ratio  maximum senior leverage ratio  limitations on indebtedness  contingent obligations  liens  capital expenditures  lease obligations  mergers and acquisitions  asset sales  dividends and distributions  redemption or repurchase of equity interests  subordinated debt payments and modifications  loans and investments  transactions with affiliates  changes of control  and payment of consulting and management fees 
on february   we secured an incremental million second incremental facility as part of our existing credit facilities with ge commercial finance healthcare financial services 
the second incremental facility consists of an additional million as part of our second lien term loan and the ability to further increase the second lien term loan by up to million and the first line term loan or revolving credit facility by up to an additional million sometime in the future 
as part of the transaction  partly due to the drop in libor of over since the credit facilities were established in november  we increased the applicable libor margin to for the revolving credit facility and the term loan and for the second lien term loan 
the additions to radnet s existing credit facilities are intended to provide capital for near term opportunities and future expansion 
as part of the financing  we were required to swap at least of the aggregate principal amount of the facilities to a floating rate within days of the close of the agreement on november  on april   effective april   we entered into an interest rate swap on million fixing the libor rate of interest at for a period of three years 
this swap was made in conjunction with the million credit facility closed on march  in addition  on november   we entered into an interest rate swap on million fixing the libor rate of interest at for a period of three years  and on november   we entered into an interest rate swap on million fixing the libor rate of interest at for a period of three years 
previously  the interest rate on the above million portion of the credit facility was based upon a spread over libor which floats with market conditions 
subsequent to year end  the company was able to modify two of its three interest rate swaps 
the modifications extended the maturity of  and re priced two existing interest rate hedges originally executed in for an additional months  resulting in an annualized cash interest expense savings of million 
on one of the libor hedge modifications for a notional amount of million of libor exposure  the company on january  replaced a fixed libor rate of with a new rate of maturing on november  on the second libor hedge modification for a notional amount of million of libor exposure  the company on february  replaced a fixed libor rate of with a new rate of also maturing on november  in addition  our credit facility  classified as a long term liability on our financial statements  is interest expense sensitive to changes in the general level of interest because it is based upon the current prime rate plus a factor
