item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates 
our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
at december   we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards nols of million for federal income tax purposes that expire beginning in and continuing through section of the internal revenue code section imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize nols if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
in the event of an ownership change  utilization of our nols would be subject to an annual limitation under section determined by multiplying the aggregate value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate which was for as of december  
any unused nols in excess of the annual limitation may be carried over to later years 
based on analysis that we performed  we believe we have not experienced a change in ownership as defined by section  and  therefore  our nols are not currently under any section limitation 
as a result of our common stock trading at depressed market prices in the last year relative to the prices at which our stock has generally traded during the previous three year period  the costs associated with acquiring a sufficient number of shares of our common stock to become a holder of or more of the outstanding shares has decreased significantly 
this decline in the cost of reaching the ownership threshold may increase the likelihood that we will experience an ownership change for purposes of section  as increases in share holdings by  or that result in a person becoming  a holder of or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock are aggregated for purposes of determining whether such a change has occurred 
although we cannot currently predict whether or when such an ownership change may occur  if we were to experience an ownership change under current conditions  our annual nol utilization could be significantly limited 
the imposition of this limitation on our ability to use our nols to offset future taxable income could cause us federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitation were not in effect and could cause such nols to expire unused  reducing or eliminating the benefit of such nols 
in addition  depending on the market value of our common stock at the time of any such ownership change  we may be required to recognize a significant non cash tax charge  the amount of which we cannot estimate at this time 
certain risk factors relating to our securities our securities have been and may continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally 
since mid  and particularly during the second half of  the air carrier industry and the securities markets generally were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity 
this was initially triggered by rapid and all time high fuel prices and general macroeconomic conditions  especially with regard to the housing and financial industries 
we may incur substantially more debt or take other actions that may affect our ability to satisfy our existing debt obligations including under our convertible notes and under our convertible senior notes collectively  the notes 
we are not restricted under the terms of the notes or the respective indentures for the notes from incurring substantial additional indebtedness in the future  including secured indebtedness or indebtedness at the subsidiary level  to which the notes would be structurally subordinated 
in addition  the limited covenants applicable to the notes do not require us to achieve or maintain any minimum financial results relating to our financial position or results of operations 
the governing indentures do not contain any restrictive covenants limiting our ability to pay dividends  make any payments on junior or other indebtedness  or otherwise limit our financial condition 
our ability to recapitalize  incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the notes could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when due  and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the availability of cash flow to fund our operations  working capital and capital expenditures 
we may not have the ability to repurchase our convertible senior notes in cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as required by the indenture governing the notes 
holders of our convertible senior notes have the right to require us to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change 
we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase such notes in cash or to make the required repayment at such time or have the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms 
a fundamental change may also constitute an event of default under  or result in the acceleration of the maturity of  our then existing indebtedness 
our ability to repurchase our convertible senior notes in cash may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at the time 
our failure to repurchase our convertible senior notes when required would result in an event of default with respect to such notes and could result in a cross default with respect to certain of our indebtedness 
our stock price has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile 
the price of our common stock  and therefore the price of the notes  may fluctuate significantly  which may make it difficult for holders to resell the notes or the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes when desired or at attractive prices 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
from january  through february   the sale price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange ranged from to per share  and the last reported sale price of our common stock on february  was per share 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly as a result of many factors in addition to the factors discussed in these risk factors 
these factors  some or all of which are beyond our control  include actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of securities analysts  success of our operating  growth and high priced fuel strategies  investor anticipation of competitive and industry threats  whether or not warranted by actual events  operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies or companies investors may deem comparable to us  news reports relating to trends in our industry or general economic conditions  and realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors 
in addition  the stock market can experience extreme volatility that often may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
because the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock  volatility or depressed prices of our common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of our notes 
holders who receive common stock upon conversion also will be subject to the risk of volatility and depressed prices of our common stock 
also  the existence of the notes may encourage short selling in our common stock by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock 
in addition  the issuance of the notes could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share in the future 
if our stock price fluctuates  purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors that are beyond our control 
the stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of securities of airline companies have been extremely volatile  and may reflect fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations could result in extreme fluctuations in the price of our common stock  which could cause purchasers of our common stock to incur substantial losses 
investors in our common stock may experience future dilution 
in order to raise additional capital  we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for  our common stock in transactions that may be dilutive to existing holders of our common stock 
the holders of our notes have certain redemption rights which become exercisable in we may elect to exercise rights to pay the redemption price of our notes in shares of our common stock which could result in the issuance of a significant number of additional shares 
the conversion ratio of our notes is subject to increase in connection with a make whole fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing such notes 
in connection with our letter of credit and revolving line of credit facility  we issued warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock for per share 
the number of shares issuable pursuant to such warrants as well as the shares of common stock issuable upon a conversion of our notes are subject to adjustments for certain dilutive events as defined in the warrant agreement and the respective notes indentures 
the issuance and sale of shares pursuant to our warrants and notes may result in substantial dilution to the proportionate equity interest and voting power of holders of our common stock 
the sale of such shares also has potential to cause significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock 
this is particularly the case if the shares being placed into the market exceed the market s ability to absorb the increased outstanding stock 
such an event could place further downward pressure on the price of our common stock 
this could present an opportunity for short sellers to contribute to a further decline of our stock price 
if there are significant short sales of our stock  the price decline that would result from such activity likely would cause the share price to decline  which  in turn  may cause persons who actually hold our stock to sell their shares thereby contributing to a further share price decline of our common stock in the market 
sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public markets  or the perception of such sales  could depress the market price of our notes and our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity related securities in the public markets  including in an offering of our common stock  could depress the market price of the notes  our common stock  or both  and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity linked securities 
we cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity related securities would have on the market price of our common stock or the value of the notes 
the price of our common stock could be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may occur involving our common stock 
this hedging or arbitrage could  in turn  affect the market price of the notes 
our anti takeover provisions may delay or prevent a change of control  which could adversely affect the price of our common stock or our securities convertible into common stock 
the existence of some provisions in our corporate documents and nevada law may discourage  delay  or prevent a change in control  which could adversely affect the price of our common stock or the price of the notes or our other securities convertible into common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control more difficult  including provisions relating to the nomination  election  and removal of directors  the structure of the board of directors  and limitations on actions by our shareholders 
in addition  nevada law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of ten percent or more of our outstanding common stock

overview all of the flight operations of airtran holdings  inc the company  airtran  or holdings are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary  airtran airways  inc airtran airways or airways collectively we  our  or us 
airtran airways is one of the largest low cost scheduled airlines in the united states in terms of departures and seats offered 
we operate scheduled airline service throughout the united states with a concentration in the eastern united states 
a majority of our flights originate and terminate at our largest hub in atlanta  georgia 
as of december   we operated boeing aircraft b and boeing aircraft b offering approximately scheduled flights per day to locations in the united states 
additionally  we have announced we will commence service to cancun  mexico and branson  missouri in the first half of and may add additional markets later in the year 
we offer very competitive fares by concentrating on keeping our unit costs low 
the enthusiasm and skill of our employees has also been a key to our success 
after a successful  during which we earned net income of million  we planned to grow our capacity as measured by available seat miles between ten and twelve percent 
our original strategy was based on a strong us economy and jet fuel prices consistent with levels 
however  during  the economic environment deteriorated  jet fuel prices increased to record high levels  and the credit markets tightened 
during  we undertook a variety of actions to respond to the challenges of the high and volatile cost of jet fuel and the deteriorating us economic environment  including reducing capacity starting in september  deferring new aircraft deliveries  selling aircraft  reducing other capital expenditures  implementing increases in certain fares and ancillary fees  entering into a variety of derivative financial arrangements to hedge the cost of fuel  and managing our costs and employment levels 
we also completed capital market transactions exceeding million  including placing convertible debt and common equity securities  entering into a letter of credit facility to reduce our exposure to holdbacks of cash remittances by a credit card processor  and obtaining a million revolving line of credit 
despite our efforts to increase unit revenues  control costs  and reduce capacity  after six consecutive years of profitability  we reported an operating loss of million and a net loss of million for included in our results are gains on the sale of assets of million  an impairment charge to write off goodwill of million and a non operating loss on derivative financial instruments of million 
the loss was primarily attributable to record high fuel prices during the first nine months of however  during the fourth quarter of jet fuel prices decreased dramatically and consequently we reported operating income for the fourth quarter 
the fourth quarter also includes non operating losses on derivative financial instruments which resulted in a pre tax loss and a net loss for the quarter 
recent operating results as summarized below  our fourth quarter of operating income improved compared to both the first nine months of and the fourth quarter of this improvement reflects reduced fuel prices as well as the adjustments we made to our business strategy  including the capacity reductions we implemented beginning in september selected unaudited financial and operating data in thousands  unless otherwise noted three months ended december  nine months ended september  three months ended december  operating revenue operating income loss net gain loss on derivative financial instruments net loss available seat miles asm total revenue per asm in cents operating cost per asm in cents average cost of aircraft fuel per gallon in dollars our losses for the year ended december   were driven primarily by record high jet fuel prices during the first nine months 
during the first nine months of  jet fuel prices including taxes and into plane fees averaged per gallon  however  during the fourth quarter jet fuel prices decreased to an average of per gallon 
the reduction in the average price of jet fuel resulted in a million decrease in our aircraft fuel cost during the fourth quarter compared to what fuel cost would have been had fuel prices remained at the average level experienced during the first nine months 
due largely to the decrease in average fuel prices  we reported fourth quarter operating income of million compared to an operating loss of million for the first three quarters of our fourth quarter operating income was also favorably impacted by a percent improvement in unit revenue as measured by total revenue per available seat mile compared to the first nine months of our fourth quarter unit revenue also improved by percent compared to the fourth quarter of the unit revenue improvement was attributable to both increased average fare and ancillary revenue levels 
additionally  our aggregate non fuel operating costs decreased million compared to the fourth quarter of as we reduced capacity as measured by available seat miles by percent 
due to the decrease in crude oil prices during the fourth quarter  we reported a million non operating loss on derivative financial instruments compared to a non operating loss on derivative financial instruments of million for the first nine months 
the fourth quarter non operating loss on derivative financial instruments combined with interest expense caused us to report a loss before income taxes of million for the fourth quarter 
implementation of our business strategy in prior to  we positioned ourselves as a growth airline 
we successfully grew our business at double digit rates annually from through and at a rate of percent in nevertheless  in  to respond to the challenges of a volatile fuel cost environment in much of  a weaker macroeconomic environment  and very adverse capital market conditions  we recast our plans in order to defer previously planned growth 
we implemented reductions in fleet size  capacity  and capital expenditures 
we reduced capacity principally by deferring scheduled aircraft deliveries  reducing utilization  and by selling b aircraft 
we reduced our capacity as measured by available seat miles in the last four months of from a planned ten percent increase to a reduction of approximately seven percent compared to the comparable period of we are also reducing capacity 
by adjusting our business strategy and implementing revised tactics  we believe we have positioned airtran airways to deal with the volatile fuel cost environment  current economic recession  and reduction in consumer demand 
we expect to be ready to resume our historical growth strategy when the business environment allows 
we made the following adjustments to our strategy to respond to the challenges of a volatile fuel cost environment and weaker macroeconomic conditions 
reduce the size of our operation and focus on strengthening established markets 
we recast our plans in order to defer previously planned growth and effected strategic reductions in fleet size  capacity  and operations 
more specifically  we reduced capacity by deferring scheduled aircraft deliveries and by selling b aircraft 
in  we entered into agreements to defer delivery dates for b aircraft originally scheduled for delivery between and to delivery dates between and as of december   we had on order b aircraft with delivery dates between and we have four b aircraft scheduled for delivery in and no aircraft scheduled for delivery in two of the scheduled aircraft deliveries are being sold upon delivery 
during  we sold eight b aircraft and recognized an aggregate gain of million related to the sales of these aircraft 
we may reduce or delay further growth in our fleet and are evaluating possible net reductions in our current fleet including via the sale of additional aircraft 
we anticipate several benefits from postponing our growth and reducing the size of our operation by deferring deliveries and selling aircraft 
first  we avoid the revenue ramp up period associated with entering new markets or expanding service in existing markets 
second  the sale of an aircraft generally results in a cash benefit because the sales proceeds tend to exceed the indebtedness associated with each sold aircraft 
third  the deferral of aircraft deliveries postpones our obligation to make pre delivery deposits and to arrange and incur permanent aircraft financing 
continue to aggressively cut costs and reduce non aircraft capital expenditures 
we reduced our average non fuel operating costs per available seat mile for each of the six years in the to period 
during  we managed our employment levels to match our planned capacity 
for the year as a whole  our non fuel unit cost was relatively flat 
in addition to continuing to seek ways to cut operating costs  we reduced non aircraft capital expenditures for by deferring or eliminating a variety of discretionary capital expenditures 
increase cash resources 
during  we completed capital market transactions exceeding million  including placing convertible debt and common equity securities  executing a letter of credit facility to reduce our exposure to holdbacks by a credit card processor  and arranging a million revolving line of credit 
during the second quarter  we accessed the capital markets through an offering of million shares of our common stock and through a concurrent offering of million of our convertible senior notes 
the net proceeds from these two offerings aggregated million 
in july  we obtained a commitment for a letter of credit facility pursuant to which a financial institution will provide one or more letters of credit in favor of our largest card processor 
the provision of the initial letter of credit resulted in a reduction in the cash remittances which such credit card processor would have otherwise been entitled to withhold from us 
in october  the letter of credit facility was amended to also provide for a revolving line of credit of up to million 
our repayment obligations with respect to the letter of credit and revolving line of credit facility are collateralized by certain of our assets 
as of december   million of the line of credit had been drawn by us and our unrestricted cash and short term investments aggregated million million including long term investments 
mitigate our fuel exposure 
we continued to seek to mitigate our fuel cost exposure by entering into a variety of hedging arrangements that provide partial protection against price increases 
for every dollar increase per barrel in crude oil or refining costs  our fuel expense for  before the impact of our derivative financial instruments  would increase approximately million  based on our projected level of operations 
we hedge our fuel cost exposure with a portfolio of swaps and various types of options using both crude oil and jet fuel as the underlying commodity 
however  our portfolio contains a variety of compound financial instruments including sold calls  which tend to limit the cash benefit of our hedges if jet fuel and crude oil prices increase beyond the call strike prices 
one effect of the recent decreases in the prices of crude oil and jet fuel has been the need for us to post significant cash collateral related to certain of our fuel related derivative agreements 
as of december   we had provided counterparties with collateral aggregating million  which represented approximately percent of the aggregate fair value of our fuel related derivative financial instrument obligations and our interest rate swap arrangements 
also  in response to the decline in fuel prices  we have elected to unwind certain of our other derivative agreements 
during the fourth quarter of  we realized losses of million of which million was paid in early january to unwind certain derivative financial arrangements pertaining to fuel requirements which decreased the gallons under hedges to approximately percent of our expected fuel requirements  which will continue to provide partial protection against price increases 
since september   we have revised the composition of our portfolio of fuel related derivative financial instruments in part to reduce our obligation to provide collateral to counterparties in the event of a decrease in the price of the underlying commodity 
more specifically  as of february   our portfolio contained relatively fewer collars and relatively more purchased calls 
increase revenues 
we implemented a number of fare increases beginning in september  which partially mitigated the impact of record high fuel prices during the first nine months of in addition to increasing fares  we also increased surcharge and ancillary revenues 
we implemented fuel surcharges and introduced fees for advance and priority seat selection  call center utilization  checked baggage and the purchase  extension or transfer a rewards 
as a result  our total revenue per available seat mile metrics for the fourth quarter of  and for as a whole  were record highs 
provide quality low fare service 
despite the need to make adjustments to our business strategy in  our strategy continues to place strong emphasis on providing superior and friendly service 
while third party assessments for are not yet available  in april  airtran airways was rated first in the highly regarded annual airline quality rating aqr study  developed in as an objective method for assessing airline quality 
airtran airways  ranked second the prior year  was one of only four airlines to improve its aqr score between and our most recent airline quality rating reflects monthly scores for the calendar year and is based on four major areas on time performance  denied boardings  mishandled baggage  and customer complaints 
researchers at the university of nebraska at omaha aviation institute and the w 
frank barton school of business at wichita state university conduct the study each year 
other accomplishments during  we carried in excess of million revenue passengers  joined the major trade association for the industry  air transport association ata  while also retaining membership in the air carrier association of america acaa  initiated service to burlington  vermont  columbus  ohio  harrisburg  pennsylvania  san antonio  texas  and san juan  puerto rico  launched new non stop routes such as milwaukee new york laguardia  and baltimore washington international los angeles  california  developed new functionality for a rewards members at http www 
airtran 
com including the ability to purchase additional credits  extend expiring credits  or give credits to other members  increased the value of the a rewards elite program by adding upgrade opportunities for elite fliers at the gate and improving conveniences at the airport  and announced that we will begin service to branson  missouri and cancun  mexico in we expect our mix of low fares  excellent customer service  an affordable business class product  and one of the youngest all boeing aircraft fleets will provide product value that customers will continue to find attractive 
outlook we will face challenges during managing costs and increasing unit revenues in the face of volatile fuel costs and a weak economy will continue to be a primary focus 
while fuel market prices have recently decreased dramatically  fuel prices remain volatile and may again increase in additionally  our revenues may be adversely impacted by recessionary macroeconomic conditions in the united states 
the pilots collective bargaining agreement became amendable in and is currently in mediation and the flight attendants collective bargaining agreement became amendable on december   the impact on our operating results of any new collective bargaining agreement is uncertain 
based on our current outlook  we expect to reduce capacity as measured by available seat miles by approximately four percent for compared to additionally  we expect our non fuel unit operating costs per available seat mile to increase six to seven percent compared to we expect our non fuel unit operating costs to increase primarily due to increases in aircraft maintenance costs due to the aging of both aircraft types  a contract cost increase for b engine repairs  and an increased number of heavy airframe checks for our b aircraft  higher employee compensation costs due to higher wage rates attributable to higher average employee seniority  increased pilot training expenses  higher airport rents and landing fees  and a higher percentage of leased aircraft 
our fuel costs in the first quarter are estimated to be between and per gallon  including taxes  transportation  and into plane fees and excluding the impact of our fuel risk management program 
this assumes a barrel crude oil and an jet fuel refining margin 
air travel in our markets tends to be seasonal  with the highest levels occurring during the winter months to florida and the summer months to the northeastern and western united states 
the second quarter tends to be our strongest revenue quarter 
results of operations compared to summary we reported an operating loss of million  net loss of million  and loss per diluted common share of for included in our results are gains on the sale of assets of million  an impairment charge to write off goodwill of million and a non operating loss on derivative financial instruments of million 
the losses were attributable primarily to record high fuel prices during the first nine months of however  during the fourth quarter jet fuel prices decreased dramatically and consequently we reported a fourth quarter operating profit of million 
for  we recorded operating income of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per common share of 
included in our results for are gains on the sale of aircraft of million  million loss on derivative financial instruments  and the write off of million of expenses related to the attempted acquisition of midwest air group midwest airlines 
operating revenues our operating revenues for the year ended december  increased million percent  primarily due to a percent increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues was largely due to a percent increase in passenger traffic as measured by revenue passenger miles rpms 
average yield per rpm was cents  percent higher than the year ended december  during the year ended december   our average passenger length of haul increased percent  an increase in average passenger length of haul tends to increase average fare and tends to reduce average yield 
load factor increased to percent  points higher than the prior year  resulting in a percent increase in passenger revenue per asm versus the year ended december  total unit revenue increased percent as a result of stronger loads and increases in ancillary revenues 
during  we moderated our growth by taking delivery of only eight b aircraft  selling eight b aircraft  and terminating early the lease of one b aircraft  bringing our total fleet to aircraft at year end 
while the aircraft fleet size was reduced by one unit  the average fleet size was percent higher in compared to as a result  our capacity  as measured by available seat miles asms  increased percent 
our traffic  as measured by rpms  increased percent  resulting in a percentage point increase in passenger load factor to percent 
other revenues for increased million percent 
other revenues include change and cancellation fees  direct booking fees  revenues derived from the sale of frequent flyer credits  additional and excess baggage fees and other miscellaneous revenues 
the increase in other revenues is attributable primarily to increases in direct booking fees  unaccompanied minor fees  change and cancellation fees  and baggage fees 
in late  we ceased offering cargo services 
other revenues for the year ended december  included million of cargo revenue 
operating expenses our operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million percent and increased percent on an operating cost per asm basis casm 
our financial results were significantly affected by the price of fuel and volatility of the price of fuel

the following table presents our unit costs  defined as operating expense per asm casm  for the indicated periods year ended december  percent increase decrease aircraft fuel salaries  wages and benefits aircraft rent maintenance  materials and repairs distribution landing fees and other rents aircraft insurance and security services marketing and advertising depreciation and amortization gain on sale of assets impairment of goodwill other operating total casm aircraft fuel increased percent on a cost per asm basis 
during  our fuel price per gallon  including taxes and into plane fees  increased percent from during to during during  we realized million in gains from fuel related derivative financial instruments which reduced fuel expenses 
distribution expense increased percent on a cost per asm basis primarily due to higher credit card fees paid to various credit card companies 
landing fees and other rents increased percent on a cost per asm basis primarily due to facility rental rate increases by various airports 
aircraft insurance and security services expense decreased percent on a cost per asm basis primarily due to negotiated lower rates for hull and liability insurance 
marketing and advertising costs decreased percent on a cost per asm basis because our asms increased more than marketing and advertising costs 
depreciation and amortization increased percent on a cost per asm basis primarily because a higher proportion of our fleet was owned during compared to also  additions to computer equipment and software increased depreciation and amortization expense 
gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  gain on sale of assets in each year consists primarily of gains on aircraft sales 
during the years ended december  and  we sold eight and two b aircraft  respectively 
impairment of goodwill expense for the year ended december  was million 
excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  such as trade names  are not amortized but are subject to periodic impairment tests in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
because current adverse industry conditions and our recent operating losses were indicators that our intangible assets may have been impaired  we prepared an assessment in accordance with sfas and concluded that all of our goodwill was impaired as of june   while our trademarks and trade names were not impaired 
consequently  we recorded a charge of million to write off the financial statement carrying value of all of our goodwill during other income expense other income expense  net increased by million to million for compared to we reported losses on derivative financial instruments of million for  compared to losses of million for interest income decreased million due to lower interest rates 
also  during  we recorded a million charge to interest income related to realized and unrealized losses on investments 
interest expense  including amortization of debt issuance costs  increased by million primarily due to the net effects of the following the favorable impact of lower interest rates applicable to variable interest rate debt due to declines in market interest rates  the unfavorable impact of debt service for our convertible senior notes issued in may  the unfavorable impact of debt service for our letter of credit and revolving line of credit facility obtained in  and a million charge related to debt issuance costs written off and prepayment penalties related to debt repayments from b aircraft sold during capitalized interest decreased by million

these amounts are classified as part of the cost of the aircraft upon delivery 
other income expense for includes million to write off the costs associated with the attempted acquisition of midwest airlines which was terminated in august income tax expense benefit our effective rate was percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate can differ from the percent composite statutory tax rate percent federal statutory rate plus the percent effective state tax rate due to changes in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  certain expenses which are not deductible for income tax purposes and non recurring discrete items related to restricted stock vesting 
non deductible expense items and discrete items tend to increase the effective tax rate when pre tax income is reported and tend to decrease the effective tax rate when a pre tax loss is reported 
also  during  we recorded an million charge to write off all of the carrying value of our goodwill 
because this write off is not deductible for income tax purposes  we did not record a tax benefit and consequently our effective tax rate was reduced 
income tax benefits recorded on losses result in deferred tax assets for financial reporting purposes 
we are required to provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to the extent management determines that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will ultimately not be realized 
we expect to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets including a portion of the deferred tax asset associated with loss carryforwards through the reversal of existing temporary differences 
however  we have determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets in excess of our deferred tax liabilities will not ultimately be realized  in part due to our cumulative losses over the past three years  and that we are therefore required to provide a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in excess of our deferred tax liabilities 
as a result  beginning with the third quarter of  our losses were not reduced by any tax benefit 
consequently  our effective tax rate for was substantially lower than the statutory rate 
as of december   we had recorded million of valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets 
regardless of the financial accounting for income taxes  our net operating loss carryforwards are currently available for use on our income tax returns to offset future taxable income

operating revenues our operating revenues for the year ended december   increased million percent  primarily due to a percent increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues was largely due to a percent increase in passenger traffic as measured by revenue passenger miles rpms  net of the impact of a decrease in our average yield per rpm of percent to cents 
the decrease in yield resulted primarily from an increase in the average stage length of percent to miles 
our average fare increased percent to 
the percentage point increase in load factor combined with the percent decrease in yield resulted in a percent increase in passenger unit revenues as measured by passenger revenue per available seat mile rasm to cents 
during the year ended december   we took delivery and placed in service ten b aircraft 
as a result  our capacity  as measured by available seat miles asms  increased percent 
the combination of our percent increase in capacity and percent increase in traffic resulted in a percentage point increase in passenger load factor to percent 
other revenues for increased million percent

changes in the air traffic liability balance and the related accounts receivable balance have had a significant impact on our net cash flow from operating activities 
we have a liability to provide future air travel because travelers tend to purchase air transportation in advance of their intended travel date 
advanced ticket sales  which are recorded in air traffic liability  fluctuate seasonally and also provide cash as we grow and consequently receive additional cash for future travel 
this source of cash will decline or change to a use to the extent we slow or reverse our growth or the amounts held back by our credit card processors increase 
during  our air traffic liability balance increased million contributing favorably to net cash used by operating activities
