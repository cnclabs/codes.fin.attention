table of contents results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal overview general the sales increase in  as compared with  was due to increased selling prices to recover higher raw material costs  sales unit volume increases  acquisitions and foreign currency translation effects 
the sales unit volume increase was due to improved sales demand in all reportable segments 
the largest sales unit volume increases were in the irrigation and coatings segments 
on a consolidated basis  sales unit volume increased approximately in  as compared with our costs for hot rolled steel products escalated rapidly throughout  resulting in higher costs for the items we manufacture 
where possible  we increased sales prices to our customers to recover these increased costs 
the gross margin gross profit as a percent of sales in the fiscal year was comparable to despite rapidly rising material prices  we were generally able to pass on these cost increases through higher selling prices to maintain gross margins 
on a segment basis in  improved gross margin in the coatings and utility segments offset weaker gross margin in the ess segment 
the increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  mainly resulted from increased salary and benefit costs to support the increase in sales activity approximately million  net effect of acquisitions and divestitures approximately million  foreign currency translation effects approximately million 
these increases were somewhat offset by lower group medical expenses for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with approximately million and decreased deferred compensation expense related to the investment losses in the marketable securities underlying the deferred compensation plan approximately million 
these investment losses resulted in lower amounts due to plan participants and  accordingly  reduced compensation expense 
we recorded these investment losses as other expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended december  the impact of these investments on the consolidated statement of operations in the fiscal year was not significant 
all reportable segments contributed to the improved operating income in as compared with the irrigation  utility and coatings segments realized the largest increases in operating income in  as compared with net interest expense for the fiscal year ended december  was slightly higher than  as the effect of higher average borrowing levels in on interest expense were offset by lower interest rates on our variable rate debt in  as compared with the increase in miscellaneous expense in  as compared with mainly related to investment losses in the assets in our deferred compensation plan of million and foreign currency exchange transaction losses in certain international operations 
our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended december  was higher as compared with our income tax rate in was lower than normal and was principally associated with the realization of certain income tax benefits on transactions that occurred in prior years 
these income tax benefits mainly related to the expiration of statutes of limitation 
other factors that contributed to a higher income tax rate in  as compared with  included higher taxes on our profits generated 
table of contents in china due to changes in their respective income tax laws in late and lower tax credits realized in the us in  as compared with our cash flows provided by operations were million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with million of cash provided by operations in the lower operating cash flows in principally resulted from increased accounts receivable and inventory in to support increased sales volume levels 
inventory levels also increased throughout due to rapidly rising steel prices and extended delivery times from our suppliers 
in response to these conditions  we increased inventory levels to ensure that we had materials on hand to meet our delivery commitments to our customers 
acquisitions and divestitures in and  we acquired the following businesses tehomet oy tehomet  a manufacturer of lighting structures located in finland and estonia acquired in april  penn summit tubular llc penn summit  a manufacturer of steel utility and wireless communication structures located in hazelton  pennsylvania acquired in january  west coast engineering group  ltd 
west coast  a manufacturer of steel lighting and wireless communication structures located in canada and the us acquired in february  site pro  inc site pro  a wireless communication components company headquartered in long island  new york acquired in july  gateway galvanizing gateway  a hot dipped galvanizing operation located near louisville  kentucky acquired in october  and  stainton metal co  ltd 
stainton  a manufacturer of steel lighting and wireless communication structures located in stockton on tees  england acquired in november in addition to these acquisitions  we acquired a small materials analysis  testing and inspection services business located in pittsburgh  pennsylvania and formed a pole manufacturing joint venture in turkey 
we report tehomet  west coast  site pro  the turkish joint venture and stainton as part of the ess segment 
we report penn summit and the engineering services company as part of the utility segment 
we report gateway as part of the coatings segment 
in addition  we divested certain operations that were included as part of our other businesses 
these operations included our tubing operation in waverly  nebraska  which we closed in late and our french machine tool accessory operation  which we sold to a third party in january the aggregate net increase of our net sales associated with these acquisitions and divestures for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with was approximately million 
the operating income net increase in fiscal over due to acquisitions and divestures was approximately million 
foreign currency translation for the fiscal year ended december   we realized approximately million of increased sales related to the financial statement translation of our international operations into us dollars 
these translation effects also resulted in an increase in operating income for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with of approximately million 

table of contents foreign currencies such as the euro and the brazilian real were stronger in relation to the us dollar through most of  as compared with accordingly  our sales denominated in those currencies translated to a higher amount of us dollars in  as compared with engineered support structures segment the sales increase for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with was due to the increased sales prices to recover higher steel costs approximately million  the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures approximately million and foreign currency translation impacts approximately million 
on a regional basis  sales unit volumes in north america were up modestly in  as compared with volumes in europe and china in were comparable with in north america  lighting and traffic structure sales in were higher than  due to a combination of the west coast acquisition and increased sales price increases 
in the transportation market channel  sales were slightly higher in  as compared with  as highway spending funded through the us federal and state programs was stronger than in sales in the commercial market channel in were slightly lower than  due predominantly to a weaker commercial construction market in the us sales of lighting structures to electrical utilities in lagged  due to the recent weakness in the residential housing market 
in europe  sales in local currency were higher in  as compared with due mainly to sales price increases to recover higher steel costs and the full year impact of the tehomet acquisition  offset somewhat by weaker volumes in france 
sales of lighting structures in china in were higher than  on both a quarterly and year to date basis  mainly due to continued market expansion and increased sales efforts 
sales of specialty structures products increased in  as compared with in north america  structure sales in the wireless communication market in improved over sales of wireless communication components increased due to the site pro acquisition 
sales of wireless communication poles in china were down in  as compared with we believe a major contributing factor to the decrease in wireless communication structures sales was reorganization of the chinese wireless communication industry  which is causing some delays in ordering patterns for structures 
segment operating income for the fiscal year ended december  was essentially unchanged from improved operating performance in the north american specialty structures operations approximately million  mainly due to the impact of actions taken in late to consolidate sign structure manufacturing operations  and the impact of the west coast  tehomet  site pro and mitas acquisitions approximately million contributed to segment operating income improvement 
these improvements were offset by lower factory productivity in our north american lighting structures operations and higher sg a expenses 
operating income from international operations was comparable to  as currency translation effects approximately million offset increased market development expenses and lower operating income in china  which included start up expenses related to our third plant in china 
this manufacturing facility began production in the third quarter of the impact of the stainton acquisition did not have a significant impact on operating income  as this acquisition was completed in november the increase in sg a expense for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  was mainly due to increased salary and employee benefit costs approximately million  acquisitions approximately million  and  foreign currency translation approximately million 

table of contents utility support structures segment the sales increase in the utility support structures segment for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  was mainly due to the acquisition of penn summit and sales price increases implemented to recover higher steel costs 
unit sales of transmission  substation and distribution pole structures to utility customers in were comparable to however  sales order flow in this segment was very strong in  as sales backlogs at december  more than doubled from the end of the increase in demand for utility structures was the result of continued investment by utility companies to improve the electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure in the united states 
gross profit increased in the fiscal year  as compared with  due to improved sales prices and factory operating performance this year 
the increases in sg a spending for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  was primarily due to the acquisitions completed in million and increased salary  benefits and incentive expenses related to the higher sales activity and operating profit levels approximately million 
coatings segment coatings segment sales for the fiscal year ended december  were above  mainly due to increased demand for galvanizing services  offset to an extent by lower selling prices 
in our galvanizing operations  pounds of steel galvanized including intersegment sales in the fiscal year ended december  increased over by approximately 
the volume increases were due to stronger industrial economic conditions in our market areas  including increased galvanizing services provided to our other operations in the us the increase in operating income in the fiscal year  as compared with were principally due to lower zinc costs  the impact of higher galvanizing volumes and improvement in our utilization of zinc 
the main reasons for the sg a spending increases in  as compared with  were higher employee compensation costs related to increased sales activity in and increased incentive expenses associated with improved operating income this year 
irrigation segment the increase in irrigation segment sales for fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due to a combination of improved sales volumes and higher selling prices to recover higher steel costs 
in global markets  higher farm commodity prices and net farm income in and resulted in improved demand for irrigation machines  although market demand in the fourth quarter of was below levels 
we believe that the slowdown late in was due in part to uncertainty in general economic conditions and lower farm commodity prices in the latter part of sales demand in international markets was stronger in  as compared with  in most geographic regions  with the most significant sales increases taking place in brazil  the middle east and the pacific rim 
in north america  demand for irrigation machines and service parts in was also enhanced due to machines that were damaged by a pattern of severe storms in the us the increase in operating income for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  was due to improved sales volumes  sales price increases to offset steel cost increases and operating leverage realized through control of sg a spending 
the increase in sg a in  as compared with  was mainly attributable to increased employee incentives associated with improved operational performance approximately million and increased salary and benefit expense for additional administrative personnel approximately million 

table of contents other this mainly includes our tubing  industrial fastener and french machine tool accessories operations 
the sales decrease in the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  was due to the sale of our machine tool accessory operation in early and the closure of a small tubing facility in late the impact of these actions on our operating income was not significant 
net corporate expense the decrease in net corporate expenses for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  was mainly due to lower employee incentives  mainly due to a lower common stock price at year end  which is used to value long term management incentives approximately million  and  lower deferred compensation liabilities related to investment losses in the assets in the deferred compensation plan of approximately million 
this plan is a non qualified defined contribution plan 
the investment losses resulted in lower amounts due to the plan participants  which we recorded as a reduction of compensation expense 
we recorded these investment losses in the underlying plan assets as other expense in our consolidated statement of operations in fiscal compared with fiscal overview the sales increase in  as compared with  mainly reflected improved sales volumes in all reportable segments 
sales price increases to recover increased material costs and the effects of foreign currency translation also contributed to the improvement in net sales 
the most significant sales volume increases were realized in the irrigation and engineered support structures ess segments 
in april  we completed the acquisition of of the shares of tehomet oy tehomet  a manufacturer of lighting structures in finland 
the operations of tehomet were included in our financial statements starting at the date of acquisition 
the improvement in gross profit margin gross profit as a percent of sales in over was mainly due to improved factory performance associated with higher volumes and higher average sales prices combined with moderating raw material prices 
selling  general and administrative sg a spending in increased over levels by approximately million 
this increase was mainly due to higher employee incentives related to improved operating performance approximately million  increased salary and employee benefit costs approximately million  higher sales commissions associated with the increased sales volumes approximately million and the effects of foreign currency translations approximately million 
the decrease in net interest expense in  as compared with  was primarily due to higher interest income associated with increased interest bearing cash investments that resulted from our positive cash flow in average borrowing levels in were slightly lower than  which resulted from operating cash inflows that were used to pay down our interest bearing debt  offset to a degree by the debt that was incurred to finance the tehomet acquisition 
our effective tax rate in  while comparable to  was affected by a number of significant items 
in  we recorded million in income tax valuation allowances that related to our net operating loss and asset tax carryforwards in our mexican subsidiary 
in the fourth quarter of  mexico enacted a tax law change that effectively instituted a minimum tax on corporations  including those with net operating loss carryforwards 
we determined that it was necessary to reduce the 
table of contents recorded value of these net operating loss carryforwards in our financial statements 
this was offset by approximately million in certain unrecognized income tax benefits related to activities in prior tax years that were recorded as a reduction in income tax expense in in the third quarter of  due to the expirations of united states statutes of limitation 
we had previously determined that these tax benefits were not likely to be realized and therefore had not recognized these benefits in prior years 
in  china enacted a change in its income tax law that was intended to harmonize income tax rates for all companies operating in china 
as a result  we revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the new income tax rates  resulting in a million decrease in income tax expense in our income tax rate in was also favorably impacted by stronger earnings in our international operations 
these locations outside the united states generally have lower statutory income tax rates than the us  contributing to a slightly overall lower effective income tax rate in as compared with miscellaneous income in was lower than  due mainly to a million settlement associated with a retirement plan of a former subsidiary in the first quarter of our share of the profits in our nonconsolidated subsidiaries in improved over the most significant reason for the improvement was losses incurred in our owned structures operation in mexico in in the fourth quarter of  we purchased the remaining of this subsidiary from the majority owner 
our cash flows provided by operations were million in  as compared with million in the higher operating cash flows in resulted from improved net earnings in and the timing of income tax payments 
this improvement was offset to a degree by higher working capital associated with higher overall business levels in as compared with and distributions made from our nonqualified deferred compensation plan in in  our capital expenditures were million  as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the increased capital spending in was mainly due to manufacturing capacity expansions in the ess and utility support structures segments 
engineered support structures ess segment general the sales increase in the ess segment in  as compared with  was the result of improved sales volumes in all geographic regions 
the sales increase was mainly due to improved sales volumes  the impact of foreign currency translation approximately million and the tehomet acquisition that was completed in april million 
on a product line basis  sales improved in all of the major product lines in  as compared with gross profit increased at a slightly lower rate than sales  mainly as a result of steel and other raw material price increases in china that were not recoverable in the form of higher sales prices 
in addition  changes in tax laws enacted in china in limited our ability to recover value added taxes on our sales to customers outside of china added to our costs and reduced gross profit margins 
the most significant reasons for the increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in  as compared with  was currency translation million  increased sales commissions due to increased sales volumes million  the impact of the tehomet acquisition million and increased employee salary and benefit costs million 
the improvement in segment profitability in  as compared with  was also due to approximately million in severance and equipment disposal costs incurred in europe in lighting and traffic products in north america  lighting and traffic structure sales in increased modestly over levels 
in the transportation lighting market  sales were comparable in  as compared with this market is largely funded through us federal highway legislation and spending by the various states on road construction and improvement projects 
in  there were some delays in federal funding 
table of contents appropriations for road and highway projects  which we believe contributed to sluggishness in orders and shipments 
in addition  some budget weakness in certain states also caused some road and highway projects to be delayed 
these factors  we believe  contributed to some slowness in sales orders and shipments in  as compared with sales in the commercial lighting market channel increased in  as compared with  due primarily to improved orders from and expanding relationships with lighting fixture manufacturers 
in the international markets  sales of lighting structures in europe were higher in  as compared with this improvement was the result of good economic conditions in most of our key markets  especially france 
the improvement in lighting structure sales more than offset the effect of reduced tramway structure sales in europe in  as compared with lighting sales in europe were also enhanced by the tehomet acquisition 
lighting structure sales in china for were comparable with specialty products the increase in specialty structure sales in  as compared with  was due to strong sales of wireless communication structures in china 
the strong demand for wireless communication structures in china was due to the continuing development by wireless communication companies of their infrastructure to support the continuing growth and development of wireless voice and data communication in china 
in north america  the sales volume of wireless communication structures and components in was similar to sales of sign structures were lower in than  due in part to our decision in late to consolidate certain facilities that produce sign structures 
we believe that this action will help us better serve our markets and reduce operating costs in the future 
utility products this product line mainly includes that sale of utility structures outside of north america 
the main reason for the increased sales in this product line in  as compared with  was stronger sales of utility structures in china and various other international markets 
we expect sales of utility structures in china will grow in the future to support economic growth and china s efforts to develop its electrical energy infrastructure 
we also continue to experience opportunities to serve markets outside of china  using our chinese operations as a competitive way to serve these markets 
utility support structures segment in the utility support structures segment  the sales increase experienced in  as compared with  was the result of sales volumes improvement as well as improved sales prices 
we continue to experience strong sales order rates and backlogs in the business 
the electrical utility companies and independent power producers have continued their high level of infrastructure spending related to improving the quality  reliability and capacity of the electrical transmission grid 
gross profit increased at a greater rate than sales in  as compared with this improvement mainly was associated with an improved product sales mix  improved factory performance related in part to higher sales volumes  moderating material cost inflation and improved product pricing 
sg a expenses increased in  as compared with  due primarily to increased employee incentives due to improved operational performance million  higher employee salary and benefit costs to support the higher sales levels million and the consolidation of our mexico operation million 
coatings segment coatings segment sales in were above levels  mainly due to higher sales prices and increased demand for galvanizing services 
in our galvanizing operations  pounds of steel galvanized in 
table of contents increased over by approximately 
the volume increases were due to stronger industrial economic conditions in our market areas  including increased galvanizing services provided to our other operations in the us the increase in operating income in  as compared with  was due to higher production levels and improved production efficiencies  offset to a degree by a gain of million on the sale of one of our facilities in the third quarter of operating income in was affected by a valuation charge of approximately million related to the disposal of manufacturing equipment in our anodizing operation 
sg a spending in was comparable to irrigation segment for the fiscal year ended december   the sales increase in the irrigation segment  as compared with  was predominantly due to higher sales volumes 
in north america  historically high farm commodity prices and strong net farm income in resulted in improved demand for irrigation machines 
in addition  relatively dry growing conditions in contributed to increased after market parts sales in our major north american markets 
international sales increased in  as compared with  also due to higher farm commodity prices  which resulted in improved demand for irrigation machines 
on a regional basis  the sales improvement was broad based  as we experienced sales improvements in most geographic regions which more than offset sales weakness in brazil 
gross profit in the irrigation segment in  as compared with  increased at a higher rate than sales 
the strong sales demand in this segment resulted in better factory utilization and more than offset the effects of inflation in our raw material inputs 
the most significant factors resulting in the increase in sg a spending in  as compared with  were increased salary and benefit expense for additional administrative personnel to support the level of business million  increased employee incentives associated with improved operational performance million  and increased spending for new product development approximately million 
other this includes our tubing and industrial fastener operations  our machine tool accessories operation in france and the development costs associated with our wind energy structure initiative 
we made the decision to suspend our wind energy initiative in the fourth quarter of the main reasons for the improvement sales in  as compared with  were improved demand for industrial tubing especially for grain handling applications and improved demand for machine tool accessories in europe 
the improvement in operating income this year was related to the improvement in sales  a favorable sales mix in tubing and the impact of suspending our wind energy structure initiative 
the suspension of wind energy development resulted in approximately million less expense in  as compared with the machine tool accessories operation was sold in january net corporate expense the increase in net corporate expense in  as compared with  was mainly related to approximately million of increased employee incentives due to improved earnings and common stock price which is used to value certain long term management incentives 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows working capital and operating cash flows net working capital was million at fiscal year end  as compared with million at fiscal year end the increase in working capital was mainly the result of higher accounts receivables and inventories associated with the sales increase 
table of contents in the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was as of december  as compared with at december  operating cash flow was million in  as compared with million in and million in the decrease in operating cash flow in  as compared with  resulted from increased receivables and inventories to support the growth in sales 
inventory levels also increased throughout due to rapidly rising steel prices and extended delivery times from our suppliers 
in response to these conditions  we increased inventory levels to ensure that we had materials on hand to meet our delivery commitments to our customers 
investing cash flows capital spending was million in  as compared with million in  and million in the largest capital spending projects related to manufacturing capacity additions in the ess and utility support structures segments 
due mainly to the growth in the utility support structures segment and the international side of the ess segment  we will be investing in manufacturing capacity to meet the market demand in these segments 
accordingly  we estimate that our capital expenditures to be approximately million 
we also made other investments and acquisitions over the past three years 
in  we invested an aggregate of for the penn summit  west coast  site pro  mitas  matco  gateway and stainton acquisitions 
in  we invested an aggregate of million for the tehomet acquisition  the remaining of the outstanding shares of our canadian lighting structure manufacturing facility million and certain assets of a galvanizing operation in salina  kansas million 
in  we invested a total of million in our mexican pole manufacturing joint venture  including million net of cash acquired for the remaining ownership in this entity 
financing cash flows total interest bearing debt increased from million in to million as of december  most of this increase related to the debt with the acquisitions completed in  offset to a degree by the scheduled debt repayments on our existing debt 
sources of financing and capital we have historically funded our growth  capital spending and acquisitions through a combination of operating cash flows and debt financing 
we have an internal long term objective to maintain long term debt as a percent of invested capital at or below 
at december   our long term debt to invested capital ratio was  as compared with at the end of fiscal this internal objective is exceeded from time to time in order to take advantage of opportunities to grow and improve our businesses 
we believe the acquisitions described above were appropriate opportunities to expand our market coverage and product offerings and generate earnings growth 
dependent on our level of acquisition activity  we expect our long term debt to invested capital ratio to remain below in our priorities in use of future cash flows are as follows fund internal growth initiatives in core businesses pay down interest bearing debt invest in acquisitions connected to our core businesses or an existing competency return money to our shareholders through increased dividends or common stock repurchases at appropriate share prices 
table of contents our debt financing at december  consisted mainly of long term debt 
we also maintain certain short term bank lines of credit totaling million  million of which was unused at december  our long term debt principally consists of million of senior subordinated notes that bear interest at per annum and are due in may we may repurchase the notes starting in may at specified prepayment premiums 
these notes are guaranteed by certain of our us subsidiaries 
million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks 
we may increase the credit facility by up to an additional million at any time  subject to participating banks increasing the amount of their lending commitments 
the interest rate on our borrowings will be  at our option  either a libor based on a   or month interest period  as selected by us plus to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to earnings before taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda  or  b the higher of the higher of a the prime lending rate and b the federal funds rate plus basis points plus  in each case  to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to ebitda  or libor based on a week interest period plus to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to ebitda at december   we had in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  at an interest rate of 
the revolving credit agreement has a termination date of october  and contains certain financial covenants that may limit our additional borrowing capability under the agreement 
at december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under this facility 
these debt agreements contain covenants that require us to maintain certain coverage ratios and may limit us with respect to certain business activities  including capital expenditures 
our key debt covenants are that interest bearing debt is not to exceed x ebitda of the prior four quarters and that our ebitda over our prior four quarters must be at least x our interest expense over the same period 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants related to these debt agreements 
our businesses are cyclical  but we have diversity in our markets  from a product  customer and a geographical standpoint 
we have demonstrated the ability to effectively manage through business cycles and maintain liquidity 
we have consistently generated operating cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures 
based on our available credit facilities and our history of positive operational cash flows  we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs 
financial obligations and financial commitments we have future financial obligations related to payment of principal and interest on interest bearing debt  including capital lease obligations  various operating leases and purchase 
table of contents obligations 
these obligations as of december  are summarized as follows  in millions of dollars contractual obligations total after long term debt interest unconditional purchase obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations long term debt principally consists of the million of senior subordinated notes and the bank revolving credit agreement million was outstanding at december  
we also had various other borrowing arrangements aggregating million at december  obligations under these agreements may accelerate in event of non compliance with covenants 
operating leases relate mainly to various production and office facilities and are in the normal course of business 
unconditional purchase obligations relate to purchase orders for zinc  aluminum and steel  all of which we plan to use in we believe the quantities under contract are reasonable in light of normal fluctuations in business levels and we expect to use the commodities under contract during the contract period 
at december   we had approximately million of various unrecognized income tax benefits that are not scheduled above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the timing of any potential tax payments 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating lease obligations to unaffiliated parties on leases of certain production and office facilities and equipment 
these leases are in the normal course of business and generally contain no substantial obligations for us at the end of the lease contracts 
we also have certain commercial commitments related to contingent events that could create a financial obligation for us 
our commitments at december  were as follows in millions of dollars commitment expiration period other commercial commitments total amounts committed thereafter standby letters of credit total commercial commitments the above commitments are loan guarantees of a non consolidated subsidiary in argentina that is accompanied by a guarantee from the majority owner to us 
we also maintain standby letters of credit for contract performance on certain sales contracts 
market risk changes in prices certain key materials we use are commodities traded in worldwide markets and are subject to fluctuations in price 
the most significant materials are steel  aluminum  zinc and natural gas 
over the last several years  prices for these commodities have been volatile 
the volatility in these prices was due to such factors as fluctuations in supply  government tariffs and the costs of steel making inputs 
we have also experienced volatility in natural gas prices in the past several years  especially in  
table of contents zinc prices rose rapidly and reached a record high price in late our main strategies in managing these risks are a combination of fixed price purchase contracts with our vendors to reduce the volatility in our purchase prices and sales price increases where possible 
we use natural gas swap contracts to mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on our operating income 
risk management market risk the principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and natural gas 
we normally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures except as described below  nor do we use derivatives for trading purposes 
interest rates our interest bearing debt is a mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
assuming average interest rates and borrowings on variable rate debt  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have an impact on interest expense of approximately million and million and  respectively 
foreign exchange exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency are not material  and therefore the potential exchange losses in future earnings  fair value and cash flows from these transactions are not material 
from time to time  as market conditions indicate  we will enter into foreign currency contracts to manage the risks associated with forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions that are in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations 
much of our cash in non us entities is denominated in foreign currencies  where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact our cash balances in us dollar terms 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately million in and million in we manage our investment risk in foreign operations by borrowing in the functional currencies of the foreign entities where appropriate 
the following table indicates the change in the recorded value of our investments at year end assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar 
in millions europe asia south america mexico south africa commodity risk natural gas is a significant commodity used in our factories  especially in our coatings segment galvanizing operations  where natural gas is used to heat tanks that enable the hot dipped galvanizing process 
natural gas prices are volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
our current policy is to manage this commodity price risk for of our us natural gas requirements for the upcoming months through the purchase of natural gas swaps based on nymex futures prices for delivery in the month being hedged 
the objective of this policy is to mitigate the impact on our earnings of sudden  significant increases in the price of natural gas 
our annual us gas requirements are approximately  mmbtu 
at december   he had no open natural gas contracts 

table of contents critical accounting policies the following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there is a substantial amount of management judgment used in preparing financial statements 
we must make estimates on a number of items  such as provisions for bad debts  warranties  contingencies  impairments of long lived assets  and inventory obsolescence 
we base our estimates on our experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
further  we re evaluate our estimates from time to time and as circumstances change 
actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
the selection and application of our critical accounting policies are discussed annually with our audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining an allowance for accounts receivable that will not ultimately be collected in full  we consider age of the accounts receivable customer credit history customer financial information reasons for non payment product  service or billing issues 
if our customers financial condition was to deteriorate  resulting in an impaired ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
warranties all of our businesses must meet certain product quality and performance criteria 
we rely on historical product claims data to estimate the cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
in determining the accrual for the estimated cost of warranty claims  we consider our experience with costs to correct the product problem in the field  including labor costs costs for replacement parts other direct costs associated with warranty claims the number of product units subject to warranty claims in addition to known claims or warranty issues  we estimate future claims on recent sales 
the key assumptions in our estimates are the rates we apply to those recent sales which is based on historical claims experience and our expected future warranty costs for products that are covered under warranty for an extended period of time 
our provision for various product warranties was approximately million at december  if our estimate changed by  the impact on operating income would be approximately million 
if our cost to repair a product or the number of products subject to warranty claims is greater than we estimated  then we would have to increase our accrued cost for warranty claims 
inventories we use the last in first out lifo method to determine the value of the majority of our inventory 
approximately of inventory is valued at the lower of cost  determined by the lifo method 
the remaining of our inventory is valued on a first in first out fifo basis 
in periods of rising costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in lower profits than fifo  because higher more recent costs are recorded to cost of goods sold than under the fifo method 
conversely  
table of contents in periods of falling costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in higher profits than the fifo method 
in and  we experienced substantially higher costs to produce inventory than in the prior respective years  due mainly to higher cost for steel and steel related products 
this resulted in higher cost of goods sold and lower operating income in and of approximately million and million  respectively  than had our entire inventory been valued on the fifo method 
in  prices decreased modestly and operating income would have decreased by approximately million in each year  had our entire inventory been valued on the fifo method 
we write down slow moving and obsolete inventory by the difference between the value of the inventory and our estimate of the reduced value based on potential future uses  the likelihood that overstocked inventory will be sold and the expected selling prices of the inventory 
if our ability to realize value on slow moving or obsolete inventory is less favorable than assumed  additional inventory write downs may be required 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions 
we have assigned useful lives to our property  plant and equipment and certain intangible assets ranging from to years 
we annually evaluate our reporting units for goodwill impairment during the third fiscal quarter  which coincides with our strategic planning process 
we assess the value of our reporting units using after tax cash flows from operations less capital expenditures discounted to present value and as a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis are the discount rate and the annual free cash flow 
we also use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the reporting units 
as allowed for under sfas no 
 we rely on our previous valuations for the annual impairment testing provided that the following criteria for each reporting unit are met the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination and the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin 
in the case of our reporting units  the above criteria have been met and no further evaluation was required 
if our assumptions about intangible assets change as a result of events or circumstances  and we believe the assets may have declined in value  then we may record impairment charges  resulting in lower profits 
our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of trade names 
we assess the values of these assets apart from goodwill as part of the annual impairment testing 
we use the relief from royalty method to evaluate our trade names  under which the value of a trade name is determined based on a royalty that could be charged to a third party for using the trade name in question 
the royalty  which is based on a reasonable rate applied against forecasted sales  is tax effected and discounted to present value 
the most significant assumptions in this evaluation include estimated future sales  the royalty rate and the after tax discount rate 
for our evaluation purposes  the royalty rates used vary between and of sales and the after tax discount rate of  which we estimate to be our after tax cost of capital 
stock based compensation our employees are periodically granted stock options by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  the compensation cost of all employee stock based compensation awards is measured based on the grant date fair value of those awards and 
table of contents that cost is recorded as compensation expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award generally over the vesting period of the award 
the valuation of stock option awards is complex in that there are a number of variables included in the calculation of the value of a stock option award volatility of our stock price expected term of the option expected dividend yield risk free interest rate over the expected term expected number of options that will not vest we have elected to use a binomial pricing model in the valuation of our stock options because we believe it provides a more accurate measure of the value of employee stock options 
the assumptions used in our valuation of stock options were as follows in  and volatility expected term from vesting date yrs 
yrs 
yrs 
risk free interest rate dividend yield these variables are developed using a combination of our internal data with respect to stock price volatility and exercise behavior of option holders and information from outside sources 
the development of each of these variables requires a significant amount of judgment 
changes in the values of the above variables will result in different option valuations and  therefore  different amounts of compensation cost 
the per share value of options granted in was lower using the assumptions  than had we used the assumptions 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income expectations and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we estimate a deferred tax asset is not likely to be fully realized in the future  a valuation allowance to decrease the amount of the deferred tax asset would decrease net earnings in the period the determination was made 
likewise  if we subsequently determine that we are able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment reducing the valuation allowance would increase net earnings in the period such determination was made 
at december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets relating mainly to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  with a valuation allowance of million 
in  we added a net million of valuation allowances and  accordingly  increased our income tax expense  because we determined that  based on facts and circumstances  the realization of these deferred tax assets was not more likely than not 
for  the most significant increase in our valuation allowance was million related to the uncertainty in realization of the net operating loss and asset tax carryforwards in our mexican utility structures facility due to changes in mexican tax law 
we determined that  based on the new tax law  we would not likely be able to realize the full value of these carryforwards 
accordingly  we established the valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets 
for  we used a portion of net operating loss as well as recorded an increase due to inflation  the net of which was not significant 
if these circumstances change in the future  we may be required to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on these assets  resulting in an increase or decrease in income tax expense and a reduction or increase in net income 

table of contents we are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the various countries in which we operate 
the tax years subject to examination vary by jurisdiction 
we regularly consider the likelihood of additional income tax assessments in each of these taxing jurisdictions based on our experiences related to prior audits and our understanding of the facts and circumstances of the related tax issues 
we include in current income tax expense any changes to accruals for potential tax deficiencies 
if our judgments related to tax deficiencies differ from our actual experience  our income tax expense could increase or decrease in a given fiscal period 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement r sfas no 
r  business combinations 
this statement amends accounting and reporting standards associated with business combinations 
this statement requires the acquiring entity to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquired entity at the date of acquisition at their fair values  including noncontrolling interests 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires that direct costs associated with an acquisition be expensed as incurred and sets forth various other changes in accounting and reporting related to business combinations 
this statement is effective for business combinations completed by us after december  the effect of this statement on our consolidated financial statements is expected to result in lower net income in years when it has acquisitions  since acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and higher values of intangible assets will be recorded in cases where we acquire less than of a company 
in december  the fasb issued statement sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this statement amended the accounting and reporting for noncontrolling interests in a consolidated subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
included in this statement is the requirement that noncontrolling interests be reported in the equity section of the balance sheet 
this statement is effective at the beginning of our fiscal year 
we expect that the effect of this statement on its consolidated financial statements will increase shareholders equity in that minority interest will be classified as part of shareholders equity under this statement
