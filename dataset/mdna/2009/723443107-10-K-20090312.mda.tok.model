item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook general during  we further executed on our growth plan by adding q aircraft at our colgan subsidiary and crj aircraft at our pinnacle subsidiary  with two additional crj aircraft scheduled to deliver in the second quarter of with this phase of our growth plan essentially complete  we intend to focus on controlling costs  maintaining our strong operational reliability  and strengthening our balance sheet 
the regional airline industry is facing a period of slower growth and pressure from major airline partners to reduce costs and potentially reduce some regional airline capacity 
while we do not expect significant adjustments in our fleet size in  we do expect to experience significant cost pressure during this period of low growth 
specifically  we anticipate higher costs in resulting from an expected new collective bargaining agreement with our pilots at pinnacle  higher levels of flight crew staffing at pinnacle  higher health care costs  increased landing fees and facility rental expense at the airports that we serve  and general inflationary pressure within the rest of our cost structure 
in addition  our pro rate operations are susceptible to fuel price volatility and changes in passenger demand 
during the first half of  we experienced an unprecedented increase in the price of fuel within our pro rate operations  and as a result  colgan incurred an operating loss of million during which includes million of non recurring charges related to goodwill impairment and lease return costs 
in response  we implemented a turn around plan during the second half of to improve the results of our pro rate operations 
key components of the plan included eliminating our beech fleet  reducing our saab fleet by six aircraft  eliminating our worst performing markets  rebidding markets that we serve under the federal government s essential air service program eas to increase the subsidies we receive  and renegotiating a connect incentive fee that we receive from united for certain markets that we serve as a united express carrier 
while these steps and the recent decline in fuel prices have reduced the operating losses of our pro rate operations  our pro rate operations are not yet profitable 
additionally  the airline industry is beginning to experience the effects of the current recessionary environment in the united states 
industry revenue and demand dropped during the fourth quarter of  and we are beginning to see trends of lower unit revenue within our pro rate operations 
we cannot predict how severely the recessionary environment will affect us in  but we do expect a significant drop in our unit revenue within our pro rate operations 
further magnifying the cost pressures previously discussed  we will not receive an increase in the rates delta pays us under our crj asa 
the crj asa contains a provision to adjust rates annually based on the change in the producers price index ppi  as published by the united states department of labor  bureau of labor statistics 
our rates could increase by up to annually  but in no case would they decrease 
the ppi declined from december to december  and as a result  our rates will not increase in to offset some of the increased costs and pro rate operations risk that we expect to incur in  we recently announced an internal initiative to create costs savings and additional revenue opportunities of at least million 
we expect to achieve this through a combination of reducing our operating costs  adjusting capacity in our pro rate operations to match the demand environment  identifying new pro rate markets with stronger revenue prospects  potentially reducing the scope of our pro rate operations by retiring additional saab aircraft as necessary  and increasing ancillary third party business such as ground handling 
we have not yet fully identified these initiatives  and there can be no assurance that we will attain our target of at least million in improvements 
we believe it is critical to reduce our costs not only to increase our current profitability  but to also remain competitive long term in the regional airline industry 
the collective bargaining agreement between pinnacle and the air line pilots association alpa  the union representing pinnacle s pilots  has been amendable since april we have met with alpa  both with and without a mediator  many times since april  but we have not reached an agreement for a new contract 
it is of utmost importance to us to reach an agreement with alpa that is consistent with our company wide philosophy of industry average pay and benefits with enhanced employee productivity 
wage rates for pinnacle s pilot group are currently below industry average  and a new collective bargaining agreement is expected to contain an increase in pay for pinnacle s pilots 
such increase could be substantial  and may also include a considerable one time signing bonus 
the increase in pay for pinnacle s pilots will likely reduce our profitability in and in future periods 
in addition  colgan s pilots recently elected representation by alpa 
we have not begun discussions or set a timeline with alpa to commence negotiations of a collective bargaining agreement covering colgan s pilots 
while we intend to vigorously pursue obtaining a fair contract with alpa at both of our operating subsidiaries  the timing of the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued while we expect to be a challenging year  we are positioning ourselves for success in and beyond 
we recently agreed with continental to expand our continental cpa by adding q aircraft from august through april in addition  we acquired an additional q options from the aircraft manufacturer  thereby increasing the total number of our q options to these options  if exercised  provide for the delivery of qs in and the remaining in the q aircraft has become a very competitive product within the regional airline industry 
the purchase price of the q is significantly less than that of comparably sized regional jets  and the q uses up to less fuel 
as a result  we can offer our airline partners a large  passenger friendly regional aircraft with a lower operating cost than similar regional jets 
several of our partners have indicated interest in the q aircraft  and we continue to market our option positions to them 
in addition to growing colgan with the q aircraft  we expect to find other long term opportunities to increase the number of regional jets that we operate at pinnacle 
capacity purchase agreements for over seat regional jet aircraft at our competitors are set to expire between and while many of these regional jets will likely no longer operate within the networks of the major us airlines  we believe some of these contracts will be renewed or offered to other regional airlines and some will be replaced with larger regional jets 
we intend to actively compete to obtain profitable regional jet flying during this period of transition within the industry  and we believe our history of quality performance at a competitive price well positions us to succeed 
our capacity purchase contracts do not begin to expire until december auction rate securities we continue to own approximately million par amount of auction rate securities ars 
due to unprecedented events in the credit markets during  these investments became illiquid and have suffered a decline in fair value 
we reported these investments as noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheet at december  at their estimated fair value of million 
we continue to earn interest on all of our ars  and the majority of our ars are still rated aaa aaa by the credit rating agencies 
most of the banks that structured and sold ars to investors have entered into settlement agreements with various state and federal regulatory authorities that provide for the repurchase of ars at par value from retail investors and small businesses over the next months 
in addition  some banks have made offers to larger institutional investors to repurchase ars at par value in and to the extent that institutional investors have been unable to sell their ars 
we have not yet received such an offer from the financial institution that structured and sold to us our ars  and we have no assurance that we will receive such an offer 
however  we anticipate that to the extent most major banks make settlement offers to their institutional clients  we would be made a similar offer for settlement related to our ars holdings 
the collapse of the ars market has had a significantly negative impact on our liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet 
to partially offset this effect  we arranged for a million margin loan facility the credit facility to be used to support our aircraft purchases and other working capital requirements 
although the credit facility has a maturity date in january  we anticipate that the credit facility will remain outstanding until we receive an offer to repurchase our ars or otherwise monetize our ars portfolio 
while we have effectively obtained the use of million of our ars through this credit facility  we do not have access to the remaining million par amount of our ars to support our liquidity needs 
we do not know when we will be able to monetize our ars portfolio  and we may have no choice but to sell our ars at current distressed prices or to hold our securities until maturity  which could be years or longer 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued million senior convertible notes in addition to actions noted above to improve our operating income longer term  we are focused on conserving cash in in advance of the first date that holders of our million senior convertible notes the notes may contractually require us to repay the notes 
although the notes have a final maturity date in  holders of the notes may tender them to us on february  for a cash payment equal to the par amount 
while we anticipate positive cash flow from our operations during  we do not believe that we will have sufficient cash resources to fully repay this obligation in february without raising additional capital 
we are focused on obtaining the resources we need to settle this obligation without raising capital through a shareholder dilutive action such as an offering of our common stock 
some alternatives we are reviewing include asset financings  such as the financing of our rotable and expendable spare parts inventory  raising additional capital collateralized by ars  or the sale of some or all of our ars 
we repurchased million par amount of the notes for approximately million in january the notes are relatively illiquid  but the few recent trades we have observed have been at prices substantially below par 
we may purchase additional notes during to the extent that notes are offered for sale and to the extent that our resources allow 
colgan flight on february   colgan flight  operated for continental under the company s continental cpa  crashed in a neighborhood near the buffalo niagara international airport in buffalo  new york 
all people aboard  including passengers and four members of the flight crew  died in the accident 
additionally  one individual died inside the home destroyed by the aircraft s impact  increasing the total fatality count to individuals 
one lawsuit related to this accident has been filed against the company  and additional litigation is anticipated 
we carry aviation risk liability insurance and believe that this insurance is sufficient to cover any liability arising from this accident

change change total operating revenue total operating expenses operating income operating margin total nonoperating expense income before income taxes income tax expense net loss income compared to operating revenue operating revenue of million for the year ended december  increased million  or  over the year ended december  this increase was primarily related to an increase in our capacity purchase revenue 
during  we added q aircraft and crj aircraft  including the seven temporary aircraft  to our operating fleet 
this was partially offset by a decrease in the average number of crj aircraft we operate under our crj asa 
our pro rate revenue increased slightly as a result of a increase in average fare  offset by an decrease in passengers 
these changes are discussed in greater detail within our segmented results of operations 
operating expenses operating expenses increased by million  or  during the year ended december   primarily due to increases in block hours and departures associated with the growth in our operating fleet 
in addition  operating expenses increased as a result of increased fuel prices related to our pro rate operations  increased depreciation expense following the addition of our recently purchased crj and q aircraft  increased unreimbursed maintenance costs incurred on our aging crj fleet  impairment charges primarily related to colgan s goodwill  colgan s lease return costs  and increased compensation expense resulting from the addition of employees to support the growth of our business 
these changes are discussed in greater detail within our segmented results of operations 
nonoperating expense net nonoperating expense of million for the year ended december  increased by approximately million over net nonoperating expense of million during this increase is attributable to the million increase in interest expense  primarily related to the financing of the crj and q aircraft  the majority of which were delivered and financed during interest income decreased by million  due to a lower average invested balance throughout as compared to in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge related to the decline in the fair values of our ars portfolio 
net nonoperating expense for the year ended december  was affected by a million loss related to the sale of our remaining northwest unsecured claim 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income tax expense for the year ended december   our income tax expense decreased by million  primarily related to the decrease in pre tax income as compared to partially offsetting the decline of income tax expense is the valuation allowance we recorded against the tax benefit related to the million ars impairment charge 
this valuation allowance was recorded because the loss cannot offset ordinary income  and we expect no capital gains during the carryforward period of this loss 
compared to operating revenues operating revenue of million for the year ended december  decreased million  or  over the year ended december  the decrease in revenue was primarily due to the decrease in revenue associated with expense reimbursements from northwest and a reduction in pinnacle s target operating margin of in to effective january  the most significant decreases in reimbursable expenses were aircraft fuel and aircraft rent 
under the crj asa  jet fuel is provided to pinnacle at no cost  whereas in  jet fuel was a reimbursable expense 
also under the crj asa  our aircraft rental expense has been lowered to a rate that approximated market rates at that time 
these changes to the crj asa caused a decrease of revenue of million 
these decreases are offset by the recognition of deferred crj asa revenue of million

nonoperating expense net nonoperating expense decreased by million  as compared to the same period in the increase was caused by a million increase in interest expense  largely attributable to colgan s operations  offset by million of capitalized interest  primarily related to the acquisition of our q and crj aircraft 
in addition  miscellaneous expense increased by million related to the million loss we recorded on the sale of our million bankruptcy claim against northwest during the second quarter of further offsetting the increase in nonoperating expense is a million increase in interest income from our significantly larger ars portfolio 
the increase in our portfolio relates to the investment of proceeds received from the assignment of our northwest and mesaba claims

during the year ended december   on average we operated fewer crj aircraft as compared to in addition  revenue was negatively affected by a decline in the amount of our reimbursable costs 
pursuant to the terms of our crj asa with delta  we are reimbursed with margin for certain operational costs 
these costs include certain maintenance costs  aircraft rentals  passenger liability and hull insurance  property taxes  fuel  ground handling at crj asa service cities  and landing fees at detroit metropolitan wayne county airport dtw 
to the extent that these reimbursable costs decline  we experience a corresponding decline in revenue 
our reimbursable expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  causing decreases in revenue of 
partially offsetting this decrease is a increase in crj asa revenue for the year ended december  related to the annual inflation index adjustment in our crj block hour and departure asa rates 
revenue earned under our dca was approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   we operated crj aircraft under our dca  seven of which were the temporary aircraft

compared to salaries  wages and benefits increased by million and for the year ended december   as compared to these increases were due primarily to the increase in the average number of employees  coupled with wage rate and benefit increases for existing employees 
the increase in the number of employees is related to our planned increases to support our new dca operations 
additionally  due to a significant decline in pilot attrition in  we experienced an accumulation of additional flight crews above the target level necessary for our operations 
because our agreements with flight crew employees include a guaranteed minimum number of paid hours  we have experienced a decline in pilot and flight attendant productivity as we pay salaries and wages in excess of the actual hours worked such that those employees are paid the guaranteed minimum 
to address the accumulation of excess flight crews  we have suspended our recruiting efforts until attrition allows our staff levels to return to target levels 
also contributing to an increase in salaries  wages and benefits is a million  or  increase in our health insurance costs as a result of an increase in average employee claims 
aircraft rentals expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december  as compared to this decrease from to relates primarily to the fewer average number of crj aircraft  which are leased from delta 
as previously discussed  aircraft rentals are reimbursable expenses under our crj asa  and as a result of the fewer average number of crj aircraft in our fleet  revenue under our crj asa decreased by million for the year ended december  ground handling services decreased million  or  during the year ended december  as compared to ground handling expenses decreased by million  or  due to the decrease in crj departures 
offsetting this decrease is a million increase in deicing expense primarily related to severe weather during under our crj asa  deicing expenses are reimbursable costs  and as such  increased our crj asa revenue by million for the year ended december  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expenses decreased by million and for the year ended december  as compared to underlying this small change are more significant changes in the mix of reimbursed and unreimbursed maintenance costs on the crj aircraft 
to the extent that we experience an increase in unreimbursed maintenance costs  we receive no additional revenue to offset the increases 
for the year ended december   reimbursable maintenance expenses decreased by million  whereas non reimbursable maintenance expenses increased by million 
the million reduction in reimbursed expenses results in a corresponding million decline in our crj asa revenue as we also earn margin on the expenses 
these non reimbursable increases are attributable to additional maintenance related to the aging of our crj fleet 
other rentals and landing fees increased million  or  during the year ended december  as compared to these increases primarily relate to rate increases for landing fees in certain markets  the most significant increase being at dtw  which increased million 
pursuant to the terms of our crj asa with delta  dtw landings fees are reimbursable under our crj asa  and thus caused increases of million in revenue under our crj asa for the year ended december  the additional increase is related to landing fees associated with our dca operations 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million for the year ended december  this is primarily related to million of depreciation on crj aircraft added during other expense increased by million  or  for the year ended december  this increase primarily relates to increased pilot training and crew travel expenses related to our new operations with delta 
provision for decreases in losses associated with bankruptcy filings of northwest and mesaba  which was an offset to operating expenses in  decreased by million 
in  mesaba filed for bankruptcy and subsequently rejected lease agreements for saab turboprop aircraft that were previously subleased from pinnacle 
as a result  we recorded sublease losses during and related to these aircraft 
during  we placed two of these saab aircraft into service with colgan and recorded a recovery of million as we operated the aircraft 
compared to salaries  wages and benefits increased by million  or  primarily due to the increase in the average number of employees  coupled with wage and benefit increases 
aircraft rental expense decreased million  or  primarily due to the terms of the crj asa with delta 
effective january   our monthly lease rates were reduced to rates that approximated market conditions at that time 
as previously noted  we sublease our crj aircraft from delta under operating leases that expire december  delta reimburses in full all rental expense for the crj aircraft operated under the crj asa 
ground handling services decreased by million  or  due to the increase in the number of cities in which ground handling functions are performed by pinnacle s employees rather than being outsourced 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expenses increased by approximately million and 
pinnacle incurred an additional million of heavy check expense during  which is related to the aging of its fleet 
the additional maintenance expense was also attributed to the increase in pinnacle s operating fleet 
aircraft fuel expense decreased by million primarily due to the contractual change in the crj asa whereby fuel is now provided at no cost 
commissions and passenger related expense increased million and primarily related to the increase in block hours and departures

landing fees associated with our q operations are reimbursed directly by continental  therefore  an offsetting amount is included in revenue 
aircraft fuel expense increased million  or  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily related to the year over year increase in the average price per gallon of fuel 
offsetting this increase in fuel price was a decrease in gallons consumed for the year ended december  as a result of a decrease in our pro rate block hours due to the retirement of of our saab and beech aircraft 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million for the year ended december  this is primarily related to million of depreciation expense related to the new q aircraft

on february   we entered into a purchase agreement for up to firm and option q aircraft with bombardier  inc under the agreement  we are obligated to purchase a minimum of q regional aircraft  which we satisfied during in january  we modified the purchase agreement to exercise our right to purchase the remaining ten firm q aircraft and five option q aircraft  which will be delivered between august and april we also secured additional options to acquire q option aircraft that would be delivered in upon completion of this amendment  we now have optional rights to acquire a total of q aircraft  of which would deliver in and of which would deliver in we are required to make pre delivery payments to bombardier for the firm q aircraft that we have on order  which will be made from january to october of the remaining pre delivery payments to be made in and  approximately will be financed with export development canada edc and the remaining will be funded by our internal capital resources 
the unfinanced portion of our pre delivery payment requirements  which is approximately million  is not scheduled to be paid until the second quarter of for more information  refer to risk factors in item a and note of item of this form k 
on april   delta assigned to us its rights to purchase crj aircraft from bombardier  inc as of december  we had accepted delivery of of these aircraft 
we will take delivery of the remaining two aircraft in the second quarter of under the dca  delta may also require us to purchase and operate an additional seven crj aircraft 
during  we executed pre delivery payment financing facilities with edc to provide borrowings to fund our pre delivery payment commitments to bombardier related to our purchase of crj aircraft and our first q aircraft 
borrowings under the pre delivery payment facilities bear interest at the month libor rate plus  which was as of december  the outstanding balance of these borrowings as of december  was million 
as each aircraft is delivered to us  we repay the associated borrowings 
upon delivery of our crj and q aircraft  we obtained long term financing for of the aircraft purchase price  the balance of which was million at december  we expect to finance the purchase of the remaining two crj aircraft and the additional q aircraft using a combination of internal capital resources and debt financing  or through operating leases to the extent operating leases are available to us at competitive rates 
we have obtained commitments from edc to finance of the purchase price of the remaining aircraft on order for a term of years from the delivery date of each aircraft 
in addition to utilizing edc s offer for debt financing  we expect to seek operating lease financing for some of our remaining q deliveries to reduce the amount of initial capital required to obtain the aircraft and because we do not need all of the accelerated tax depreciation benefits associated with owning these aircraft 
we maintain a revolving line of credit with an institutional lender for a principal amount not to exceed million or of the net unpaid balance of our colgan subsidiary s eligible accounts receivable 
this instrument has an interest rate of prime plus  which was as of december  in april  we extended the termination date of the loan to april  amounts outstanding under the line of credit were million at december  during the first quarter of  the company repaid approximately million which reduced the remaining outstanding credit facility to approximately million 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the irs is currently examining our tax records for years through the irs has proposed adjustments related to certain key transactions that we undertook during those periods 
the adjustments would increase our tax liability for these periods by approximately million net of offsetting timing differences within these periods plus penalties 
we are negotiating and discussing the proposed adjustments with an appeals team from the irs  and we expect to resolve these matters during the first half of we continue to believe that the tax positions we have taken are appropriate and in compliance with tax law and regulations 
although we believe our tax positions are appropriate  we have recorded reserves totaling million 
the company is still in resolution negotiations with the irs and cannot predict the ultimate outcome  however  management believes that any settlement reached will not exceed our reserves 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  this was due primarily to cash generated from regional airline service operations of million  offset by million in hedge related payments 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  this was due primarily to the million increase in deferred revenue  which was primarily comprised of the approximately million of proceeds received from the assignment of our northwest claims  offset by the elimination of our pre petition receivables balance of approximately million 
on january   we assigned an aggregate of approximately million of our million stipulated unsecured claim against northwest to several third parties for aggregate proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses 
we received the proceeds from this sale on january  on june  we assigned the remaining million of our claim for proceeds of million 
the sale of our claim is subject to federal and state income taxation  and through december   we made estimated tax payments of approximately million related to the claim sale 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december   due primarily to cash generated from net income of million  which included million as a noncash provision for decreases in losses associated with the bankruptcy filings of northwest and mesaba  and million in deferred income tax expense  offset by a million decrease in receivables related to the timing of the previously mentioned payment from northwest and other miscellaneous charges 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
this was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the sale of investments in ars of million  offset by million in net cash purchases of property and equipment  primarily consisting of our equity investment in aircraft and related flight equipment 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
this was primarily attributable to net purchases of short term investments in marketable debt securities of million  million in pre delivery payments for the q and crj aircraft and purchases of property and equipment of million  primarily consisting of aircraft purchases 
in addition  the acquisition of colgan decreased cash by million  net of cash acquired

we expect to fund the non aircraft capital expenditures with existing cash resources and cash flows generated from our operations 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
during the year ended december   we received million in debt proceeds  primarily related to the million credit facility 
this was offset by million of principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations  primarily related to our aircraft financing  million purchase of our series a preferred share from northwest on january   and million for debt issuance costs related to our new borrowings 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
during  we received million in debt proceeds  primarily related to the pre delivery payment financing facilities for our q and crj aircraft 
this was offset by million of principal payments on debt obligations and million of payments made on capital leases 
in addition  we purchased million of treasury shares as part of our share repurchase program 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  which related to the repayment of a line of credit with a bank 
that line of credit expired in june deferred tax asset 
we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of million related to future tax benefits 
this primarily relates to the timing difference of tax payments associated with our deferred crj asa revenue  offset by book tax timing differences related to aircraft depreciation 
as discussed in note in item of this form k  we are recognizing the deferred crj asa revenue over the year term of the crj asa  while we recognized this as taxable income and paid the associated tax during guarantees and indemnifications 
we had million and million invested in certificates of deposit and in other similar instruments at december  and  respectively 
these certificates of deposit have various maturities  all less than one year and are used as collateral for standby letter of credit facilities that we maintain for various vendors 
as of december  and  we had million and million of standby letters of credit outstanding  respectively 
we are party to numerous contracts and real estate leases in which it is common for us to agree to indemnify third parties for tort liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the contract or occupancy of the leased premises 
in some cases  this indemnity extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties  but usually excludes any liabilities caused by their gross negligence or willful misconduct 
additionally  we typically indemnify the lessors and related third parties for any environmental liability that arises out of or relates to our leased premises 
in our aircraft lease agreements  we typically indemnify the prime lessor  financing parties  trustees acting on their behalf and other related parties against liabilities that arise from the manufacture  design  ownership  financing  use  operation and maintenance of the aircraft and for tort liability  whether or not these liabilities arise out of or relate to the negligence of these indemnified parties  except for their gross negligence or willful misconduct 
we expect that we would be covered by insurance subject to deductibles for most tort liabilities and related indemnities described above with respect to real estate we lease and aircraft we operate 
we do not expect the potential amount of future payments under the foregoing indemnities and agreements to be material 
off balance sheet arrangements 
none of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
we are responsible for all maintenance  insurance and other costs associated with these leased assets  however  the lease agreements do not include a residual value guarantee  fixed price purchase option or other similar guarantees 
we have no other material off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued significant accounting policies and critical estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the sec has defined critical accounting policies as those policies that are most important to the preparation of financial statements and require management s subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
see also note in item of this form k for a discussion of new and proposed accounting standards 
revenue recognition nature of estimates required we recognize revenue as services are provided based on the rates and provisions of the underlying code share agreements with our partners 
our operating agreements include the ability to earn incentive revenue 
the calculation of these revenues involves the use of estimates that can be subject to differing analysis of the relating operating metrics or interpretation of the related contractual provisions 
in some instances  uncertainty exists as to the party responsible for causing a negative effect on the relevant operating metric 
our code share partners may dispute the amount billed and pay less than the amount invoiced if its interpretation of the agreement is different from ours 
assumptions and approach used our operating revenues are calculated based on our interpretation of the underlying code share agreements and our analysis of the related operating metrics 
effect if different assumptions used while in practice these kinds of discrepancies are quickly resolved with our partners typically within the following month  should our interpretation of the agreement or analysis of the relevant operating metrics differ materially from those of our code share partners and our interpretations fail to prevail  our revenue could be materially understated or overstated 
for example  during the second quarter of we estimated our operating performance under the crj asa to have resulted in lost incentive revenue of approximately million for the first six months of compared to northwest s assertion that the forgone incentive revenue was million 
subsequent to a detailed analysis of the facts underlying the cause of the operating performance  we ultimately settled the issue within two months for approximately million 
income tax reserves nature of estimates required on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this interpretation establishes new standards for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
under fin  we recognize tax benefits only for income tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin was immaterial to our financial statements 
we classify interest related to income tax liabilities as interest expense  and if applicable  penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense 
these income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties are presented as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to our federal tax return  we file numerous state income tax returns 
we are no longer subject to us federal income tax examination for years through except for specific us federal income tax positions that are in various stages of appeal  as discussed below 
assumptions and approach used our income tax reserves are based on management s assessment of an issue s expected resolution  based on several factors  including tax audits  appeals  litigation  changes in tax laws and other rules and the history of how the issue has been treated by other airlines 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued effect if different assumptions used it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for tax positions under fin changes may result from the conclusion of ongoing audits or appeals in state  local  and federal tax jurisdictions 
our liability for tax positions under fin includes one matter that is individually material 
specifically  we are currently under audit by the internal revenue service irs for the tax years through in may  the irs proposed certain adjustments to our positions related to various exam matters 
should the irs prevail on these adjustments  the impact could be significant 
we are currently reviewing these matters with an administrative appeals team from the irs  and expect to reach resolution on the disputed tax exam items during the first half of we believe the potential tax exposure related to the items the irs has focused on during its examinations would not exceed million  of which we have reserved million 
should the irs prevail in obtaining the additional amount  future earnings could be reduced by up to approximately million 
although we believe our tax positions are appropriate  the company is still in resolution negotiations with the irs and cannot predict the ultimate outcome  however  management believes that any settlement reached will not exceed our reserves 
fair value of auction rate securities nature of estimates required we have million par value of investments related to auction rate securities  all of which are classified as noncurrent assets at december  as described in note of item of this form k  we have categorized the fair value for these assets as level under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
level financial instruments are those with little to no observable inputs about which there is little or no market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions to use in the determination of fair value 
assumptions and approach used for each of our ars  we prepared a discounted cash flow dcf analysis to determine the estimated fair value as of december  the assumptions used in preparing the dcf model include estimates for the amount and timing of future interest and principal payments and the rate of return required by investors to own these securities in the current environment 
in making these assumptions  we considered relevant factors including the likely timing of principal repayments  the probability of full repayment considering the guarantees by the us department of education of the underlying student loans and guarantees by other third parties  the formula specific to each security which defines the applicable earnings rate paid in the event of a failed auction the max rate  forward projections of the future max rates for each security  and our estimate of the rate of return required by investors to own these securities 
based on the results of this assessment and to the extent that we believe any estimated decline in the fair value is temporary in nature coupled with our ability and intent to hold the investment until its value recovers  we record a temporary impairment charge in accumulated other comprehensive income 
conversely  to the extent that we believe the charge to be either permanent in nature or to persist for as long as we may hold the investment  we must record the other than temporary impairment charge in nonoperating expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
accordingly  during we recorded an impairment charge in nonoperating expense of million to reduce the carrying value of our ars to their estimated fair values 
effect if different assumptions used while we believe the decline in the fair values of our ars to be entirely related to their present illiquidity  we included in earnings the million impairment charge because we may not hold the securities until their values recover for reasons previously explained within our discussion of liquidity and capital resources 
had we determined that we had both the ability and intent to hold the securities until their values recovered  all or a majority of the impairment would have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of equity 
additionally  had any of our dcf assumptions differed  particularly with respect to the expected duration of the investments and the discount rate used to value the securities  the recorded impairment could have materially increased or decreased 
for example  while our dcf assumes an average holding period of approximately nine years  had we used an average holding period of eight years  the estimated impairment would have decreased by approximately million 
conversely  had we used an average duration of ten years  the estimated impairment would have increased by approximately million 
similarly  if we were to decrease or increase by the discount rate used to value the investments  the estimated impairment would have decreased by million or increased by million  respectively 
further  were the credit rating of either the security issuer or the third party insurer underlying the investments to further deteriorate  we may be required to record additional impairment charges  either through earnings or equity  to adjust the carrying value of our ars 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued goodwill and other long lived assets goodwill nature of estimates required our long lived assets consist of goodwill and intangible assets  as well as property and equipment 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  intangible assets can have either finite or indefinite useful lives 
under sfas  we perform an impairment evaluation for each reporting unit  which are composed of our pinnacle and colgan segments 
we perform an impairment test to the net book value of goodwill on an annual basis and  if certain events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss may have been incurred  on an interim basis 
the scheduled annual impairment test date for our goodwill is october factors considered important when determining the impairment of goodwill under sfas include items affecting the cash flows of the reporting segments  significant changes in the underlying business strategy or operational environment  material ongoing industry or economic trends  or other factors specific to the asset or reporting segments being evaluated 
any changes in the key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities could result in an impairment charge 
at june   because of impairment indicators existing during the second quarter  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test of goodwill at our colgan reporting unit 
factors we deemed to be collectively an indicator that a goodwill impairment test was required for colgan included record high fuel prices  continued operating losses  a softening us economy  and the planned removal of ten saab aircraft from colgan s pro rate operating fleet during based on the results of our evaluation  we determined that colgan s goodwill was fully impaired and recorded a million impairment charge at june  for a discussion of colgan s goodwill impairment  see note in item of this form k 
at october   we performed the annual required impairment test of our pinnacle reporting unit goodwill  which resulted in no impairment charge 
additionally  at december   because the company s book value exceeded its market capitalization  we performed an interim impairment test of pinnacle s goodwill 
the interim impairment analysis also resulted in no impairment charge 
assumptions and approach used our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
our determination of a reporting unit s fair value is based upon our perspective of industry trends  market rates and market transactions 
other assumptions include the appropriate discount rate  which represents our weighted average cost of capital 
factors indicating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived assets  a significant change in the condition of the long lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived assets 
during  particularly during the fourth quarter  the airline sector and the broader securities markets generally were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity 
our stock price  consistent with stock prices in the broader airline sector  declined significantly during this period of time 
during the fourth quarter of  our market capitalization fell below recorded book value 
with respect to the testing of our goodwill for impairment  we believe that it is reasonable to consider market capitalization as an indicator of fair value over a reasonable period of time 
if the current economic market conditions persist and if there is a prolonged period of weakness in the business environment and airline sector  our businesses may be adversely affected  which could result in future impairment of pinnacle s goodwill 
effect if different assumptions used if the results of these evaluations determined that impairment has occurred  an impairment charge could affect earnings by as much as the carrying value 
as of december   we had approximately million in goodwill 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued long lived assets nature of estimates required approximately of our total assets are invested in property and equipment  which will continue to increase as we acquire additional aircraft to support our capacity purchase agreements with delta and continental 
we capitalize only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards 
accordingly  repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset or are not part of the cost of acquiring the asset are expensed as incurred 
the depreciation of our property and equipment over their estimated useful lives and the determination of any salvage values requires management to make judgments about future events 
assumptions and approach used in accounting for long lived assets including intangible assets with definite lives  we must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
because we utilize most of our property and equipment over relatively long periods  we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset 
in addition to considering our planned use of long lived assets  when necessary  such as when making estimates related to our new aircraft for which there is little historical data available  we engage airline industry specialists to assist with the determination of relevant estimates 
when appropriate  we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset s  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and cash flows associated with the use of the long lived asset 
the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value 
when considering whether or not impairment of long lived assets exists  we group similar assets together at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and compare the undiscounted cash flows for the entire group of assets to the carrying value of the same group of assets 
asset groupings are typically done at the fleet or contract level 
we have not experienced any significant impairment of assets to be held and used 
however  from time to time we make decisions to remove certain long lived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs  and those decisions may result in an impairment charge 
there were no material asset impairment charges recognized in  or effect if different assumptions used periodic re evaluations  which can be significant  could be caused by changes to our maintenance program  changes in the utilization of the aircraft  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used similar aircraft 
generally  these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense  as required by accounting standards and  ultimately  the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
any impairment charge could affect earnings by as much as the carrying values of the assets 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued spare parts and supplies nature of estimates required inventories  expendable parts and maintenance supplies relating to flight equipment are carried at cost and are expensed when the inventory is used 
a fleet retirement reserve is provided over the remaining estimated useful life of the related aircraft equipment  for spare parts expected to be on hand at the date the aircraft are retired from service  plus allowances for spare parts currently identified as obsolete or excess 
we will continue to modify these estimates as our fleet ages 
the adequacy of our fleet retirement reserve requires a high degree of judgment 
assumptions and approach used our fleet retirement reserve related to inventory is provided over the remaining useful life of the related aircraft  plus allowance for spare parts currently identified as excess 
part of the calculation for this reserve is based on historical experience 
in addition  we may reserve for additional amounts when we deem parts as excess inventory 
effect if different assumptions used as of december   our fleet retirement reserve related to our spare parts and supplies was approximately million 
if we increase the reserve by  the impact on pre tax income is immaterial 
in addition to the estimates discussed above  we have made certain other estimates that  while not involving the same degree of judgment  are important to understanding our financial statements 
we continually evaluate our accounting policies and the estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
our estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment after giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
management has discussed the development of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented above relating to them

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk because the majority of our contracts are capacity purchase agreements  our exposure to market risks such as commodity price risk eg  aircraft fuel prices is primarily limited to our pro rate operations  which comprise of our consolidated revenues 
with our acquisition of colgan and our contracts with delta and continental that include the purchase of aircraft  we are exposed to commodity price and interest rate risks as discussed below 
commodity price risk our pro rate operations include exposure to certain market risks primarily related to aircraft fuel  which has been extremely volatile 
aviation fuel expense is a significant expense for any air carrier  and even marginal changes in the cost of fuel greatly affect a carrier s profitability 
standard industry contracts do not generally provide protection against fuel price increases  nor do they ensure availability of supply 
while our capacity purchase agreements require that fuel be provided to us at no cost  thereby reducing our overall exposure to fuel price fluctuations  the company s pro rate code share agreements with continental  us airways  and united expose the company to fuel price risk 
slightly offsetting our fuel risk  our agreement with continental provides for an adjustment to the pro rate revenue we receive from continental based on projected changes in fuel prices 
for the projected annualized fuel consumption related to these agreements  each ten percent change in the price of jet fuel amounts to an approximate million change in annual fuel costs 
interest rate risk aircraft financing 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk from the time of entering into purchase commitments until the delivery of aircraft  at which time the company receives permanent  fixed rate financing for each aircraft 
as of december   the company had accepted delivery of of its crj aircraft with the remaining two set to deliver in the second quarter of in january  the company entered in a purchase agreement for firm q aircraft with bombardier  which will be delivered between august and april should interest rates changes by basis points before we take delivery  and assuming that we do not hedge the anticipated debt on the remaining crj and q aircraft  aggregate interest expense in the first year of financing would change by approximately million 
investment income 
our earnings are affected by fluctuations in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on the amount of interest income we earn from our investments  which primarily consists of ars 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments to protect against the effects of changes in interest rates on our interest income 
based on our current balance of ars  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in annual investment income of approximately million 
see note in item of this form k for additional information about ars 
senior convertible notes 
while we pay interest on the notes at a fixed rate of  the fair value of the notes is sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes in the market price of our common stock 
interest rate changes may result in increases or decreases in the fair value of the notes due to differences between market interest rates and rates in effect at the inception of the obligation 
the fair value of the notes may also increase or decrease with differences between the current market price of our common stock and the market price on the original issuance date of the notes 
unless we elect to repurchase additional notes in the open market  changes in their fair value have no impact on our consolidated financial statements as a whole 
the estimated fair value of the notes on march  was approximately million  based on quoted market prices
