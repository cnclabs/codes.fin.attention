item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company has two reportable segments  visiting nurse vn and personal care pc 
reportable segments have been identified based upon how management has organized the business by services provided to customers and the criteria in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our vn segment provides skilled medical services in patients homes largely to enable recipients to reduce or avoid periods of hospitalization and or nursing home care 
vn medicare revenues are generated on a per episode basis rather than a fee per visit or an hourly basis 
of the vn segment revenues are generated from the medicare program while the balance is generated from medicaid and private insurance programs 
our pc segment services are also provided in patients homes 
these services generally provided by paraprofessional staff such as home health aides are generally of a custodial rather than skilled nature 
pc revenues are typically generated on an hourly basis 
of the pc segment revenues are generated from medicaid and other government programs while the balance is generated from insurance programs and private pay patients 
our view on reimbursement and diversification of risk our company is highly dependent on government reimbursement programs which pay for the majority of the services we provide to our patients 
reimbursement under these programs  primarily medicare and medicaid  is subject to frequent changes as policy makers balance their own needs to meet the health care needs of constituents while also meeting their fiscal objectives 
we believe that an important key to our historical success and to our future success is our ability to adapt our operations to meet changes in reimbursement as they occur 
one important way in which we have achieved this adaptability in the past  and in which we plan to achieve it in the future  is to maintain some level of diversification in our business mix 
the execution of our business plan emphasizes our vn operations 
our pc operations will help us maintain a level of diversification of reimbursement risk that we believe is appropriate 
our business plan our future success depends on our ability to execute our business plan 
over the next three to five years we will try to accomplish the following generate meaningful same store sales growth through the focused provision of high quality services and attending to the needs of our patients  expand the significance of our visiting nurse  medicare based  home health services by selectively acquiring other quality providers and through the startup of new agencies  and expand our capital base through both earnings performance and by seeking additional capital investments in our company 
president s proposed budget for federal fiscal year on thursday february  president obama released his proposed budget outline for the federal fiscal year 
although details have not yet been released  the proposed budget appears to call for a reduction in reimbursement rates for medicare home health services beginning january  additionally  although it is less clear  the proposed budget may also be calling for an additional reduction in reimbursement rates for medicare home health services beginning january  the budget is currently in proposed form and congress has yet to take any action on the proposal 
there can be no assurance that the budget will or will not be passed into law 
accordingly  the company is unable to predict what impact the ultimate federal budget might have on our financial condition  our results of operations or the realizability of the carrying amount of our assets  in particular intangible assets including goodwill 
we may be unable to take actions to mitigate any of whatever negative reimbursement changes might ultimately be enacted 
the reimbursement change ultimately enacted could have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity  results of operations and financial position 
it is reasonable to expect that the proposed budget changes  if enacted  might have a more immediate and negative impact on those providers generating lower margins than us  with more leverage relative to earnings than us  with less capital resources than us  or with less ability to adapt their operations 
the president s proposed budget for appears to align with the report of the medicare payment advisory commission medpac 
medpac suggests  in connection with its recommendation for a rebasing or recalculation of home health reimbursement rates for that such change would likely result in some agencies exiting medicare 
based on this and our own interpretation of the potential implications of the president s proposed budget we believe that the proposal  if enacted  would likely result in a significant contraction of the number of home health providers 
in the event of such a contraction in the number of providers  we believe the surviving providers would likely benefit from a higher rate of admissions growth than would have otherwise occurred 
those providers who wind up serving the dislocated patients previously served by the exiting providers could reasonably expect to earn incremental margins on those patients that may serve to offset a portion of the rate reduction from the medicare program 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting such dislocated patients 
at this point  we are unable to predict what actions congress may take in passing the budget for the potential budget for  which would actually be passed some time during is even less predictable 
we can provide you with no assurance that the ultimate budget and resulting medicare reimbursement rates will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  our results of operation  the realizability of the carrying amounts of our intangible assets including goodwill or our financial condition 
we are currently formulating actions intended to mitigate or otherwise offset some of the negative effects of the proposed reimbursement changes 
these actions may include any or all of the following increasing our revenues by investing more resources in sales and marketing activities to drive admission growth  establishing startup branch operations to expand our service territories  and acquisitions of underperforming providers with strong referral relationships  reducing our costs by developing a more efficient delivery model  increasing the productivity standards for our staff  limiting or eliminating the growth in wage rates  limiting or reducing the size of our work force  closing unprofitable branch operations and accelerating our efforts to evaluate the use of technology  potentially other actions we deem appropriate 
although we will attempt to mitigate or otherwise offset the negative effect of reimbursement changes  there can be no assurance that our actions will ultimately prove successful 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  we select the principle or method that is appropriate in the specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  collectibility of accounts receivable  insurance reserves  litigation  goodwill  intangibles and contingencies on an on going basis 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are appropriate under the circumstances 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements 
receivables and revenue recognition we recognize revenues when patient services are provided 
our receivables and revenues are stated at amounts estimated by us to be their net realizable values 
the company is paid for its services primarily by federal and state third party reimbursement programs  commercial insurance companies  and patients 
revenues are recorded at established rates in the period during which the services are rendered 
appropriate allowances to give recognition to third party payment arrangements are recorded when the services are rendered 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
it is common for issues to arise related to medical coding  particularly with respect to medicare  patient eligibility  particularly related to medicaid  and other reasons unrelated to credit risk  all of which may result in adjustments to recorded revenue amounts 
management continuously evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments and when appropriate provides allowances for losses based upon the best available information 
there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change by material amounts in the near term 
we report accounts receivable net of estimated allowances for doubtful accounts and adjustments 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on certain factors  such as payor types  historical collection trends and aging categories 
we calculate our reserve for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
the percentage applied to the receivable balances in the various aging categories is based on historical collection experience  business and economic conditions and reimbursement trends 
medicare reimbursement  on an episodic basis  is subject to adjustment if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
our revenue recognition under the medicare reimbursement program is based on certain variables including  but not limited  to i changes in the base episode payments established by the medicare program  ii adjustments to the base episode payments for partial episodes and for other factors  such as case mix  geographic wages  low utilization and intervening events  and  iii recoveries of overpayments 
adjustments to revenue result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we recognize medicare revenue on an episode by episode basis during the course of each episode over its expected number of visits 
insurance programs we bear significant insurance risk under our large deductible workers compensation insurance program and our self insured employee health program 
under the workers compensation insurance program  we bear risk up to  per incident 
we purchase stop loss insurance for the employee health plan that places a specific limit  generally  on our exposure for any individual covered life 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we are aware of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we currently carry professional and general liability insurance coverage for this exposure with no deductible 
we record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we monitor our estimated insurance related liabilities on a monthly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets are stated at fair value at time of acquisition and goodwill represents the excess cost over the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets are not amortized 
we perform impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment analysis requires numerous subjective assumptions and estimates to determine fair value of the respective reporting units as required by sfas no 
we estimate the fair value of the related reporting units using both a discounted cash flow model and a comparison to other publicly traded companies in the home healthcare industry 
these models are based on our projections of future revenues and operating costs and are reconciled to our consolidated market capitalization 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital as well as the weighted average cost of capital of other market participants 
as of december   we completed our impairment review and determined that no impairment charge was required 
future medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates  admissions  volumes  our liquidity and other factors may have a significant impact on our business and required the recognition of impairment charges in the future 
accounting for income taxes as of december   we have net deferred tax assets of approximately  the net deferred tax asset is composed of approximately  of current deferred tax assets  approximately  of non current tax assets and approximately  of long term deferred tax liabilities 
we have provided a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets based upon our estimation of realizability of those assets through future taxable income 
this valuation allowance was based in large part on our history of generating operating income or losses in individual tax locales and expectations for the future 
our ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  competitive pressures on revenues and margins and legislation and regulation at all levels of government 
we have considered the above factors in reaching our conclusion that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets net of the valuation allowance as of december  however  there can be no assurances that we will meet our expectations of future taxable income 
seasonality our visiting nurse segment operations located in florida normally experience higher admissions during the first quarter and lower admissions during the third quarter than in the other quarters due to seasonal population fluctuations

income from continuing operations for was approximately million or per diluted share compared to approximately million or per diluted share in on more shares outstanding 
interest expense is higher due to increased usage of the revolving line of credit for acquisitions in the increase was partially offset by lower interest rates 
our effective interest rate on our bank credit facility was in and in the effective tax rate was approximately for the year ended december  and in see page for discussion of ebitda 
visiting nurse segment year ended december  and approximately of the vn segment revenues were generated from the medicare program while the balance is generated from medicaid and private insurance programs 
in addition to our focus on operating income from the visiting nurse segment  we also measure this segment s performance in terms of admissions  patient months of care  revenue per patient month and cost of services per patient month

the million increase came from a combination of organic growth of million and acquired operations of million 
vn organic revenue growth rate was for the patient care acquisition  completed august   contributed million in revenue for the year 
revenue per completed episode increased about over due to an increase in the acuity level and changes in the geographic mix of the patients we served 
the increase in the acuity level of patients served is also reflected in the increase in the average number of visits per episode 
gross margin decreased from in to in due to the effect of flat medicare reimbursement rates and continuing increases in direct care wages and mileage reimbursement 
our general and administrative salaries and benefits increased predominantly as a result of the increase in the average number of locations in operation between periods both de novo and acquisition  increases in wage rates and the addition of segment management staff driven by our focus on the execution of our strategic plan to develop the visiting nurse segment 
however  total general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue declined from to approximately as additional volumes and branches spread general and administrative expenses over a larger revenue base

volumes increased on admission growth combined with increased utilization of services per patient and a small price increase 
a small price increase resulting from changes in the mix of business as well as rate increases from certain state medicaid programs is also reflected in the increase in gross margin percent 
general and administrative salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue decreased due to the increase in volumes partially offset by increased workers compensation expenses 
other general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense

vn revenue growth was driven by acquisitions  admissions growth  and start up operations 
acquired vn operations contributed approximately million of revenue in the remaining revenue growth came from locations in operation in both periods which in the aggregate grew approximately over revenue generated in pc operating income decreased due to lower gross margins 
interest expense is significantly higher due to increased usage of the revolving line of credit for acquisitions in corporate expenses increased due to increased incentive provisions  executive compensation  and increased recruiting efforts 
in the year ended december  the company incurred approximately  of incremental corporate expense to comply with internal control reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act

this demonstrates both growth through acquisition and improvement of existing markets 
quality of life generated million of revenue in in newly acquired markets 
gross margin remained constant between periods 
our general and administrative salaries and benefits increased predominantly as a result of the increase in the average number of locations in operation between periods substantially all of which were acquired  increases in wage rates and the addition of segment management staff driven by our focus on the execution of our strategic plan to develop the visiting nurse segment

our volume of business and our business mix was unfavorably impacted by changes in medicaid programs  particularly in ohio  which caused a shift of patients away from traditional programs and toward managed care programs which typically pay lower rates and more stringently limit utilization of services per patient 
general and administrative expenses were relatively unchanged between years 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that a certain amount of debt has an appropriate place in our overall capital structure and it is not our strategy to eliminate all debt financing 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity on our bank credit facility  described below  will be sufficient to cover operating needs  future capital expenditure requirements and scheduled debt payments of miscellaneous small borrowing arrangements and capitalized leases 
in addition  it is likely that we will pursue growth from acquisitions  partnerships and other ventures that would be funded from excess cash from operations  credit available under the bank credit agreement and other financing arrangements that are normally available in the marketplace 
revolving credit facility at december  the company had a million three year senior secured revolving credit facility with jp morgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  fifth third bank  as syndication agent and certain other lenders 
the facility consists of a million credit line with a maturity date of july  and an accordion feature providing for potential future expansion of the facility to million 
this credit facility replaced the company s previous million credit facility with jp morgan chase bank  na 
borrowings other than letters of credit under the credit facility generally bear interest at a rate varying from libor plus to libor plus  depending on leverage 
borrowings under the agreement are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in all tangible and intangible assets of the company  and all existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries of the company as guarantors 
at december   the company s borrowings were currently prime rate based 
the weighted average interest rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company pays a commitment fee of per annum on the unused facility balance 
borrowings are available equal to a multiple of times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
ebitda may include acquired ebitda from proforma acquisitions pursuant to a calculation rider  up to of adjusted ebitda  as defined 
borrowings under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
as of december   the formula permitted all million to be used  of which million was outstanding 
the company has irrevocable letters of credit  totaling million outstanding in connection with its self insurance programs 
thus  a total of million was available for use at december  the company s revolving credit facility is subject to various financial covenants 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the covenants 
under the most restrictive of its covenants  the company is required to maintain minimum net worth of at least million 
the company believes that this facility will be sufficient to fund its operating needs for at least the next year 
the company will continue to evaluate additional capital  including possible debt and equity investments in the company  to support a more rapid development of the business than would be possible with internal funds 
cash flows key elements to the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december   and were as follows net change in cash and cash equivalents provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities discontinued operations activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents compared to net cash provided by operating activities resulted principally from current period income of million  net of changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts receivable days revenues outstanding were at december  and at december  primarily due to a longer average length of stay in the vn segment as a result of higher acuity patients that we serve 
cash flows from operating activities were reduced by a million increase in accounts receivable 
the four day increase in days revenue outstanding accounted for approximately million while the balance of million resulted from organic revenue growth 
the increase in accounts payable and prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to our increased volume of business 
the cash used in investing activities is primarily due to the apex home healthcare acquisition million completed in march and the patient care acquisition million in august net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the million stock offering in april and million of additional borrowings on our credit facility 
compared to net cash provided by operating activities resulted principally from current period income  net of changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts receivable days revenue outstanding were at december  and at december  the cash used in investing activities is primarily due to acquisitions completed in and capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from stock option exercises  net repayments of the revolving credit facility and the payment of notes payable from acquisitions in and the company s stock option plans permit optionees to have option shares withheld on exercises in lieu of taxes which is shown in the cash flow statement as a repurchase of shares in the amount of million 
the company receives a current tax deduction for compensation expense subject to irs limits 
such deductions related to stock option exercises in the march quarter  are shown in the cash flow statement as a cash inflow of approximately stock offering on april   the company filed a prospectus supplement whereby  shares of common stock were offered for sale at a price of per share 
in the second quarter  the company sold  shares in a public offering for net proceeds of million after deducting the underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
in conjunction with the stock offering  the company retired all of its outstanding treasury stock 
in december  the company filed a million shelf registration statement with the availability for the issuance of any combination of common stock  preferred stock  warrants and debt securities 
the registration statement became effective december   and the company has not yet issued any securities using the registration statement medicare reimbursement in october the centers for medicare medicaid services cms published regulations specifying medicare home health reimbursement rates for medicare rates for include a market basket rate increase update of less a case mix creep adjustment 
accordingly  medicare rates are not materially different from rates 
medicaid reimbursement we have a significant dependence on state medicaid reimbursement programs 
for the year ended december   approximately       and of our revenues were generated from medicaid reimbursement programs in the states of connecticut  ohio  kentucky  massachusetts  florida  indiana  new jersey and alabama  respectively 
acquisitions the company has completed several acquisitions over the past three fiscal years and will continue to actively seek to acquire other quality providers of medicare certified home health services like our current visiting nurse segment operations 
we may consider acquisitions of businesses that provide health care services similar to those we currently offer in our personal care segment but we expect most of our acquisition activity to be focused on visiting nurse operations 
factors which may affect future acquisition decisions include  but are not limited to  the quality and potential profitability of the business under consideration  and our profitability and ability to finance the transaction 
acquisitions during during we acquired visiting nurse branch locations 
these operations added to our market presence in florida  connecticut  ohio and kentucky and gave us market presence in new jersey and pennsylvania 
we funded these acquisitions by issuing million in almost family restricted stock  issuing million in promissory notes at interest  and using existing cash and our senior credit facility with jp morgan chase bank  na to make cash payments of million and provide a million letter of credit as collateral for patient care  inc s large deductible workers compensation exposure 
acquisitions during during the company acquired visiting nurse branch locations

we funded these acquisitions by issuing million in almost family restricted stock and using existing cash and our senior credit facility with jp morgan chase bank  na to make cash payments of million 
contractual obligations 
the following table provides information about the payment dates of our contractual obligations at december   excluding current liabilities except for the current portion of long term debt and additional consideration on mederi acquisition amounts in thousands total revolving credit facility capital lease obligations additional consideration on acquisitions notes payable operating leases total commitments and contingencies letters of credit 
we have outstanding letters of credit totaling million at december   which benefit our third party insurer administrators for our self insurance programs 
the amount of such insurance program letters of credit is subject to negotiation annually upon renewal and may vary in the future based upon such negotiation  our historical claims experience and expected future claims 
it is reasonable to expect that the amount of the letter of credit will increase in the future  however  we are unable to predict to what degree 
we currently have no obligations related to acquisition agreements 
however  we periodically seek acquisition candidates and may reasonably be expected to enter into acquisitions in the future 
general and professional liability 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we also know of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we carry insurance coverage for this exposure with no deductible 
we record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we monitor our estimated insurance related liabilities on a monthly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
health care reform the health care industry has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  extensive and dynamic change 
in addition to economic forces and regulatory influences  continuing political debate is subjecting the health care industry to significant reform 
health care reforms have been enacted as discussed elsewhere in this document 
proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government  congress  and state legislatures 
government officials can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities  the relative cost of doing business  and the methods and amounts of payments for medical care by both governmental and other payors 
legislative changes to balance the budget and slow the annual rate of growth of expenditures are expected to continue 
such future changes may further impact our reimbursement 
there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
federal and state legislative proposals continue to be introduced that would impose more limitations on payments to providers of health care services such as us 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures 
we cannot predict what additional government regulations may be enacted in the future affecting our business or how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted  or whether we will be able to comply with such laws and regulations in our existing or future markets 
discontinued operations we follow the guidance in sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and  when appropriate  reclassify operating units closed  sold  or held for sale out of continuing operations and into discontinued operations for all periods presented 
during  we had no facilities that met the criteria to be reclassified as discontinued operations and during  the pc segment had three facilities and the vn segment had one facility that met the criteria to be reclassified as discontinued operations 
for all the years presented in this report  these facilities have been reclassified 
net losses from the discontinued operations were approximately   and  in the years ended december   and respectively  and such amounts are included in net loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years 
non gaap financial measure the information provided in the some of the tables use certain non gaap financial measures as defined under securities and exchange commission sec rules 
in accordance with sec rules  the company has provided  in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables  a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures 
ebitda ebitda is defined as income before depreciation and amortization  net interest expense and income taxes 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities  or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity 
management routinely calculates and communicates ebitda and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance  measure leverage capacity and debt service ability  and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value 
ebitda is also used in certain covenants contained in our credit agreement 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of continuing operations net income to ebitda year ended december  net income from continuing operations add back interest income expense income taxes depreciation and amortization amortization of stock based compensation earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda from continuing operations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments we do not use derivative instruments 
market risk of financial instruments our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of approximately  in annual pre tax earnings
