item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements congress passed the private securities litigation act of to encourage corporations to provide investors with information about the company s anticipated future financial performance  goals  and strategies 
the act provides a safe haven for such disclosure  in other words  protection from unwarranted litigation if actual results are not the same as management expectations 
united desires to provide its shareholders with sound information about past performance and future trends 
consequently  any forward looking statements contained in this report  in a report incorporated by reference to this report  or made by management of united in this report  in any other reports and filings  in press releases and in oral statements  involve numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by united s statements for a variety of factors including  but not limited to changes in economic conditions  business conditions in the banking industry  movements in interest rates  competitive pressures on product pricing and services  success and timing of business strategies  the nature and extent of governmental actions and reforms  and rapidly changing technology and evolving banking industry standards 
introduction the following discussion and analysis presents the significant changes in financial condition and the results of operations of united and its subsidiaries for the periods indicated below 
this discussion and the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements include the accounts of united bankshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  unless otherwise indicated 
on july   united acquired of the outstanding common stock of premier community bankshares  inc premier of winchester  virginia 
the results of operations of premier  which are not significant  are included in the consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 
because the results of operations of premier are not significant  pro forma information is not provided 
the purchase price was allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets resulting in additions to goodwill and core deposit intangibles of approximately million and million  respectively 
as a result of the merger  united assumed approximately million of liabilities to provide severance benefits to terminated employees of premier 
a balance of thousand remains as of december  for the assumed liabilities to provide several benefits to terminated employees of premier 
the acquisition of premier expanded united s presence in the rapidly growing and economically attractive metro dc area and afforded united the opportunity to enter new virginia markets in the winchester  harrisonburg and charlottesville areas 
prior to july   united operated two main business segments community banking and mortgage banking 
as previously reported  on july   united sold its wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiary  george mason mortgage  llc mason mortgage 
united s mortgage banking activities were conducted primarily through mason mortgage  which was previously reported as a separate segment 
for the years prior to  mason mortgage is shown as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
since the sale of mason mortgage  united s operations relate mainly to community banking which offers customers traditional banking products and services  including loan and deposit products  and wealth management services which include investment banking  financial planning  trust and brokerage services 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this document 
application of critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of united conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and 
table of contents judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses  income taxes  and the valuation of retained interests in securitized financial assets to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such  could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the most significant accounting policies followed by united are presented in note a  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the lending portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and the appropriate provision for credit losses is based upon a quarterly evaluation of the loan portfolio and lending related commitments 
this evaluation is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of estimated future cash flows  value of collateral  losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends  all of which are susceptible to constant and significant change 
the allowance allocated to specific credits and loan pools grouped by similar risk characteristics is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as necessary based upon subsequent changes in circumstances 
in determining the components of the allowance for credit losses  management considers the risk arising in part from  but not limited to  charge off and delinquency trends  current economic and business conditions  lending policies and procedures  the size and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  concentrations of credit  and other various factors 
the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses is described in note a  notes to consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of the factors leading to changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the provision for credit losses section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for a discussion of concentrations of credit risk  see item  under the caption of loan concentrations in this form k 
united uses derivative instruments as part of its risk management activities to protect the value of certain assets and liabilities against adverse price or interest rate movements 
all derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
the valuation of these derivative instruments is considered critical because carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are provided by third party sources 
because the majority of the derivative instruments are used to protect the value of other assets and liabilities on the balance sheet  changes in the value of the derivative instruments are typically offset by changes in the value of the assets and liabilities being hedged  although income statement volatility can occur if the derivative instruments are not effective in hedging changes in the value of those assets and liabilities 
united s calculation of income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination 
as part of united s analysis and implementation of business strategies  consideration is given to tax laws and regulations that may affect the transaction under evaluation 
this analysis includes the amount and timing of the realization of income tax liabilities or benefits 
united strives to keep abreast of changes in the tax laws and the issuance of regulations which may impact tax reporting and provisions for income tax expense 
united is also subject to audit by federal and state authorities 
because the application of tax laws is subject to varying interpretations  results of these audits may produce indicated liabilities which differ from united s estimates and provisions 
united continually evaluates its exposure to possible tax assessments arising from audits and records its estimate of probable exposure based on current facts and circumstances 
any material effect on the financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is further discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
use of fair value measurements on january   united adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas to determine the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in sfas  which also clarifies that fair value of certain assets and liabilities is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
fas establishes a three level hierarchy for disclosure of 
table of contents assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 
the classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs in the methodology for determining fair value are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market based information obtained from independent sources level or level  while unobservable inputs reflect management s estimate of market data level 
for assets and liabilities that are actively traded and have quoted prices or observable market data  a minimal amount of subjectivity concerning fair value is needed 
prices and values obtained from third party vendors that do not reflect forced liquidation or distressed sales are not adjusted by management 
when quoted prices or observable market data are not available  management s judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
at december   approximately of total assets  or billion  consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value 
of this total  approximately or billion of these financial instruments used valuation methodologies involving observable market data  collectively level and level measurements  to determine fair value 
approximately or million of these financial instruments were valued using unobservable market information or level measurements 
most of these financial instruments valued using unobservable market information were pooled trust preferred investment securities classified as available for sale 
at december   only million or less than of total liabilities were recorded at fair value 
this entire amount was valued using methodologies involving observable market data 
united does not believe that any changes in the unobservable inputs used to value the financial instruments mentioned above would have a material impact on united s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
see note t for additional information regarding sfas and its impact on united s financial statements 
recent developments on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
pursuant to the eesa  the us treasury will have the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
the eesa also included a provision to increase the amount of deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to on october   secretary paulson  after consulting with the federal reserve and the fdic  announced that the us treasury will purchase stakes in a wide variety of us banks and thrifts to encourage these institutions to build capital to increase the flow of financing to us businesses and consumers and to support the us economy 
under this program  known as the troubled asset relief program capital purchase program the tarp capital purchase program  the treasury will make billion of capital available to qualifying us financial institutions in the form of preferred stock 
in conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock  the treasury will receive warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the preferred investment 
participating financial institutions will be required to adopt the us treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the us treasury holds equity issued under the tarp capital purchase program 
these standards generally apply to the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  plus the next three most highly compensated executive officers 
also on october   after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the fdic and the federal reserve  and consulting with the president  secretary paulson signed the systemic risk exception to the fdic act  enabling the fdic to temporarily provide a guarantee of the senior debt of all fdic insured institutions and their holding companies  as well as deposits in non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts under a temporary liquidity guarantee program 
coverage under the temporary liquidity guarantee program was available for days without charge and thereafter at a cost of basis points per annum for senior unsecured debt and basis points per annum for non interest bearing transaction deposits 
on january   united announced that it decided not to participate in the us treasury s tarp capital purchase program 
united had received preliminary approval to receive up to million of capital from the tarp capital purchase program 
united s management and board of directors  after careful consideration  believed it was in the best interests of united s shareholders not to participate 
the program s restrictions on possible future dividend increases  the dilution to earnings  and the uncertainty surrounding future requirements of the program outweighed the benefits of united s participation in the program 

table of contents united has elected to take part in the fdic s transaction account guarantee program and is eligible for participation in the fdic s debt guarantee program  both are part of the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program 
the transaction account guarantee program provides a full guarantee on all non interest bearing transaction accounts held by any depositor  regardless of dollar amount  through december  additionally  united is eligible for participation in the fdic s debt guarantee program  which provides for the guarantee of eligible newly issued senior unsecured debt of participating entities 
compared to financial condition summary united s total assets as of december  were billion  an increase of million or from year end the increase was primarily the result of growth in portfolio loans of million or and an increase in other assets of million or 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of million and million  respectively 
the increase in total assets is reflected in a corresponding increase in total liabilities of million or from year end the increase in total liabilities was due mainly to growth in deposits of million or which more than offset a reduction of million or in borrowings 
shareholders equity decreased million or from year end the following discussion explains in more detail the changes in financial condition by major category 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents decreased million or from year end of this total decrease  cash and due from banks decreased million or  interest bearing deposits with other banks increased million or  and federal funds sold decreased million or 
during the year of  net cash of million and million was provided by operating and financing activities  respectively 
net cash of million was used in investing activities 
further details related to changes in cash and cash equivalents are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
securities total investment securities decreased million or since year end securities available for sale decreased million or due to million in sales  maturities and calls of securities  million in purchases and a decrease of million in market value 
securities held to maturity declined million or from year end due to calls and maturities of securities 
other investment securities decreased million or the following is a summary of available for sale securities at december in thousands us treasury and other us government agencies and corporations states and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities marketable equity securities corporate securities total available for sale securities  at amortized cost total available for sale securities  at fair value 
table of contents the following is a summary of held to maturity securities at december in thousands us treasury and other us government agencies and corporations states and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities corporate securities total held to maturity securities  at amortized cost total held to maturity securities  at fair value gross unrealized losses on investment securities were million at december  securities in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more at december  consisted primarily of corporate securities 
these corporate securities were mainly single issue trust preferred securities and trust preferred collateralized debt obligations 
as of december   united s corporate securities had an amortized cost of million  with an estimated fair value of million 
during the first quarter of  two securities in this portfolio matured at par  reducing the amortized cost by million  or approximately 
the remaining portfolio consisted primarily of million in pooled trust preferred securities  with a fair value of million  and million in single issue trust preferred securities with an estimated fair value of million 
in addition to the trust preferred securities  the company held positions in various other securities totaling million  none of which were individually significant 
the pooled trust preferred securities consisted of positions in different securities 
the underlying issuers in the pools were primarily financial institutions and to a lesser extent  insurance companies 
the company has no exposure to real estate investment trusts reits in its investment portfolio 
all pooled trust preferred securities are receiving full scheduled principal and interest payments 
the company owns both senior and mezzanine tranches in pooled trust preferred securities  however  the company does not own any income notes 
the senior and mezzanine tranches of trust preferred collateralized debt obligations generally have protection from defaults in the form of over collateralization and excess spread revenues  along with waterfall structures that redirect cash flows in the event certain coverage test requirements are failed 
generally  senior tranches have the greatest protection  with mezzanine tranches subordinated to the senior tranches  and income notes subordinated to the mezzanine tranches 
senior tranches represent million of the company s pooled securities  while mezzanine tranches represent million 
of the million in mezzanine tranches  million are now in the senior position as the senior notes have been paid to a zero balance 
as of december   million of the pooled trust preferred securities were investment grade  while million were split rated with one investment grade rating and one below investment grade rating 
in terms of capital adequacy  the company allocates additional risk based capital to the below investment grade securities 
of the million in single issue trust preferred securities at december   million or were investment grade  million or were unrated  million or were split rated  and million or were below investment grade 
the two largest exposures accounted for of the million 
these included royal bank of canada at million and wells fargo at million 
all single issue trust preferred securities are currently receiving full scheduled principal and interest payments 
management does not believe any individual security with an unrealized loss as of december  is other than temporarily impaired 
united believes the decline in value resulted from changes in market interest rates  credit spreads and liquidity  not a change in the probability of contractual cash flows 
based on a review of each of the securities in the investment portfolio  management concluded that it was not probable that it would be unable to realize the cost basis investment and appropriate interest payments on such securities 
united has the intent and the ability to hold these securities until such time as the value recovers or the securities mature 
however  united acknowledges that any impaired securities may be sold in future periods in response to significant  unanticipated changes in asset liability management decisions  unanticipated future market movements or business plan changes

net interest income net interest income represents the primary component of united s earnings 
it is the difference between interest income from earning assets and interest expense incurred to fund these assets 
net interest income is impacted by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as changes in market interest rates

tax equivalent net interest income for the year of was million  an increase of million or from the year of the net interest margin for the year of was  down basis points from a net interest margin of during the same period last year 
tax equivalent interest income for the year of was million  an million or decrease from the year of this decrease in tax equivalent interest income was primarily attributable to a decrease of basis points in the yield on average earning assets due to a decrease in market interest rates

provision for credit losses at december   nonperforming loans were million or of loans  net of unearned income compared to nonperforming loans of million or of loans  net of unearned income at december  the increase in nonperforming loans since year end is indicative of the decline in economic conditions 
these nonperforming loans are not of one particular portfolio  but rather represent several customer segments 
higher unemployment levels  economic fears  and declines in real estate values have impacted the performance of both consumer and commercial portfolios 
the components of nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans  which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal  but have not been put on a nonaccrual basis 
loans past due days or more were million at december   a decrease of million or from million at year end at year end  nonaccrual loans were million  an increase of million or from million at year end the increase in nonaccrual loans since year end was primarily the result of the deterioration in economic conditions during the loss potential on these loans has been properly evaluated and allocated within the company s allowance for loan losses

management is not aware of any other significant loans or securities  groups of loans or securities  or segments of the loan or investment portfolio not included below or disclosed elsewhere herein where there are serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers or issuers to comply with the present repayment terms of the debt 
the following table summarizes nonperforming assets for the indicated periods 
december in thousands nonaccrual loans loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal  and are still accruing interest total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets loans are designated as impaired when  in the opinion of management  the collection of principal and interest in accordance with the loan contract is doubtful 
at december   impaired loans were million  which was an increase of million or from the million in impaired loans at december  generally  the increase in impaired loans from year end is indicative of a weakened credit environment due to a deterioration of economic conditions 
specifically  the increase in impaired loans was due partially to the addition of million of commercial loans to a rental car agency and million of commercial and personal loans to an automobile dealer 
most of these credits are collateralized by motor vehicle inventory or real estate 
in addition  several residential real estate construction loans totaling approximately million were added during the year of the loans are collateralized by land  some with partially completed homes 
the remainder of the increase is primarily due to six large commercial credits totaling million that were added during the year of most of these loans are to commercial real estate developers 
based on current information and events  united believes it is probable that the borrowers will not be able to repay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements 
the loss potential on these loans has been properly evaluated and allocated within the company s allowance for loan losses 
for further details on impaired loans  see note e  notes to consolidated financial statements 
united maintains an allowance for loan losses and an allowance for lending related commitments 
the combined allowances for loan losses and lending related commitments are referred to as the allowance for credit losses 
at december   the allowance for credit losses was million  compared to million at december  as a percentage of loans  net of unearned income  the allowance for credit losses was and at december  and  respectively 
the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was and at december  and  respectively

united evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and its loan administration policies are focused upon the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
united s process for evaluating the allowance is a formal company wide process that focuses on early identification of potential problem credits and procedural discipline in managing and accounting for those credits 
this process determines the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses  allocation among loan types 
table of contents and lending related commitments  and the resulting provision for credit losses 
allocations are made for specific commercial loans based upon management s estimate of the borrowers ability to repay and other factors impacting collectibility 
other commercial loans not specifically reviewed on an individual basis are evaluated based on historical loss percentages applied to loan pools that have been segregated by risk 
allocations for loans other than commercial loans are made based upon historical loss experience adjusted for current environmental conditions 
the allowance for credit losses includes estimated probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates  and risk factors that have not yet fully manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
in addition  a portion of the allowance accounts for the inherent imprecision in the allowance for credit losses analysis 
over the past several years  united has grown through acquisition  and accordingly  expanded the geographic area in which it operates 
as a result  historical loss experience data used to establish allocation estimates might not precisely correspond to the current portfolio in these other geographic areas 
the following table presents the allocation of united s allowance for credit losses for each of the five years ended december december in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate real estate construction consumer and other lending related commitments allowance for estimated imprecision less allowance for credit losses  discontinued operations total united s formal company wide process at december  produced increased allocations in all of the four loan categories 
the components of the allowance allocated to commercial loans increased by million due to the impact of an increase in historical loss rates  increased outstandings in the watch loan pool  an increase in qualitative factors for business and economic conditions and higher specific allocations on impaired loans 
the real estate loan pool allocations increased million also as a result of increases in historical loss rates  qualitative factors and allocations for pool subsets having higher levels of risk 
the real estate construction loan pool allocations increased million primarily due to increased specific allocations of impaired loans and allocations for pool subsets having higher levels of risk 
the components of the allowance allocated to consumer loans increased by thousand due to an increase in qualitative factors as well an increase in the allocation for overdraft loss 
the methodology for calculation of the unfunded commitments liability was changed to be more consistent with the historical utilization of unfunded commitments and this resulted in a decrease of million 
an allowance is established for probable credit losses on impaired loans via specific allocations 
nonperforming commercial loans and leases are regularly reviewed to identify impairment 
a loan or lease is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will not be able to collect all amounts contractually due 
measuring impairment of a loan requires judgment and estimates  and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates 

table of contents impairment is measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows from the loan discounted at the loan s effective rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the selected measure is less than the recorded investment in the loan  an impairment has occurred 
the allowance for impaired loans was million at december  and million at december  compared to the prior year end  this element of the allowance increased by million due to the combination of increased commercial and real estate construction and development loan pool allocations 
an allowance is also recognized for imprecision inherent in loan loss migration models and other estimates of loss 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending related commitments  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its methodology for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors to identify and quantify probable losses in the portfolio  the process includes subjective elements and is therefore susceptible to change 
this estimate for imprecision has been established to recognize the variance  within a reasonable margin  of the loss estimation process 
the estimate for imprecision increased at december  by million to million 
this represents of the bank s total allowance for credit loss and in as much as this variance approximates a pre determined narrow parameter  the methodology has confirmed that the company s allowance for credit loss is at an appropriate level 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses of million at december  is adequate to provide for probable losses on existing loans and lending related commitments based on information currently available 
united s loan administration policies are focused on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio in terms of loan approval and credit quality 
the commercial loan portfolio is monitored for possible concentrations of credit in one or more industries 
management has lending limits as a percentage of capital per type of credit concentration in an effort to ensure adequate diversification within the portfolio 
most of united s commercial loans are secured by real estate located in west virginia  southeastern ohio  virginia and maryland 
it is the opinion of management that these commercial loans do not pose any unusual risks and that adequate consideration has been given to these loans in establishing the allowance for credit losses 
management is not aware of any potential problem loans  trends or uncertainties  which it reasonably expects  will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources which have not been disclosed 
additionally  management has disclosed all known material credits  which cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment schedules 
other income other income consists of all revenues  which are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets 
noninterest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for improving united s profitability 
recognizing the importance  management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced 
noninterest income was million for the year of  up million or from the year of included in noninterest income for the year of were noncash before tax other than temporary impairment charges on investment securities totaling million and a thousand gain related to visa s initial public offering and the partial redemption of visa shares held by united

noninterest income for the year of was million which included an million before tax loss on the termination of interest rate swaps associated with the prepayment of fhlb advances

in particular  insufficient funds nsf fees and check card fees increased million or and million or  respectively  for the year of as compared to the same period in in addition  account analysis fees increased thousand from year end 
table of contents trust income and brokerage commissions increased million or due to a greater volume of business and a larger customer base 
united continues its efforts to broaden the scope and activity of its trust and brokerage service areas  especially in the northern virginia market  to provide additional sources of fee income that complement united s traditional banking products and services 
the northern virginia market provides a relatively large number of potential customers with high per capita incomes 
mortgage banking income decreased thousand or due to fewer mortgage loan sales in the secondary market during the year of as compared to mortgage loan sales were million in as compared to million in for the year  income from bank owned life insurance policies decreased million or due mainly to a decrease in cash surrender value while fees from bankcard transactions decreased thousand or due to decreased volume as a result of less consumer spending compared to the year of other income increased million or for the year of as compared to last year s income during the same period 
this increase in other income is due mainly to an increase of million in the fair value of certain derivative financial instruments not in a hedging relationship with a similar amount of expense related to a decline in the fair value of derivative financial instruments included in other expense 
income from the outsourcing of official checks processing for the year of decreased thousand over the same period last year 
the outsourcing of official checks processing was discontinued in and brought in house 
other expense just as management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced  it strives to improve the efficiency of its operations to reduce costs 
other expense includes all items of expense other than interest expense  the provision for credit losses and income tax expense 
noninterest expense for the year of was million  an increase of million or from the year of results for the year of included merger expenses and related integration costs of the premier acquisition of million as well as before tax penalties of million to prepay fhlb advances

equipment expense  including other real estate owned oreo  increased million or for the year of as compared to the year of the increase from was due mainly to an increase in losses due to deterioration in property values associated with oreo 
data processing expense increased million or for the year of as compared to the year of the increase was primarily due to additional outsourcing of processing functions and a change in processing procedures in addition to the premier merger 
the expense for outsourcing of functions was partially offset by a reduction in personnel expense while the change in processing procedures is expected to result in future cost savings as united meets the requirements of check bankcard processing fees decreased thousand or due to decreased transactions as a result of less consumer spending for the year of as compared to last year 
other expenses increased million or for the year of as compared to the year of due mainly to an increase of million from a decline in the fair value of derivatives not in a hedging relationship 
amortization of core deposit intangibles for the year of increased thousand from the same time period in due to the premier merger 
marketing and related costs of united s high performance checking program increased thousand in the year of as compared to the year of in addition  several general operating expenses such as postage  telephone  atm

during the third quarter of  united reduced its income tax reserve by million as compared to a reduction of million due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for examination of certain years 
as of january   the state of west virginia changed its method of taxation to a unitary combined reporting of income for corporations taxable in west virginia 
a unitary business is defined as a commonly controlled group of businesses 
combined reporting is a tax reporting method where all of the members of a unitary group are required to determine their net income based on the activities of the unitary group as a whole 
the resulting impact to united will be an increase in state income tax expense of approximately to in the effective tax rate 
quarterly results the first quarter of remained consistent in diluted earnings per share in comparison to the same quarter in net income for the first quarter of was million or per diluted share basis compared to million or per diluted share in for the second quarter of  net income was million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share in in the third quarter of  earnings were million or per diluted share as compared to million or per diluted share in the third quarter of the results for the third quarter of included a noncash before tax other than temporary impairment charge of million on a corporate debt holding and a positive tax adjustment of million due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for examinations of certain years 
fourth quarter of net income was million or per diluted share as compared to million or per diluted share in the fourth quarter of the results for the fourth quarter saw an increase in the provision for credit losses of million from the same time periods in due mainly to increases in nonperforming assets  loan charge offs and inherent risk factors as a result of the current economic conditions

the results for the fourth quarter of included charges of million to prepay certain fhlb long term advances and terminate associated interest rate swaps 
tax equivalent net interest income for the fourth quarter of was million  an increase of million or from the fourth quarter of this increase in tax equivalent net interest income was primarily attributable to an increase of million or in average earning assets as average net loans grew million or from the fourth quarter of in addition  the average cost of funds declined basis points for the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of the decrease in the average cost of funds was due mainly to a decrease in market interest rates 
partially offsetting these increases in net interest income was a decline of basis points in the average yield on earning assets due to the decrease in market interest rates 
the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was  a decrease of basis points from a net interest margin of for the fourth quarter of for the quarters ended december  and  the provision for credit losses was million and million  respectively 
these higher amounts of provision expense and net charge offs for reflected a weakened credit environment due to a deterioration of economic conditions 
net charge offs were million for the fourth quarter of as compared to million for the fourth quarter of 
table of contents noninterest income for the fourth quarter of was million  an increase of million from the fourth quarter of the increase was mainly due to a before tax loss of approximately million during the fourth quarter of on the termination of an interest rate swap associated with the prepayment of a fhlb advance 
net losses on investment securities were million for the fourth quarter of as compared to net losses of thousand for the fourth quarter of net losses on investment securities for the fourth quarter of included a noncash before tax other than temporary impairment charge of thousand on certain marketable equity securities 
excluding the amounts associated with the interest rate swap termination and security transactions  noninterest income for the fourth quarter of would have increased million or from the fourth quarter of this increase primarily resulted from an increase of million in the fair value of derivatives not in a hedging relationship

net occupancy expense increased thousand or due mainly to increases in building maintenance and lease expense 
additional quarterly financial data for and may be found in note u  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the effect of inflation united s income statements generally reflect the effects of inflation 
since interest rates  loan demand and deposit levels are impacted by inflation  the resulting changes in the interest sensitive assets and liabilities are included in net interest income 
similarly  operating expenses such as salaries  rents and maintenance include changing prices resulting from inflation 
one item that would not reflect inflationary changes is depreciation expense 
subsequent to the acquisition of depreciable assets  inflation causes price levels to rise  therefore  historically presented dollar values do not reflect this inflationary condition 
with inflation levels at relatively low levels and monetary and fiscal policies being implemented to keep the inflation rate increases within an acceptable range  management expects the impact of inflation would continue to be minimal in the near future 
the effect of regulatory policies and economic conditions united s business and earnings are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities 
the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve board are i conducting open market operations in united states government obligations  ii changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings  iii imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits  and iv restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
united s business and earnings are also affected by general and local economic conditions 
late in and for most of  certain credit markets experienced difficult conditions and volatility 
downturns in the credit market can cause a decline in the value of certain loans and securities  a reduction in liquidity and a tightening of credit 
a downturn in the credit market often signals a weakening economy that can cause job losses and thus distress on borrowers and their ability to repay loans 
uncertainties in credit markets and the economy present significant challenges for the financial services industry 

table of contents regulatory policies and economic conditions have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future  however  united cannot accurately predict the nature  timing or extent of any effect such policies or economic conditions may have on its future business and earnings 
contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities and off balance sheet arrangements united has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments  that may require future cash payments 
the table below presents  by payment date  significant known contractual obligations to third parties as of december  total payments due by period one year one to three to over five in thousands total or less three years five years years deposits without a stated maturity time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings operating leases excludes interest 
includes interest on both fixed and variable rate obligations 
the interest associated with variable rate obligations is based upon interest rates in effect at december  the interest to be paid on variable rate obligations is affected by changes in market interest rates  which materially affect the contractual obligation amounts to be paid 
excludes carrying value adjustments such as unamortized premiums or discounts 
on january   united adopted the provisions of fin as of december   united recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions  including interest and penalties  of million in accordance with fin this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that united has taken in its tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty  this estimated liability is excluded from the contractual obligations table 
united also enters into derivative contracts  mainly to protect against adverse interest rate movements on the value of certain assets or liabilities  under which it is required to either pay cash to or receive cash from counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value and not notional value on the consolidated balance sheet 
because the derivative contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december  do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts  they are excluded from the preceding table 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in note p  notes to consolidated financial statements 
united is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
united s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for the loan commitments and standby letters of credit is the contractual or notional amount of those instruments 
united uses the same policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 

table of contents the following tables detail the amounts of significant commitments and letters of credit as of december  in thousands amount commitments to extend credit revolving open end secured by residential credit card and personal revolving lines commercial total unused commitments financial standby letters of credit performance standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit total letters of credit commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses  generally within one year  and may require the payment of a fee 
further discussion of commitments is included in note o  notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity in the opinion of management  united maintains liquidity that is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and the credit needs of its customers 
like all banks  united depends upon its ability to renew maturing deposits and other liabilities on a daily basis and to acquire new funds in a variety of markets 
a significant source of funds available to united is core deposits 
core deposits include certain demand deposits  statement and special savings and now accounts 
these deposits are relatively stable and they are the lowest cost source of funds available to united 
short term borrowings have also been a significant source of funds 
these include federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase as well as advances from the fhlb 
repurchase agreements represent funds that are obtained as the result of a competitive bidding process 
liquid assets are cash and those items readily convertible to cash 
all banks must maintain sufficient balances of cash and near cash items to meet the day to day demands of customers and united s cash needs 
other than cash and due from banks  the available for sale securities portfolio and maturing loans are the primary sources of liquidity 
the goal of liquidity management is to ensure the ability to access funding that enables united to efficiently satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and meet united s cash needs 
liquidity is managed by monitoring funds availability from a number of primary sources 
substantial funding is available from cash and cash equivalents  unused short term borrowings  and a geographically dispersed network of branches providing access to a diversified and substantial retail deposit market 
short term needs can be met through a wide array of outside sources such as correspondent and downstream correspondent federal funds and utilization of federal home loan bank advances 
other sources of liquidity available to united to provide long term as well as short term funding alternatives  in addition to fhlb advances  are long term certificates of deposit  lines of credit  borrowings that are secured by bank premises or stock of united s subsidiaries and issuances of trust preferred securities 
in the normal course of business  united through its asset liability committee evaluates these as well as other alternative funding strategies that may be utilized to meet short term and long term funding needs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of united s asset liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within united s policy guidelines 
this objective is accomplished through the management of balance sheet liquidity and interest rate risk exposures due to changes in economic conditions  interest rate levels and customer preferences 
interest rate risk management considers interest rate risk to be united s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in united s net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
united s earnings are largely dependent on the effective management of interest rate risk 
management of interest rate risk focuses on maintaining consistent growth in net interest income within board approved policy limits 
united s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives and reports to the board of directors  monitors and manages interest rate risk to maintain an acceptable level of change to net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
policy established for interest rate risk is stated in terms of the change in net interest income over a one year and two year horizon given an immediate and sustained increase or decrease in interest rates 
the current limits approved by the board of directors are structured on a staged basis with each stage requiring specific actions 
united employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its exposure to changing interest rates 
one such technique utilizes an earnings simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates 
the model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off balance sheet instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rate of certain assets and liabilities 
the model also includes executive management projections for activity levels in product lines offered by united 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
rate scenarios could involve parallel or nonparallel shifts in the yield curve  depending on historical  current  and expected conditions  as well as the need to capture any material effects of explicit or embedded options 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management s strategies 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are defined as those assets or liabilities that mature or are repriced within a designated time frame 
the principal function of managing interest rate risk is to maintain an appropriate relationship between those assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changing market interest rates 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities for specified periods of time is known as the gap 
earnings simulation analysis captures not only the potential of these interest sensitive assets and liabilities to mature or reprice  but also the probability that they will do so 
moreover  earnings simulation analysis considers the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet items and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
united closely monitors the sensitivity of its assets and liabilities on an on going basis and projects the effect of various interest rate changes on its net interest margin 
the following table shows united s estimated consolidated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  and change in interest rates percentage change in net interest income basis points december  december  given an immediate  sustained basis point upward shock to the yield curve used in the simulation model  it is estimated that net interest income for united would increase by over one year as of december   as compared to an increase of as of december  a basis point immediate  sustained upward shock in the yield curve would 
table of contents increase net interest income by an estimated over one year as of december   as compared to an increase of as of december  a basis point immediate  sustained downward shock in the yield curve would decrease net interest income by an estimated over one year as of december  as compared to a decrease of over one year as of december  with the federal funds rate at at december   management believed a basis point immediate  sustained decline in rates was highly unlikely 
a basis point immediate  sustained downward shock in the yield curve would have decreased net interest income by an estimated over one year as of december  this analysis does not include the potential increased refinancing activities  which should lessen the negative impact on net income from falling rates 
while it is unlikely market rates would immediately move or basis points upward or downward on a sustained basis  this is another tool used by management and the board of directors to gauge interest rate risk 
all of these estimated changes in net interest income are and were within the policy guidelines established by the board of directors 
to further aid in interest rate management  united s subsidiary banks are members of the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the use of fhlb advances provides united with a low risk means of matching maturities of earning assets and interest bearing funds to achieve a desired interest rate spread over the life of the earning assets 
in addition  united uses credit with large regional banks and trust preferred securities to provide funding 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  united may use derivative instruments to protect against adverse price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets or liabilities and on future cash flows 
these derivatives commonly consist of interest rate swaps  caps  floors  collars  futures  forward contracts  written and purchased options 
interest rate swaps obligate two parties to exchange one or more payments generally calculated with reference to a fixed or variable rate of interest applied to the notional amount 
united accounts for its derivative activities in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
during the year of  united realized a net loss of million in connection with the termination of interest rate swaps 
this was done to improve future earnings 
extension risk a key feature of most mortgage loans is the ability of the borrower to repay principal earlier than scheduled 
this is called a prepayment 
prepayments arise primarily due to sale of the underlying property  refinancing  or foreclosure 
in general  declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments  and rising interest rates tend to slow prepayments 
like other fixed income securities  when interest rates rise  the value of mortgage related securities generally decline 
the rate of prepayments on underlying mortgages will affect the price and volatility of mortgage related securities and may shorten or extend the effective maturity of the security beyond what was anticipated at the time of purchase 
if interest rates rise  united s holdings of mortgage related securities may experience reduced returns if the borrowers of the underlying mortgages pay off their mortgages later than anticipated 
this is generally referred to as extension risk 
at december   united s mortgage related securities portfolio had an amortized cost of million  of which approximately million or were fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
these fixed rate cmos consisted primarily of planned amortization class pacs  sequential pay and accretion directed vadms bonds having an average life of approximately years and a weighted average yield of  under current projected prepayment assumptions 
these securities are expected to have very little extension risk in a rising rate environment 
current models show that given an immediate  sustained upward shock of basis points  the average life of these securities would only extend to years 
the projected price decline of the fixed rate cmo portfolio in rates up basis points would be  less than the price decline of a year treasury note 
by comparison  the price decline of a year current coupon mortgage backed security mbs in rates higher by basis points would be approximately
