item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements of this form k for more information 
our conclusion that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset will be realized is dependent on a number of factors  including our near term earnings and taxable income projections 
to the extent these or certain other assumptions change materially  we may need to establish a valuation allowance against all or part of the deferred tax asset  which would adversely affect our results of operations and capital levels and ratios 
at december   we had million of deferred tax assets 
in assessing whether a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets was needed at december   we considered a number of positive factors 
these included the expectation of reversing taxable temporary differences in future periods  including the unrealized gain in our securities portfolio  and our expectation of generating a significant amount of taxable income over a relatively short time period 
we also considered the negative evidence associated with generating a cumulative pre tax loss for financial statement purposes  using a trailing three year period for purposes of this cumulative assessment 
our taxable income projections  which for this purpose are determined without regard to reversing temporary differences  are dependent in large part on our ability to significantly reverse our earnings results from we believe such a turnaround is likely  given that our results had substantial charges associated with our plan  including certain compensation costs and credit charges that we do not believe will be recurring 
in addition  the estimated timing of when deferred deductible items  such as loan charge offs  are expected to reverse also supports our conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed 
even though we believe a turnaround in our earnings performance in is likely  it is also highly likely that in and into  we will continue to be in a cumulative pre tax loss for financial statement purposes  using a trailing three year timeframe 
this will continue to be negative evidence in the assessment of whether a deferred tax asset valuation allowance is needed 
to the extent some of the positive evidence that we are relying on in our assessment fails to materialize  eg a failure to meet our internal earnings or taxable income forecasts  a substantial reduction in the unrealized gain in the 
table of contents investment securities portfolio or a conclusion that we need to change certain other assumptions  we may need to establish a valuation allowance against all or part of the deferred tax asset 
in addition  even if we continue to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed for gaap  we could be required to disallow all or a portion of the net deferred tax asset for bank regulatory purposes 
the assessment of whether the net deferred tax asset is disallowed  in whole or in part  for regulatory purposes is based on regulatory guidelines  which in some cases  are more restrictive than those of gaap 
although a disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory purposes would not impact our results of operations  it would reduce our regulatory capital ratios 
goodwill is an intangible asset and is subject to periodic impairment analysis 
certain facts or circumstances may indicate impairment that may lead us to recording an expense to write down this asset 
we had million in goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at december  goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the purchase method of accounting 
our goodwill was created as a result of several acquisitions we completed in prior years 
goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment 
if our stock price falls below our book value per share  this may signal a possible impairment of goodwill and we may need to undertake an impairment analysis before the end of our impairment determination would rely on  among other factors  a discounted cash flow analysis based on internal financial forecasts 
if the discounted cash flow analysis led us to a conclusion that the fair value was below its book value  it is more likely than not that we would incur an impairment charge for some or all of our goodwill 
changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition 
from time to time  the financial accounting standards board and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements 
various factors could depress the price of and affect trading activity in our common stock 
the price of our common stock can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations  earnings estimates and recommendations of securities analysts  the performance and stock price of other companies that investors and analysts deem comparable to us  the soundness or predicted soundness of other financial institutions  news reports regarding trends and issues in the financial services industry  actual or anticipated changes in the economy  the real estate markets  and interest rates  our capital markets activities  announcements of strategic developments  mergers  acquisitions and other material developments involving our peers  delays in  or a failure to realize the anticipated benefits of  an acquisition  
table of contents changes in legislation or regulation impacting the financial services industry in particular  or publicly traded companies in general  changes in economic policy of the us treasury and the federal reserve concerning management of the current financial crisis  regulatory enforcement or other actions against privatebancorp or its affiliates  and general market fluctuations 
fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult for you to sell your shares of our common stock at an attractive price 
any future sales of our shares of common or preferred stock will dilute our equity  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we expect that we will need to raise additional capital to support our growth and  if warranted  to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or preferred stock or the perception that such sales could occur  including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  common stock 
the issuance of additional common stock will further dilute the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders

table of contents recent developments troubled asset relief program tarp capital purchase program in response to the financial crises affecting the financial markets and the banking system  on october   the president signed into law the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa 
among other things  the eesa establishes a billion troubled asset relief program tarp 
under the tarp  the united states department of the treasury treasury has authority  among other things  to purchase mortgages  mortgage backed securities  capital stock  and other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the treasury announced several initiatives under the tarp intended to help stabilize the banking industry  including a voluntary capital purchase program cpp designed to encourage qualifying financial institutions to build capital 
under the cpp  the treasury may purchase up to billion of senior preferred shares from eligible financial institutions on standardized terms with attached warrants to purchase common stock 
on january   we received preliminary approval to issue to the treasury up to million of senior preferred shares  the maximum allowable to us under the cpp  and on january   consummated the issuance of the securities 
the senior preferred shares will pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years  and per year thereafter 
we also issued to the treasury a ten year warrant to purchase up to million shares of our common stock  or of the aggregate dollar amount of senior preferred shares purchased by the treasury  at an exercise price of per share 
proceeds from the issuance further bolster our already well capitalized regulatory total capital ratio as of december   which stood at  approximately million in excess of the level required to be considered adequately capitalized 
as a result of our participation in the tarp  we are subject to various restrictions on our ability to increase the cash dividends we pay on our common stock and our ability to repurchase shares of our stock 
we are also subject to various executive compensation and corporate governance restrictions  some of which were recently expanded in connection with the enactment of the american recovery and reinvestment act of on february  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic temporary liquidity guaranty program tlgp the fdic insures deposits at its insured financial institutions up to certain limits  charging institutions such as the banks premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund 
the eesa includes a provision for an increase in the amount of fdic insurance covering deposits held in certain types of accounts to  until december  under the tlgp  insured depository institutions that participate will be subject to a fee applied to non interest bearing transaction deposit account balances in excess of  which fee will be added to the institution s existing risk based deposit insurance assessments 
the tlgp also provides a three year guarantee of any newly issued senior unsecured debt that may be issued by the banks on or before june  including promissory notes  commercial paper  inter bank funding  and any unsecured portion of secured debt 
the maximum amount of the potential subsidiary bank debt that could be covered by this guarantee is approximately million 
the fdic will assess participating entities a fee based on a tiered fee schedule ranging from basis points to basis points  based on the term of the debt and the type of institution 
the fee is assessed only after the participating entity issues guaranteed debt 
as of december   none of the banks had any guaranteed bank debt outstanding 

table of contents the banks have elected to participate in the tlgp  although we have made no decision as to whether the banks will issue any senior unsecured debt 
because the company had no senior unsecured debt outstanding at september   it will not participate in the tlgp 
overview during  we continued the successful implementation of the strategic growth plan the plan 
we added key personnel  products  and infrastructure to expedite our goal of becoming the premier middle market commercial and commercial real estate bank in the markets we serve 
consequently  during the year we continued to see an increase in our non interest expense  but by the fourth quarter  the operating leverage that we set out to achieve in the plan became apparent 
we achieved many important goals in the first full year of the plan including our loan portfolio increased billion in  resulting in a dramatic increase in interest income and growth to billion in assets 
we diversified the loan portfolio  with commercial and industrial loans being our largest area of growth 
commercial and industrial loans are now of the portfolio  creating greater diversification 
our funding mix  while still reliant upon wholesale funding  included billion of client deposits at year end 
the middle market client base that we have attracted continues to be a valuable source of liquidity due to the fact that most clients maintain the majority of their core banking relationship with us 
additionally  our expanded client reach and product offering has allowed us to attract certain client relationships whose deposits exceed their lending needs 
increased fee income is a crucial part of the plan and during we were successful in expanding our treasury management  capital markets  letter of credit and wealth management services to substantially improve fee income to million 
we expect to continue to see strong cross sell of these products and services in and beyond 
we substantially invested in our risk infrastructure during the year  significantly improving the transparency of our loan portfolio  and have taken steps we believe were necessary to reduce additional potentially significant losses in the future 
we are executing our plan in unprecedented economic conditions  and privatebancorp was not immune to the challenging credit market during non performing asset levels and loan charge offs were significantly higher in than in prior periods  resulting in an increase in our allowance for loan losses 
as a result of rapid deterioration in economic conditions  during the fourth quarter we undertook a comprehensive review of all underperforming assets with a particular emphasis on our residential development loan portfolio 
this resulted in a substantial charge at year end in recognition that residential development is a very weak sector in several of our markets 
notably  none of the charges were related to loans originated as part of the plan  but were from the legacy loan portfolio 
we will continue to proactively monitor our loan portfolio during  and despite the challenging environment  we continue to see great opportunities to expand our franchise and grow our client base

the profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income  provision for loan losses  non interest income  and non interest expense 
net interest income is dependent on the amount of and yields earned on  interest earning assets as compared to the amount of and rates paid on  interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset liability management strategy 
the provision for loan losses is affected by changes in the loan portfolio  management s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio  loss experience  
table of contents as well as economic and market factors 
non interest income consists primarily of fee revenue from the private wealth group  capital market product income  treasury management fees  mortgage banking income  bank owned life insurance and fees for ancillary banking services 
net securities gains losses and net gains losses on interest rate swaps  if any  are also included in non interest income 
earnings performance net income our net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   and net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  compared to the prior year is primarily due to a provision for loan losses of million  offset by growth in net interest income generated by the implementation of our plan and revenue gains from new capital markets and treasury management product offerings 
during the fourth quarter  we performed a comprehensive loan portfolio review and  as a result  charged off million in loans during that quarter alone 
additionally  reflects the full year s impact of the implementation of our plan  including the expenses related thereto 
during the preparation of our form k and the related audited financial statements after the release of our fourth quarter earnings  we identified a million pre tax non interest operating expense reporting adjustment associated with certain employee benefit expense reconciliations which affected our fourth quarter and full year results of operation and balance sheet at december  this resulted in an adjustment to reported salaries and wages  non interest expense  income tax benefit and net loss for the fourth quarter and full year as well as an immaterial change to other assets  total assets  other liabilities  total liabilities  retained earnings and stockholders equity at december   compared to the amounts reported in our fourth quarter earnings release 
due to this adjustment the related performance ratios previously reported also changed by an immaterial amount including  basic and diluted earnings per share  return on average assets  return on average equity  efficiency ratio  capital ratios and certain nonperforming asset ratios for the quarter and year ended december  net interest income net interest income equals the difference between interest income plus fees earned on interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities impact net interest income 
net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of total average interest earning assets 
the accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans  securities  and other interest earning assets are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
our accounting and reporting policies conform to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and general practice within the banking industry 
for purposes of this discussion  both net interest income and net interest margin have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax exempt loans and securities to those on taxable interest earning assets 
although we believe that these non gaap financial measures enhance investors 
table of contents understanding of our business and performance  these non gaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to gaap 
the effect of such adjustment is presented in the following table table effect of tax equivalent adjustment years ended december  change amounts in thousands net interest income gaap tax equivalent adjustment tax equivalent net interest income table below summarizes changes in our average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities over the last three years as well as interest income and interest expense related to each category of assets and funding sources and the average interest rates earned and paid on each 
the table also shows the trend in net interest margin on a quarterly basis for and  including the tax equivalent yields on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities

the increase in net interest income for is primarily attributable to substantial growth in interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets for were billion compared to billion for  an increase of 
our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis declined to for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year primarily due to a basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets year over year  which was only partially offset by a basis point reduction in the cost of funds over the same period 
non interest bearing funds impact net interest margin since they represent non interest bearing sources of funds that are deployed in interest bearing assets 
non interest bearing funds positively impacted net interest margin by basis points for and basis point for net interest margin declined throughout due to continued decreases in the prime and libor rates of interest as our interest earning assets re price more quickly than our interest bearing deposits 
our net interest margin was further negatively impacted by the growth of non performing assets during the year  which grew to million at december  from million at december  during the year  we reversed approximately million in accrued interest income due to loans which became non performing 
the interest reversal during the year accounted for basis points of margin compression 
compared to a large portion of our funding is sensitive to movements in the short end of the yield curve  just as a large majority of our loan portfolio is effectively pegged off of the prime and libor rates 
our net interest margin was under pressure during due to the relatively flat yield curve 
during  we also continued to experience pressure on our margin due to decreases in the prime rate of interest and loans re pricing more quickly than deposits

as shown in tables and  tax equivalent net interest income in increased million compared to this was the result of a greater increase in interest income offset by a lesser increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest earning assets increased tax equivalent interest income by million  while a decline in the average rate earned on interest earning assets reduced 
table of contents interest income by million 
the increase in interest bearing liabilities increased interest expense by million  but the shift to lower costing money market accounts and the overall decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased interest expense by million 
the increase in both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is a reflection of the first full year of implementation in executing our plan 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for loan losses after net charge offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which  in management s best estimate  is necessary to absorb probable losses within the existing loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to loan growth and increased net charge offs which totaled million in compared to million in and  in the significant increase in net charge offs in was largely driven by the continued deterioration in the residential real estate development market conditions in certain of the key lending markets we operate in

compared to non interest income increased  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  of the million increase in non 
table of contents interest income during  approximately was due to the robust growth in fee income from our treasury management and capital markets groups 
one of the goals of the plan is to diversify non interest income by generating new sources of fee income through the offering of new products and services 
over the past year  we enhanced or introduced a variety of new products and services including capital markets products  lockbox  control disbursement  virtual vault  interest rate swaps  and foreign exchange services 
capital markets income was million for the year ended december  treasury management income was million for the year ended december   an increase from  for the year ended december  the strong growth in these groups demonstrates the cross sale success we are having with middle market clients 
the privatewealth group fee revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase from million for the year ended december  the year over year increase in the privatewealth group fee revenue was due to earnings on higher asset values prior to the significant decline in the debt and equity markets during fourth quarter and continued implementation of higher fees structures for certain clients relationships 
the privatewealth group assets under management were billion at december  a slight decrease from billion at december   with new business nearly offset by cash transfers to the banks cdars program and lower market values due to declining debt and equity markets 
banking and other services income increased approximately to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase from the prior year period is primarily due to an increase in letters of credit fees 
non interest income in includes net investment securities gains of  compared to net gains of  in the prior year period 
the increase in securities gains was due to gains realized in selective repositioning of the investment portfolio 
compared to non interest income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in non interest income during was primarily due to an increase in the privatewealth group fee revenue and also due to an increase in mortgage banking income 
the privatewealth group fee revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase from million for the year ended december  the year over year increase in the privatewealth group fee revenue was primarily due to the growth in net new business  an increase in the market value of accounts resulting in higher asset based fees and the change of fee structures for certain client relationships 
the privatewealth group assets under management increased to billion at december  compared to billion at december  mortgage banking income for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  mortgage banking income increased over this period due to a higher volume of loans sold 
banking and other services income decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease from the prior year period is primarily due to the inclusion of a million gain associated with the sale of fhlb advances during the second quarter as a result of the privatebank chicago s withdrawal of its fhlb

table of contents income taxes our provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income tax expense 
an analysis of the provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rates for the periods through are detailed in table table income tax provision analysis years ended december  dollars in thousands loss income before income tax provision income tax benefit provision effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate varies from the statutory federal income tax rate of principally due to state income taxes  the effects of tax exempt earnings from municipal securities and bank owned life insurance and non deductible compensation and business expenses 
due to the large loss before income tax provision in  the effects of the non taxable and non deductible items had an insignificant impact on the analysis of the effective tax benefit rate of  which varied from the federal income tax benefit rate of primarily due to state income tax benefits 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for compared to is a result of an increase in the proportion of tax exempt income  primarily interest on municipal securities  relative to income before taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets net deferred tax assets are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition 
as a result of the pre tax losses incurred during  we are in a cumulative pre tax loss position for financial statement purposes for the three year period ended december  under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  this represents significant negative evidence in the assessment of whether the deferred tax assets will be realized 
however  we have concluded that based on the weight given to other positive evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
in making this determination  we have considered the positive evidence associated with reversing taxable temporary differences in future periods  including income associated with the unrealized gains in our investment securities portfolio 
in our assessment  we also considered the relatively short time period over which we expect the deductions giving rise to the deferred tax assets to be claimed 
most significantly  however  we have relied on our ability to generate future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences primarily anticipated loan charge offs  over a relatively short time period 
deferred tax assets at december  represent the aggregate of federal and state tax assets  although federal taxes represent the primary component of the balance 
future federal taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences  of approximately million is necessary in order to fully absorb the federal deferred tax assets at december  for illinois purposes the primary state jurisdiction for which state deferred tax assets are generated  future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences  of approximately million is necessary in order to fully absorb the state deferred tax assets at december  
table of contents the level of pre tax earnings for financial reporting purposes in was not sufficient to generate the levels of future federal or state taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences needed to absorb the deferred tax assets at december  however  we believe our projection of revenue growth from the plan coupled with the elimination or reduction of various expenses and charges associated with this plan  should result in substantially higher pre tax earnings in future periods  which in turn should give rise to taxable income levels that are sufficient to absorb the deferred tax assets over a short time period

kansas city office expansion pursuant to the terms of an acquisition agreement entered into by certain company subsidiaries and midwest financial services corp

the privatewealth group s fee revenue increased to million  or  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  fee revenue increased despite pressures on asset values due to the growth in new business early in the year  prior to the significant market declines in the latter part of and the continued implementation of new  higher fee structures for certain client relationships 
net income for the privatewealth group decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  and down from million for the same period in the decrease in net income is attributable to higher operating costs  that included one time trust system conversion related costs

the holding company segment reported a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the same period in and a net loss of for the increase in the net loss year over year is primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of in junior subordinated debentures in may  million contingent convertible senior notes in and increased legal and audit fees at the holding company level due to the continued growth of the company

portfolio composition our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial  real estate which includes commercial real estate  construction and residential real estate and personal loans  with commercial loans representing of total loans outstanding at december  we seek to balance our loan portfolio among loan categories as well as by industry segment and as influenced by market and economic conditions 
we seek to maintain a diversified loan portfolio to minimize our exposure to any particular industry or any segment of the economy 
in early  we made a strategic decision to curtail any new loan production in the residential development sector and to allow a substantial portion of this portfolio to wind down as this type of lending is not a core component of our plan 
consistent with our emphasis on relationship banking  the majority of our loans are made to our core  multi relationship clients 
the clients usually maintain deposit relationships with us and may utilize  personally or through entities they control  other company banking services  such as treasury management  capital markets or privatewealth services 
we seek to reduce our credit risk through disciplined credit underwriting at the individual borrower level combined with the establishment and maintenance of loan portfolio sub limits by loan type  collateral and selected industries to promote loan portfolio diversification and active credit administration 
we do not engage in sub prime commercial or residential lending and do not securitize our loans for sale

the significant commercial loan growth reflects the inclusion of new middle market client loans booked by lenders hired under our plan 
the middle market lending focus of these lenders complemented the existing lenders book of business with the new lending relationships contributing to greater loan portfolio diversification 
the million  or  growth of commercial real estate loans was spread across all major property types with a greater geographic dispersion and reflects a larger average loan size for this category of credit

commercial loans as of december   commercial loans grew by billion  or  to billion compared to billion at december  the commercial loan growth was fueled by new middle market lending relationships added by the lenders hired under the plan 
an independent review and approval of potential new lending relationships by our credit administration  and also by our loan committee for larger dollar size transactions  allowed for selective growth 
the lenders hired under the plan are predominately experienced middle market lenders and include officers with lending expertise in certain specialized industries such as healthcare construction and engineering 
commercial loans outstanding at december  generated by these teams of specialist lenders totaled million and million  respectively 
we review our loan portfolio distribution by industry and set industry lending sub limits as appropriate 
loans secured by non residential owner occupied commercial real estate 
table of contents totaling million at december  and million at december  were included as commercial loans since the cash flow of the owner s business is the primary source of loan repayment 
our commercial loan portfolio is comprised of lines of credit to businesses for working capital needs  term loans for equipment and expansion  letters of credit and owner occupied commercial real estate loans 
unsecured loans are made to businesses when a guarantor  as a secondary source of repayment  has a significant ability to repay and a significant interest in the business entity 
commercial loans can contain risk factors unique to the business of each borrower 
in order to mitigate these risks  we seek to gain an understanding of the business of each borrower  place appropriate value on collateral taken and structure the loan properly to make sure that collateral values are maintained through the life of the loan 
appropriate documentation of commercial loans is also important to protect our interests 
our lines of credit typically are limited to a percentage of the value of the assets securing the line  and priced by a floating rate formula 
in general  lines of credit are reviewed annually and are supported by accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
depending on the risk profile of the borrower  we may require periodic aging of receivables  and inventory and equipment listings to verify the quality of the borrowing base prior to advancing funds 
our term loans are also typically secured by the assets of our clients businesses 
term loans typically have maturities between one to five years  with either floating or fixed rates of interest 
commercial borrowers are required to provide updated financial statements quarterly and personal financial statements at least annually 
letters of credit are an important product to many of our clients 
we issue standby or performance letters of credit  and can service the international needs of our clients through correspondent banks 
we use the same underwriting standards for letters of credit as we do for funded loans 
our commercial lending underwriting process includes an evaluation of the borrower s financial statements and projections with an emphasis on operating results  cash flow  liquidity and balance sheet proportions as well as the collateral to determine the level of creditworthiness of the borrower 
generally  these loans are secured by a first priority security interest in all the assets of the borrower and also include the support of a personal guarantee of one or more of the principals of the borrower 
while our loan policies have guidelines for advances on different types of collateral  we establish eligible asset values on a case by case basis for each borrower 
as we continue to grow our middle market commercial lending business  we will offer more traditional middle market commercial loan products that will require higher monitoring of our borrower s collateralized assets and may include lending that is nonrecourse 
commercial real estate loans commercial real estate loans at december  totaled billion  up million  or  from billion at december  the growth was aided by the infusion of new loans booked by lenders hired under the plan 
due to the middle market orientation of the new borrowers contrasted to the smaller entrepreneurial orientation of the existing private client borrowers  the average loan size has increased and borrower type has become more diversified 
although the geographic location of the commercial real estate collateral is significantly concentrated in the chicago metropolitan area  originations from our new business development offices in denver and minneapolis are contributing to an increased geographic diversification of the underlying collateral 
as a percentage of total loans  commercial real estate loans have decreased from at december  to at december   with the most pronounced percentage drop occurring during this is reflective of our strategy over the past several years to decrease the concentration of commercial real estate loans in our loan portfolio and further diversify by adding commercial loans 
the plan has accelerated this portfolio re alignment 
commercial real estate loan concentrations by collateral type are reviewed against established sub limits as part of our risk management program and adherence to regulatory agencies guidance 

table of contents our commercial real estate portfolio is comprised of loans secured by various types of collateral including family non owner occupied housing units located primarily in the banks target market areas  other non owner occupied multi family real estate  office buildings  warehouses  retail space  mixed use buildings  and vacant land  the bulk of which is held for long term investment or development 
refer to table for more detail on our commercial real estate and construction loans by collateral type 
risks inherent in real estate lending are related to the market value of the property taken as collateral  the underlying cash flows and documentation 
it is important to accurately assess property values through careful review of appraisals 
we mitigate these risks through review and understanding of the appraised value of the property  the ability of the cash flow generated from the collateral property to service debt  the significance of any outside income of the borrower or income from other properties owned by the borrowers  adhering to our loan documentation policies and the strength of guarantors  as applicable 
our real estate appraisal policy addresses selection of appraisers  appraisal standards  environmental issues and specific requirements for different types of properties  and has been approved by the banks credit policy committee 
construction loans construction loans at december  totaled million  up million or from million at december  construction loans for single family and multi family dwellings decreased as a result of lower residential construction volume and our strategic decision in early to wind down our existing residential development portfolio and de emphasize this type of lending 
during the same period  growth of non residential construction loans almost doubled  boosting overall construction loan volume and providing better loan diversification by type of construction project 
due to increased project complexity and its effect on completion risk associated with construction loans  in we hired dedicated construction lending specialists to monitor construction loan draws 
as with commercial real estate loans  we review our construction loan concentrations as part of our risk management program and adherence to regulatory agencies guidance 
our construction loan portfolio consists of single family residential properties  multi family properties  and commercial projects  and includes both investment properties and properties that will be owner occupied 
as construction lending has greater inherent risk  we closely monitor the status of each construction loan throughout its term 
typically  we require full investment of the borrower s equity in construction projects prior to injecting our funds 
generally  we do not allow borrowers to recoup their equity from the sale proceeds of finished product if applicable until we have recovered our funds on the overall project 
due to the inherent risks and the monitoring requirements our construction loans are often the highest yielding loans in our portfolio 
we seek to manage these risks by  among other things  ensuring that the collateral value of the property throughout the construction process does not fall below acceptable levels  ensuring that funds disbursed are within parameters set by the original construction budget  and properly documenting each construction draw 
although we have recently experienced an increase in the number of construction loans that are non performing  primarily residential development loans  due to our more stringent standards for underwriting and monitoring construction loans and the credit profile of our borrowers  we are comfortable with the risk associated with this portfolio and are committed to construction lending as an integral part of our lending program 
between december  and december   we have significantly decreased our concentration in vacant land and mixed use properties and modestly increased our concentration in office and retail properties

personal loans at december   personal loans totaled million  up million  or  from million at december  our personal loan portfolio consists largely of loans for investment asset acquisition and general liquidity purposes  including lines of credit 
due to our private client focus  which includes lending to entrepreneurs  some of these loans can be sizeable 
we have minimal automobile loans and no credit card loans 
loan concentrations loan concentrations are considered to exist when amounts are loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities  which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
at december   commercial real estate loans and construction loans comprised and of our total loan portfolio  respectively 
the distribution of the non owner occupied commercial real estate loan collateral by property type and by geographic location mitigates the risk posed by the commercial real estate loan concentration with the largest property categories being office buildings  land development and retail buildings  each comprising of total loans  respectively 
while there still is a geographic concentration of loans made to clients residing in the chicago metropolitan area and a concentration of non owner occupied commercial real estate collateral located in illinois  these concentrations are lessening due to the expanded national presence achieved through our plan 
with respect to our construction loan portfolio  the volume of construction loans for single and multi family dwellings at december  decreased both in dollar terms and as a percentage of total construction loans from december  reflecting the downturn in residential construction and our strategic decision to run off our residential development portfolio 
at december   residential and non residential construction loans comprised approximately and of the construction loan portfolio compared to and at december  the non residential construction loans are further diversified by project type and geographic location 
our commercial loan portfolio of billion at december  is well diversified with no evident industry concentrations in excess of of total loans 
in the addition of new commercial loans booked by the experienced middle market lenders hired under our plan enabled us to accelerate our strategy of improving loan portfolio diversification 
loans to residential real estate developers totaled million at december   or of total loans 
this portfolio is comprised of for sale housing construction loans of million  including mixed use loans of million  and land development loans for residential projects of million 
while this portfolio now comprises less than of total loans  the problems associated with it merit specific comment 
due to the cyclical downturn experienced in the residential real estate market that was further aggravated by the credit market disruptions in  many of our developer clients exhausted their resources as they were unable to move their inventory 
loan to value ratios that were originally within our underwriting guidelines now exceeded our limits as a result of declining property values and a significant percentage of our charge offs stemmed from this portfolio 
with respect to the december loan portfolio review  million of the million in charge offs during the fourth quarter pertained to this portfolio

we have established a system of internal controls to mitigate credit risk 
chief among the controls is the management loan committee process which presents selected credits based on amount and risk before a group of seasoned credit professionals which vet the loan at approval and then at appropriate intervals 
also in place to monitor and manage loan quality are standard lending and credit policies  underwriting criteria  and collateral safeguards 
we monitor and implement our formal credit policies and procedures and regularly evaluate trends  collectability  and collateral protection within the loan portfolio 
our policies and procedures are regularly reviewed and modified in order to manage risk as conditions change and new credit products are offered 
our credit administration policies include a comprehensive loan rating system 
this system allows for common reference across loan types and facilitates the identification of emerging problems in loan transactions 
our internal credit review function performs regular reviews of the lending groups to assess the accuracy of loan ratings and the adherence to credit policies 
exam results are communicated to senior lending and risk management executives as well specified board of director committees 
lending officers have the primary responsibility for monitoring their client relationships and effecting timely changes to loan ratings as events warrant 
we believe that any significant change in the overall quality of the loan portfolio will be reflected in the cumulative effect of changes to these loan ratings 
in addition  our senior lenders actively review those loans that call for more extensive monitoring and may warrant some degree of remediation 
these loans are reviewed quarterly by a committee of senior lending and risk management officers  including the chief executive officer and chief risk 
table of contents officer  which assesses and directs actions plans to minimize the risk of these loans 
more troubled loans are reviewed on a monthly basis for heightened oversight with such reviews including the participation of the chief executive and chief risk officer 
we also maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is supported by available and relevant information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships  as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified 
we evaluate the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses based on the combined total of the general  specific and unallocated reserve components 
our application of the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses resulted in an allowance for loan losses of million at december  providing coverage of total loans compared with million providing of total loans at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses from december  reflects management s judgment about the comprehensive risk of lending in our various markets as well as increased loan volume generated by the plan 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for probable and reasonably estimable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of december  during in response to the diverging geographic performance of our lending portfolio and the deteriorating economic environment we modified our allowance for loan loss methodology as of june  to include the use of amplification factors based on geographic performance characteristics and local economic conditions 
this resulted in a significant increase in loan loss reserve levels 
while the allowance for loan loss methodology required a lower reserve percentage on the more favorably risk rated loans booked under our plan  total volume of new loans booked necessitated sizeable provisions each quarter 
the magnitude and speed of the economic deterioration noted in the second half of triggered an intensive loan portfolio review and collateral revaluation during december which culminated in net loan charge offs totaling million during the fourth quarter versus million for all of the portfolio review included all residential real estate development loans and other underperforming assets 
there were many residential real estate development and land development loans where the outstanding loan balance was charged down to reduce the loan balance to what is believed to be a collateral realizable value with the remaining balance classified as impaired 
we have established a special governance function within the credit area to oversee the process of collecting on these charged down loans in order to maximize recoveries 
the december loan portfolio review also resulted in a sharply higher level of adversely rated loans from the prior year end despite the elevated level of charge offs 
while the application of quantifiable factors caused the allocated portion of the allowance for loan loss to rise throughout  the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan loss was also increased from december  to reflect the increased volatility in the current economic environment 
the need to replenish the allowance for loan loss to a level adequate to cover probable and reasonably estimable losses resulted in a loan loss provision of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year period 
we believe the near term economic environment will not materially improve and the actions taken  particularly during the fourth quarter  were designed to minimize balance sheet risk by recognizing losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
in addition to the allowance for loan losses  we maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments at a level we believe to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities 
the reserve is included in other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition and totaled  at december  the reserve is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the general allocated component of the allowance for loan losses 
net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other non interest expense in the consolidated statements of income

previously  the allowance for loan loss methodology incorporated the past five years of our actual loss experience and historical loss experience augmented by banking industry loss statistics in and  which were identified as two cyclical downturn years  as a basis for predicting inherent losses 
the historical loss basis was then adjusted for other factors that impacted the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  including factors prescribed by the fdic 
for the quarter and year ended december   we altered this approach since represented a significant cyclical downturn 
through our historical yearly loss had been minimal with the annual net loan loss experience ranging from a net recovery of to a net loss of for and we had looked to industry loss experience to supplement our loss experience 
while we continue to monitor the industry loss experience for fdic insured banks nationally and in illinois as well as for our defined peer group  the magnitude and speed of the economic deterioration noted in the last half of that triggered our losses in the fourth quarter and the lag in obtaining the fourth quarter and year end industry data has rendered the industry statistics less meaningful 
the updating of our loss migration analysis with the data combined with the mid modification of our allowance for loan loss methodology that included quantifiable geographic data and regional economic conditions  resulted in a higher overall reserve level for our company and a re allocation of reserves by loan type 
under our methodology  the allowance for loan losses is comprised of the following components general allocated component of the allowance the general allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses is based on loan type and loan risk rating distribution within each loan type 
we assign each of our loans a risk rating at the time of loan origination and either confirm or change the risk rating at the time of subsequent reviews  loan renewals or upon default 
the loss allocations are also based on a combination of loss rates  regional economical conditions and geographic portfolio performance 
the general allocated component of the allowance increased by million during  from million at december  to million at december  the magnitude of the dollar increase in the general allocated portion of the reserve reflects higher loan volumes generated by the plan 

table of contents specific component of the allowance for loans where management deems either the amount or the timing of the repayment to be significantly impaired  there are specific reserve allocations established 
the specific reserve is based on a loan s current value compared to the present value of its projected future cash flows  collateral value or market value  as is relevant for the particular loan pursuant to sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
at december   after taking into account million in net charge offs during the year  the specific component of the allowance decreased by million to  from million at december  unallocated components of the allowance the unallocated component of the allowance is based on management s review of other factors affecting the determination of probable losses inherent in the portfolio  which are not necessarily captured by the general allocation or specific reserve components of the allowance 
this portion of the reserve analysis involves the exercise of judgment and reflects consideration such as management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 
the unallocated component of the reserve was increased by million for  from million at december  to million at december  during we increased the unallocated component of our reserve due to our judgment that the general economic environment was deteriorating and business operating conditions were becoming increasingly volatile  which increases the likelihood of inherent losses in the portfolio at december  nonperforming assets nonperforming loans include loans past due days and still accruing interest  loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued and loans for which the terms have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest and principal due to a weakening of the borrower s financial condition 
nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and real estate that has been acquired primarily through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition

during in response to the weakening economic environment  we tightened our management of past due loans and other under performing loans resulting in a decrease in the level of accruing loans days past due 
beginning in mid  all loans days past due are automatically placed on non accrual status unless otherwise approved in writing by the chief risk officer or chief credit officer 
this change in policy had the effect of increasing the level of non accrual loans at december  relative to previous calendar year ends 
the level and composition of our nonperforming loans has changed over the past three years  reflecting primarily the acceleration of economic weakness and secondarily a tightening of our non accrual loan policy and past due loan management 

table of contents while the level of non accrual loans rose throughout  the most pronounced increase occurred during the fourth quarter after the december loan portfolio review 
the portfolio review included all residential development and land development loans along with all other underperforming assets 
the intent of the review was to identify inherent losses where cash flow and guarantor support indicated likely non performance and where losses from deteriorating asset values were evident 
as a result of the review  we recognized net charge offs of million for the fourth quarter and million for all of the outstanding loan balances of numerous residential real estate development and land development loans were charged down to reduce the balance to what is believed to be a collateral realizable value 
we utilized several independent third party firms to assist us in sizing charge off ranges for loans  especially on large vacant land tracks and those projects in remote areas or in early stages of development 
the catalyst for doing this was the further erosion of property values seen in the later months of and the lack of sales activity which rendered even fairly recent appraisals less meaningful 
all of the loans considered for the december portfolio review were deemed to be impaired and the post charge off balance of these loans aggregated million as compared to total non accrual loans of million at december  the net increase to non accrual loans resulting from the december loan portfolio review was million 
the increase in foreclosed real estate oreo to million at december  from million at december  and million at december   also reflects the deteriorating general economic conditions 
at december   oreo by property type was distributed as follows single family  vacant land intended for residential development  vacant land intended for commercial development  condominiums  mixed use  commercial and retail 
by geographic market  oreo was distributed as follows chicago  st 
louis  michigan and georgia 
the disproportionately high level of oreo in georgia is reflective of our lending concentration to residential builders and the over developed atlanta market 
over the course of we have seen many of our residential real estate developer clients exhaust their resources 
we continue to be actively working with our developer clients to determine the best solution to maximize value and have re aligned and augmented our loan work out in response to deteriorating credit trends in both this segment and overall 
for the year ended december   we expensed million associated with the management and disposition of oreo property compared to million in in future quarters  the migration of loans from performing to nonperforming and  in some cases  to oreo and finally to cash repayment will vary depending upon the adopted solution 
in addition to the amount of nonaccrual and delinquent loans over ninety days past due  we had million of loans that were currently performing  but for which we had some concern with the ability of the borrower to comply with existing loan repayment terms 
these loans continue to perform under existing terms and accrue interest 
we anticipate that a guarantee  additional collateral  or other planned action will result in the full repayment of debt 
at this time we do not expect losses on these loans  but a higher level of scrutiny is prudent under the circumstances 
our disclosure with respect to impaired loans is contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

total deposits of billion as of december  represented an increase of from billion as of december  client deposits  which represent total deposits less traditional brokered deposits and non client cdars  increased to billion compared to billion at december  during the year  as part of the plan we facilitated our deposit growth by aggressively pursuing deposits from existing and new clients  increasing institutional and municipal deposits  expanding our business dda account balances due to our enhanced treasury management services  and implementation of a cdars deposit program 
our non interest bearing dda accounts increased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this increase is significant because the non interest bearing nature of these business accounts improves our funding costs for the plan and reflects the success we have had in attracting new commercial banking clients 
the cdars deposit program is a deposit services arrangement that effectively achieves fdic deposit insurance for jumbo deposit relationships  which is an attractive feature to many of our middle market and private banking clients 
these deposits are classified as brokered deposits for regulatory deposit purposes  however  the source of theses deposits we classify as client cdars is our existing and new client relationships and are  therefore  not traditional brokered deposits 
we also participate in a non client cdars program that is more like a traditional brokered deposit program in that we have as client relationships with the underlying depositor 

table of contents as a result of our efforts in executing the plan in  we experienced significant increases in total deposits over prior year levels with such growth led by non interest bearing deposits increasing  money market accounts increasing and brokered deposits increasing 
we utilized brokered deposits as a source of funding for the substantial growth in our loan portfolio during the year 
brokered deposits were billion at december   up from million at december  our brokered deposits to total deposits ratio was at december  and at december  brokered deposits at december  include billion in cdars deposits  of which we consider million to be client related cdars 
as we attract new clients  loan volume tends to lead client deposit volume associated with those new relationships 
we anticipate continuing our reliance on traditional brokered deposits to fund a portion of this growth 
long term  as client deposits grow  we expect to reduce our reliance on traditional brokered deposits as a percentage of total deposits 
we have issued certain brokered deposits with call option provisions  which provide us with the opportunity to redeem the certificates of deposits on a specified date prior to the contractual maturity date 
public balances  denoting the funds held on account for municipalities and other public entities  are included as a part of our total deposits 
we enter into specific agreements with certain public customers to pledge collateral  primarily securities  in support of the balances on account 
they provide us with a more reliable  lower cost  short term funding source than what is available through other wholesale alternatives 
these relationships also provide numerous cross sell and business referral opportunities 
in  we had public funds on account totaling million  of which less than were collateralized with securities 
year to year changes in balances are influenced by the tax collection activities of the various municipalities as well as the general level of interest rates

table of contents management of capital stockholders equity increased to million at december   an increase of million from million of stockholders equity at december  due primarily to two capital raising transactions that occurred during the second quarter as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
on december   we sold million shares of common stock  and  shares of a newly created class of nonvoting convertible preferred stock in a private placement offering 
the convertible preferred shares have the same economic terms as our common stock in all material respects  except that the preferred shares have no voting rights 
we used the proceeds from the sale of the shares for working capital and general corporate purposes  including the support of the plan 
during the first quarter  gtcr golder rauner  llc  our largest institutional stockholder  indicated a willingness to convert its non voting preferred shares into voting common shares 
any share conversion is subject to appropriate regulatory approval 
the conversion  if it occurs  would improve our tangible common equity ratio by basis points to approximately 
on january   we sold  shares of a newly created class of senior preferred stock to the treasury as part of the tarp cpp program  resulting in aggregate net proceeds of million 
we also issued to the treasury a ten year warrant to purchase up to million shares of our common stock  or of the aggregate dollar amount of senior preferred shares purchased by the treasury  at an exercise price of per share 
with the receipt of the tarp proceeds in the first quarter  we believe we have significant regulatory capital to support our anticipated continued growth under the plan in the near future  and  therefore  believe we do not need to currently raise additional capital 
with the additional tarp capital infusion  we believe we can grow our loan portfolio at an annual rate of between billion and billion  and still remain well capitalized based on our total risk based capital ratio into the latter part of we will seek to raise additional capital when we believe market conditions are favorable to us and our stockholders  and will manage our growth based on our existing and anticipated capital availability 
while we understand the market s emphasis on our tangible common equity tce ratio  which is only one of a number of performance ratios we use internally to measure our results of operation and financial condition  we believe our tce ratio of approximately at year end is currently sufficient given the composition of our balance sheet and the proactive credit risk management actions we took in the fourth quarter of capital measurements a strong capital position relative to the capital adequacy rules that apply to us is crucial in maintaining investor confidence  accessing capital markets  and enabling us to take advantage of future profitable growth opportunities 
our capital and dividend policy requires that we maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory guidelines 
it serves as an internal discipline in analyzing business risks and internal growth opportunities and sets targeted levels of return on equity 
under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  we are subject to various capital requirements set and administered by the federal banking agencies 
these requirements specify minimum capital ratios  defined as tier and total capital as a percentage of assets and off balance sheet items that have been weighted according to broad risk categories and a leverage ratio calculated as tier capital as a percentage of adjusted average assets 
we have managed our capital ratios to consistently maintain such measurements in excess of the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb minimum levels considered to be well capitalized  which is the highest capital category established

in connection with restrictions on stock repurchases as part of the cpp  we terminated our repurchase program on february  the restrictions on repurchases will not affect our ability to repurchase shares in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans as such transactions are in the ordinary course and consistent with our past practice 
market and interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
we have used derivatives in past years as an interest rate risk management tool and may use such instruments in the future  however we currently do not have any such instruments on our consolidated balance sheet 
changes in market rates give us the opportunity to make changes to our investment security portfolio as part of the implementation of our asset liability management strategies 
our net interest margin decreased to during  as compared to at december  during  our interest earning asset yields declined more quickly than our costs on wholesale funds  short term borrowings and deposits due to the decline in short term libor rates and prime during the year 
approximately of the loan portfolio is indexed to the prime rate of interest  of the loan portfolio is indexed to libor  and another of the total loan portfolio  otherwise adjusts with other short term interest rates 
while in we have more actively managed our interest rate risk position through increased fixed rate investment securities  and shortened wholesale funding maturities as compared to  we do not foresee or expect any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
we will continue to consider the use of interest rate swaps in the future depending on changes in market rates of interest and our balance sheet structure to further mange our position 
liquidity risk management the objectives of liquidity risk management are to ensure that we can meet our cash flow requirements  capitalize on business opportunities in a timely and cost effective manner and satisfy regulatory guidelines for liquidity imposed by bank regulators 
liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet our clients needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in our business operations or unanticipated 
table of contents events 
liquidity is secured by managing the mix of items on the balance sheet and expanding potential sources of liquidity 
we manage liquidity at two levels at the holding company level and at the bank subsidiary level 
the management of liquidity at both levels is essential because the holding company and banking subsidiaries each have different funding needs and sources 
liquidity management is guided by policies formulated and monitored by our senior management and the banks asset liability committees  which take into account the marketability of assets  the sources and stability of funding market conditions  the level of unfunded commitments and potential future loan growth 
we also develop and maintain contingency funding plans  which evaluate our liquidity position under various operating circumstances and allow us to ensure that we would be able to operate through a period of stress when access to normal sources of funding is constrained 
the plans project funding requirements during a potential period of stress  specify and quantify sources of liquidity  outline actions and procedures for effectively managing through the problem period  and define roles and responsibilities 
the plans are reviewed and approved annually by the asset liability committee 
during  we applied for and received access to a line of credit from the federal reserve discount window 
as of december  the privatebank chicago had approximately billion in borrowing capacity available  and had none outstanding 
since year end  we have made routine use of the federal reserve discount window as a short term funding source in order to supplement higher costing brokered deposits 
our bank subsidiaries principal sources of funds are client deposits  wholesale market based borrowings and capital contributions by the company 
the bank subsidiaries also relied on large institutional deposits as a key funding source in our bank subsidiaries principal uses of funds include funding growth in the core asset portfolios  including loans  and to a lesser extent  our investment portfolio  which is used primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk 
the primary sources of funding for the holding company include dividends received from its bank subsidiaries  and proceeds from the issuance of senior  subordinated and convertible debt  as well as equity 
primary uses of funds for the parent company include repayment of maturing debt  share repurchases  dividends paid to stockholders  interest paid to our debt holders and subsidiary funding through capital and or debt 
our client deposits  the most stable source of liquidity due to the nature of long term relationships generally established with our clients  are available to provide long term liquidity for our bank subsidiaries 
at december   of our total assets were funded by client deposits  compared to at december  client deposits for purposes of this ratio are defined to include all deposits less traditional brokered deposits and non client cdars 
time deposits are included as client deposits since these deposits have historically not been volatile deposits for us 
while we first look toward internally generated deposits as a funding source  we continue to utilize wholesale funding sources  including brokered deposits  in order to enhance liquidity and to fund our loan growth 
in  we expect to continue to rely on brokered deposits as an alternative method of funding growth 
our asset liability management policy currently limits our use of brokered deposits excluding reciprocal cdars to levels no more than of total deposits  and brokered deposits to levels no more than of total deposits 
we do not expect these threshold limitations to limit our ability to implement our plan 
brokered deposits increased to of total deposits at december   compared to of total deposits at december  liquid assets refer to cash on hand  federal funds sold  as well as available for sale securities

at december   our total availability of overnight fed funds borrowings was million  of which we had million outstanding 
our total availability of overnight fed funds borrowings is not a committed line of credit  and is dependent upon lender availability 
in addition  we have a senior credit facility consisting of a million revolving credit line at the holding company and million in subordinated debt capacity at the privatebank chicago 
at december   we had drawn on each of the senior and subordinated debt facilities to the maximum amount 
we utilize these credit facilities from time to time for general business purposes 
during the third quarter of we entered into a million senior debt facility agreement with a group of lenders the bank group 
borrowings under the agreement at december  were considered eurodollar borrowings with interest charged based on three month libor plus 
at december  the interest rate was 
the credit facility matures on september   but may be prepaid at any time prior to that date without penalty 
the debt facility agreement provides for certain financial covenants 
at december  we were in compliance with all but three of the financial covenants maintaining an allowance for loan losses of at least of nonperforming assets  maintaining a ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets and other real estate owned no greater than  and maintaining a double leverage ratio no greater than 
we were not in compliance due to the unusually large credit quality management actions taken in the fourth quarter effective february   the bank group waived our compliance with such covenants as of december  and amended the facility agreement to  among other things  modify two of the three financial covenants and re price the eurodollar borrowings at libor plus in march  we issued million in principal amount of senior convertible notes 
the notes bear interest at the annual rate of  payable semi annually in arrears on march and september of each year beginning september  the notes will mature on march   unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or converted 
we may redeem or call all or a portion of the notes for cash on or after march   at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
before march   the notes are not redeemable or callable 
conversely  each noteholder has the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of its notes on specified dates at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the specified dates are march   june   september   december   march   march   march   and march  based on the coupon rate of the notes relative to market interest rates for long term bonds and the contacts some noteholders have made with us expressing their interest in redeeming their notes for cash  we expect many  if not all  of the noteholders will exercise their put right on march  and require us to repurchase their notes 
we believe we have adequate liquidity at the holding company level to meet this potential repurchase obligation 
impact of inflation our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry 
under these principles and practices  we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 

table of contents unlike many industrial companies  virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to our financial position and results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments based on information available as of the date of the financial statements that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions  and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
we have numerous accounting policies  of which the most significant are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that our accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses  goodwill and intangible assets  and income taxes are the accounting areas requiring subjective or complex judgments that are most important to our financial position and results of operations  and  as such  are considered to be critical accounting policies  as discussed below 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based on a review of available and relevant information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified 
our allowance for loan losses is assessed monthly to determine the appropriate level of the allowance 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is determined based on a variety of factors  including assessment of the credit risk of the loans in the portfolio  delinquent loans  impaired loans  evaluation of current economic conditions in the market area  actual charge offs and recoveries during the period  industry loss averages and historical loss experience 
the unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations  including management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 
management adjusts the allowance for loan losses by recording a provision for loan losses in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance at the level determined appropriate 
loans are charged off when deemed to be uncollectible by management 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was as of december   compared to at december  goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the purchase method of accounting 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack 
table of contents physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset  or liability 
we test goodwill at least annually for impairment or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
impairment losses on recorded goodwill  if any  will be recorded as operating expenses 
goodwill is pushed down to business segments at acquisition 
fair values of reporting units are determined using either market based valuation multiples for comparable businesses if available  or discounted cash flow analyses based on internal financial forecasts 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
no impairment was identified as a result of the testing performed during or identified intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over that life in a manner that reflects the estimated decline in the economic value of the identified intangible asset and are subject to impairment testing whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
all of the other intangible assets have finite lives which are amortized over varying periods not exceeding years and include core deposit premiums that use an accelerated method of amortization and client relationship intangibles and assembled workforce which are amortized on a straight line basis 
for additional information of goodwill by business segment  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
income taxes the determination of income tax expense or benefit  and the amounts of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on a complex analyses of many factors  including interpretation of federal and state income tax laws  current financial accounting standards  the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities temporary differences  assessments of the likelihood that the reversals of deferred deductible temporary differences will yield tax benefits and estimates of reserves required for tax uncertainties 
we are subject to the federal income tax laws of the united states  and the tax laws of the states and other jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we periodically undergo examination by various governmental taxing authorities 
such agencies may require that changes in the amount of tax expense be recognized when their interpretations of tax law differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions  new interpretations of existing law or positions by federal or state taxing authorities  will not result in tax liability amounts that differ from our current assessment of such amounts  the impact of which could be significant to future results 
temporary differences may give rise to deferred tax assets  which are recorded on our consolidated statements of financial condition as deferred tax assets 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods based on weighing both positive and negative evidence and establish a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets for which recovery is unlikely  based on a standard of more likely than not 
in making this assessment  we must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize these assets through a the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  b future taxable income  c the possible application of future tax planning strategies  and d carryback to taxable income in prior years 
we have not established a valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets at december  however  there is no guarantee that the tax benefits associated with these deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
we have concluded  as of december   that it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will be realized 
in the preparation of income tax returns  tax positions are taken based on interpretation of federal and state income tax laws for which the outcome of such positions may not be certain 
we periodically 
table of contents review and evaluate the status of uncertain tax positions and may establish tax reserves for estimates of amounts that may ultimately be due or owed including interest 
these estimates may change from time to time based on our evaluation of developments subsequent to the filing of the income tax return  such as tax authority audits  court decisions or other tax law interpretations 
there can be no assurance that any tax reserves will be sufficient to cover tax liabilities that may ultimately be determined to be owed 
we had no tax reserves established relating to uncertain tax positions at december  for additional discussion of income taxes  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a continuing part of our financial strategy  we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income 
this effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk  credit risk  liquidity risk and maintenance of yield 
our asset liability management policy is established by the business risk committee of our board of directors and is monitored by management 
our asset liability management policy sets standards within which we are expected to operate 
these standards include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations  liquidity  loan limits as a percentage of funding sources  exposure to correspondent banks and brokers  and reliance on non core deposits 
the policy also states our reporting requirements to our board of directors 
the investment policy complements the asset liability management policy by establishing criteria by which we may purchase securities 
these criteria include approved types of securities  brokerage sources  terms of investment  quality standards  and diversification 
one way to estimate the potential impact of interest rate changes on our income statement is a gap analysis 
the gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to re pricing in specified time periods 
during any given time period  if the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of rate sensitive assets  a company would generally be considered negatively gapped and would benefit from falling rates over that period of time 
conversely  a positively gapped company would generally benefit from rising rates 
we have structured our assets and liabilities to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment 
we manage our gap position at the one year horizon 
depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over the short and long term  we generally operate within guidelines set by our asset liability management policy and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
there are other factors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our consolidated income statement

table of contents year ended december  over days days years years total interest earnings assets fed funds sold securities fhlb stock net loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits money market accounts brokered deposits time deposits borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities cumulative rate sensitive assets rsa rate sensitive liabilities rsl gap gap rsa rsl rsa rsl rsa to total assets rsl to total assets gap to total assets gap to total rsa our primary way of estimating the potential impact of interest rate changes on our income statement is through the use of a simulation model based on our interest earning asset and interest bearing liability portfolios  assuming the size of these portfolios remains constant throughout the twelve month measurement period 
the simulation assumes that assets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis 
assets and liabilities then re price based on current terms and remain at that interest rate through the end of the measurement period 
the model attempts to illustrate the potential change in net interest income if the foregoing occurred 
the following table shows the estimated impact of an immediate change in interest rates as of december  and december  analysis of net interest income sensitivity immediate change in rates dollars in thousands december  dollar change percent change december  dollar change percent change 
table of contents the estimated impact to our net interest income over a one year period is reflected in dollar terms and percentage change 
as an example  this table shows that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points on december   net interest income would increase by million or over a one year period  as compared to a net interest income increase of million or if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift of basis points at december  changes in the effect on net interest income at december   compared to december  are due to the timing and nature of the re pricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within the one year time frame 
while the percent of net interest income is relatively consistent across the rate scenarios  the absolute dollar impact has increased in each scenario due to increases in our interest earning asset and interest bearing liability portfolios 
during  the growth in our fixed rate bond portfolio offset some of the interest rate exposure resulting from the strong floating rate loan growth 
to further match the re pricing characteristics of our floating rate loan portfolio  management continued to focus on short term or floating rate wholesale funding including brokered deposits  repurchase agreements  fhlb advances and federal funds purchased 
as the absolute level of short term rates has dropped during  more of our loans are approaching or hitting their floors  which has the result of moderating further rate sensitivity in falling rates 
the preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  changes in deposit levels  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change 
we continue to monitor our gap and rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates 
we have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets  purchase or sell investment securities  or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk
