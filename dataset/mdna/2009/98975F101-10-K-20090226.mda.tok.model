industry background until the mid s  video images and audio soundtracks were transmitted  edited and stored almost exclusively using analog formats 
since then  advances in technology have allowed audio and video to be processed and stored in digital form 
unlike analog formats  which are inherently unstable and difficult to edit and enhance  digital formats permit the manipulation of audio and video signals through digital signal processing and offer a number of fundamental advantages over analog technologies 
through complex digital signal 
table of contents processing operations  digital audio and video signals may be compressed  providing significant storage and transmission efficiencies 
they also may be filtered  allowing for noise reduction  and they may be transmitted and reproduced without perceptible image or sound degradation 
digital formats provide users with additional benefits  including higher quality audio and video  random access to data and superior editing capabilities 
enhanced security features such as protection against unauthorized copying and controlled and secure access also encourage content owners to release their content in digital forms 
one of the most significant barriers to the widespread adoption of digital technology had been the huge amount of data required to represent images and sounds in a digital format  making cost effective storage or transmission impractical 
through digital compression techniques  a substantial number of the redundancies inherent in audio and video data can be identified and eliminated  significantly reducing the overall amount of data which needs to be retained 
compression techniques introduced in the early s allowed a two hour movie to be compressed and stored on only two video cds with video resolution comparable to that of a standard vhs tape 
more recent techniques allow the storage of a full length movie of more than three hours on a single dvd  with substantially improved audio and video quality and the incorporation of additional data  such as additional languages  scenes and director and actor commentary 
even more recently  further advancements in compression technology now allow  for example  a complete high definition movie to be stored in the same space 
additionally  digital compression of video data allows previously unmanageable amounts of data to be stored in the memory of a disk drive  thereby permitting the data to be accessed and edited easily 
it also allows for easier transmission of sharper resolution pictures through a standard definition or high definition television or set top box 
digital audio compression allows efficient storage and delivery of multi channel audio  making possible high quality special effects such as multi channel surround sound  virtual surround sound and wireless audio delivery via two speakers or headphones 
in the field of still photography  digital compression allows hundreds or even thousands of digital pictures to be stored on a single memory card  depending on the resolution desired 
to drive the implementation and speed the adoption of products based on digital formats  industry participants organized committees to define international compression standards 
the principal standards in use today include the following the joint photographic experts group  or jpeg  standard for the high quality compression of still images and the real time  low cost compression and decompression of moving images  the mpeg standard  adopted by the moving pictures experts group  or mpeg  for the compression of both audio and video data at the high compression ratios necessary for the limited storage capacity of the cd rom format  the mpeg standard  subsequently adopted by the motion pictures experts group  for the compression of both audio and video data  designed to provide improved quality in broadcast and video playback applications  the mpeg standard  which is an extension of mpeg and mpeg that provides the ability to view  access and manipulate objects rather than pixels  which is especially significant in video streaming  digital television  mobile multimedia and video game applications 
mpeg part standard  also known as advanced video codec avc or h  is an addition to the mpeg standard  offering significantly improved compression efficiencies  xvid  divx and mp file formats  which are based on the mpeg standard  are used encoding high quality digital video and audio at low bit rates 
these files can be viewed on the pc with a software player  on select dvd players and portable media  windows media  microsoft s standard digital media software platform for developing digital media products and services  and dolby digital  developed by dolby laboratories  an industry standard for the compression of audio for use in multi channel digital surround sound systems 

table of contents these industry standards have enabled the growth in the following digital multimedia markets dvd players and recorders dvd players and recorders primarily use mpeg video compression and dolby digital audio technology to provide significantly higher quality playback or recording than is possible with vcr or video cd technology 
standard definition and high definition televisions and set top boxes digital televisions receive digital content and process it to display a picture which has far greater resolution and sharper  more clearly defined images than televisions based on the older analog technology 
standard definition televisions generally contain lines with pixels per line 
high definition television  or hdtv  sets contain to pixels per line and up to lines 
the aspect ratio of standard definition sets is  compared to for hdtv 
the lines may be displayed using different techniques  often referred to as interlacing or alternatively progressive scan 
the capability to receive and process digital television signals can be contained in a set top box  which then drives a television that is capable of displaying digital content 
alternatively  this functionality can be integrated into a digital television that does not require a set top box 
digital content is broadcast via satellite  cable networks or over the air terrestrial broadcast in multiple regions throughout the world 
mobile products digital cameras use jpeg compression technology to capture high resolution still images that can be viewed  edited and stored on a computer system  on a recordable dvd  and or transmitted over telephone lines and computer networks 
some digital cameras are capable of capturing and playing back quality video  using the mpeg algorithm 
products and markets are developed based on established compression standards and additional compression technologies such as meridian lossless pcm  or mlp  a newer standard for dvd audio  super audio  or sacd  microsoft windows media audio  or wma  advanced audio codec aac used in conjunction with the mpeg video standard and mp  a compression standard for the download of audio recordings from the internet 
these established and emerging compression standards specify data formats which enable products from different vendors to interact and permit the capture  transmission  storage and display of audio and video data in digital format 
these standards do not specify the compression methodologies to be employed or additional functionality that may be used to enhance or manipulate digital signals 
these standards  therefore  do not determine image or sound quality or compression efficiency 
for example  data compression may comply with relevant standards despite being poorly processed and containing artifacts that result in image degradation in video applications or poor sound quality in audio applications 
as a result  there can be significant differences in overall image or sound quality between two solutions based on the same standard 
therefore  integrated circuit manufacturers can differentiate their products on the basis of the quality of their compression solution 
historically  as system vendors sought compression solutions  the cost  complexity and time required to compress and decompress data imposed significant limitations on the use of digital compression 
over the last several years  as cost effective compression solutions have emerged  product manufacturers have increasingly sought to design and market lower cost digital audio and video systems and products to address an increasing number of high volume consumer applications 
in addition  product manufacturers are facing competitive pressure to introduce their products more rapidly 
to address these issues  oems continually seek to integrate more and more functions on individual chips in order to reduce their costs  time to market and power consumption 
they also seek solutions that can easily be integrated into their commercial and consumer products 
the challenge to manufacturers of compression integrated circuits is  therefore  to provide product manufacturers with high quality  cost effective  standards based solutions that enable flexible control  image enhancement  audio effects and other functions in addition to high quality compression solutions 
we provide feature rich  cost effective  standards based solutions for a broad range of digital video  audio and imaging applications 
we were a pioneer in the development of high performance digital signal processor 
table of contents dsp products  and have developed expertise in integrated mixed signal circuit design  mathematical algorithms and software development  as well as proprietary digital signal processing  and video and audio compression technologies 
we apply our multi disciplinary expertise and proprietary technologies to the development of fully integrated solutions for high growth multimedia markets 
the key elements of our solutions include standards plus methodology we leverage our multi disciplinary expertise and proprietary digital signal processing and compression technologies to develop what we refer to as standards plus solutions 
we enable oems to improve image and sound quality and deliver superior products to end users by adding more features around compression standards  such as more efficient use of memory  processing and communication resources  as well as audio and image enhancement algorithms 
we also provide oems the ability to include oem programmable effects and features  as well as variable compression ratios for video 
these standards plus features allow our customers to differentiate their products from those of their competitors 
expandable and programmable architectures we design our integrated circuits to enable easy adaptation for a broad range of specific applications 
we can vary the architecture of our chips by adding or deleting modules  and we can also modify the software embedded in the chips themselves to address specific applications 
we also license ready to manufacture cores building blocks of integrated circuits that can be integrated into our customers chips 
combined with the enhanced functionality of our standards plus technology  our expandable and programmable architecture facilitates product design  upgrades and customization  substantially accelerating our customers time to market with differentiated products 
integrated system solutions we help our customers meet their total system requirements by providing integrated products that combine hardware and software to address required system functions and features on a single integrated circuit or chip set  reducing the number of integrated circuits  and in some cases providing a complete solution on a single chip 
as a result  our customers total system cost is reduced and they can concentrate on differentiating their products from those of their competitors 
for example  our coach ic includes most of the electronics of a digital camera on a single chip 
cost effective products we focus on reducing the size  power requirements and number of integrated circuits necessary to perform required system functions  including compression 
this reduces our customers manufacturing costs for products which incorporate our integrated circuits  and also reduces the costs of operating those products so that our products can be used in a broader range of high volume applications 
the modular nature of our architecture reduces our new product development costs  and enables our design engineers to meet our customers new product specifications and cost parameters 
near production ready system reference designs we provide our customers with a broad range of engineering reference boards and products complete with device driver software  embedded software and detailed schematics 
these products substantially shorten our customers product design time

extend technological leadership our years of experience in the fields of digital signal processing  integrated circuit design  algorithms and software development have enabled us to become a leader in the development of digital audio  video  and imaging solutions 
using our multi disciplinary expertise  we have developed new technologies for compression of digital audio  video and imaging formats 
we acquired important technologies for extending our capabilities into the growing multimedia mobile phone market and the global high definition television market 
we intend to continue to invest in research and development  and to evaluate opportunities to acquire additional technologies when needed to maintain and extend our technological leadership 
expand strategic partnerships we work closely in the product development process with leading manufacturers of products that incorporate our integrated circuits 
we also work closely with key customers and provide them early access to our technologies 
potential products are designed to meet customer driven product requirements defined by us with our partners providing technological input and  in selected cases  a portion of the development funding 
this strategy has enabled us to develop products with financial and other assistance while retaining ownership of the technology and ensuring an established customer for the product once development is completed 
in some cases  our strategic partners also provide sales and marketing support 
we have also established long term relationships with strategic partners that provide manufacturing capacity and we continually seek to develop additional strategic relationships with manufacturers 
markets and applications our products are currently used in a variety of consumer electronic devices  including the following consumer video playback systems red laser dvd players primarily use mpeg video compression and dolby digital or similar audio technology to provide significantly higher quality playback than earlier generation products such as vcrs  video cd or super video cd players 
digital television the digital television market represents the most significant technological shift in the consumer electronics market since color televisions were introduced in the late s 
today  digital content providers broadcast programming via satellite  cable or terrestrial over the air networks 
the mix of broadcast networks varies by geographic region 
for example  most digital television content in japan and korea is broadcast via terrestrial networks  while cable networks currently predominate in the united states 
satellite networks offer an alternative source of content to consumers and are continuing to grow in various regions such as india 
each geographic market is subject to regulations that require compliance with different governmental standards applicable to broadcast technology and content format 
in each region  individual broadcasters also have developed their own proprietary standards for content  security and conditional access 
this market requires television products  set top boxes  personal video recorders and other digital consumer appliances to include sophisticated integrated circuits and embedded software that address the emerging requirements of multiple broadcast networks throughout the world 
the requirement by the us federal communications commission  or fcc  that all new televisions contain a built in digital receiver  has accelerated the growth of the digital television market in the us 
table of contents mobile products digital cameras enable consumers to capture high resolution images  view  edit and store them on a computer system and transmit over telephone lines and computer networks 
high quality copies of these images can be printed using color printers 
digital cameras have added audio video capture and compression capabilities enabling them to function as digital video camcorders 
digital cameras can be connected directly to a pc for downloading of pictures or movies and to a television for display 
many mobile phones now incorporate digital still camera and camcorder functionality 
photos and video clip files can be immediately sent to another mobile phone or pc via email  downloaded to a printer or pc for printing or storing via wired or wireless technology 
with the spread of new technology and decreased manufacturing costs  mobile phones are including high resolution digital camera capabilities at increasingly lower price points 
digital imaging print products the home and office market for printers is shifting to multi function devices that print  copy  scan and fax 
in the enterprise and business segments the use of color  as opposed to monochrome  laser printers and copiers is now commonplace 
the market for embedded software for page description languages  or pdls  is more mature than other areas of the imaging market 
it is characterized by a small number of suppliers selling to very large oem customers for print devices designed to be connected to a network  typically in an enterprise 
the pdl enables printers to receive a file from a pc and translate it into a set of instructions that the printer can understand and lay down on paper 
in general  applications are designed to send jobs to printers using one or all of a number of protocols or language families 
print control language  or pcl  originated as a hewlett packard developed protocol for page printers and has become an industry standard in office environments 
both pcl and pcl xl  or pcl  are supported in office printers today 
the application may also use the postscript language originally developed by adobe  which tends to be focused more on graphic arts and apple operating system environments 
more recently  printers have also offered support for portable digital document formats that are designed to be widely viewed and shared  such as pdf  originally developed by adobe 
xml paper specification  or xps  a new format  introduced by microsoft in windows vista  is also being deployed as a format in printers

customers our customers consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers oems  original design manufacturers odms  and resellers in both domestic and international markets 
because we leverage our technologies across different markets  certain of our integrated circuits may be incorporated into equipment used in several markets 
odms provide design and or manufacturing services to branded and private label resellers and oems 
our sales and marketing teams work closely with our customers to define product features  performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet the needs of our customers 
we also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing  testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products in order to assist in optimizing product compatibility 
we believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers time to market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products 
in three customers accounted for  and of our total revenues  respectively 
research and development we believe that our future success depends on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop new products that maintain technological competitiveness and compliance with new standards in rapidly evolving consumer oriented digital audio and video markets 
we attempt to leverage our expertise in the fields of digital signal processing  integrated circuit design  algorithms and software development to maintain our position as a leader in the development of digital audio  video and imaging solutions 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our resources to maintaining and upgrading our products to reduce integrated circuit cost  feature size  power consumption and the number of integrated circuits required to perform compression and other functions necessary for the evolving digital audio  video and imaging application markets 
in addition  we seek to design integrated circuits and cores  as well as near production ready reference designs which reduce the time needed by manufacturers to integrate our ics into their own products 
we have historically generated a portion of our revenues from development contracts with our strategic partners 
these development contracts provide that we will receive payments upon reaching certain development milestones and that we will retain ownership of the intellectual property developed 
development contracts have enabled us to fund portions of our product development efforts  to respond to the feature requirements of our customers  to accelerate the incorporation of our products into our customers products and to accelerate the time to market of our customers products 
we anticipate  however  that in the future  development contracts with strategic partners will fund a smaller portion of our development efforts than in the past 
we are a party to research and development agreements with the chief scientist in israel s ministry of industry and trade and the israel united states bi national industrial research and development foundation 
these organizations fund up to of incurred costs for approved projects up to contract maximums 
the agreements require us to use our best efforts to achieve specified results and to pay royalties at rates of to of resulting product sales and up to of resulting license revenues  up to a maximum of to of the total funding received 
reported research and development expenses are net of these grants  which fluctuate from period to period 
the amounts received in and were immaterial 
there were no grant receipts in the terms of israeli government funding include restrictions on the location of research and development activities  and the terms of the grants from the chief scientist prohibit the transfer of technology developed pursuant to these grants to any person without the prior written consent of the chief scientist 

table of contents sales and marketing our sales and marketing strategy is to focus on providing solutions to manufacturers seeking to design audio  video and imaging products for existing and emerging high volume consumer applications 
in cooperation with leading manufacturers of audio  video and imaging equipment in the commercial and consumer markets  we attempt to identify market segments which have the potential for substantial growth 
to implement our strategy  we have established a worldwide direct sales force in offices located near our key customers and strategic partners  and a worldwide network of independent sales representatives and resellers 
in some cases  our strategic partners also provide sales and marketing support 
our sales are generally made pursuant to purchase orders received between one and six months prior to the scheduled delivery date 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales staff  field application engineers  and customer service staff located in the united states and internationally 
our united states sales staff is primarily responsible for sales in north america  europe and south america 
sales management and sales operations staff also reside in the united states 
our sales and field application engineers in china  japan  korea and taiwan are responsible for marketing and technical support in their respective regions 
in addition  we sell our products indirectly through selected resellers and commissioned sales representatives 
to date  we have not experienced material product returns or warranty expense 
we have offices in shenzhen  china as part of our effort to capture a leadership position in the chinese digital audio and video markets and offices in taipei and hsinchu  taiwan in an effort to better address the video  imaging and digital camera market 
in addition  we operate sales support offices in hong kong  india  korea and taiwan that provide sales  applications and customer support 
we distribute our products in japan primarily through resellers 
we operate an office in tokyo to help promote our products in japan  to assist with the marketing of products not sold through resellers  such as integrated circuit cores and certain digital camera  digital video  digital television  and imaging products  and to provide applications support to some of our customers 
backlog sales of our products are made pursuant to firm purchase orders 
however  sometimes we allow customers to cancel or reschedule deliveries 
in addition  purchase orders are subject to price renegotiations and to changes in quantities of products ordered as a result of changes in customers requirements and manufacturing availability 
our ability to order products can carry lead times of between four and sixteen weeks  however  most of our business is characterized by short lead times and quick delivery schedules 
as a result of these factors  we do not believe that backlog at any given time is a meaningful indicator of future sales 
manufacturing we contract our wafer fabrication  assembly and testing to independent foundries and contractors  which enables us to focus on our design strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing facilities 
our engineers work closely with our foundry partners and subcontractors to increase yields  lower manufacturing costs and assure quality 
most of our devices are currently fabricated using standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor process technology with micron to micron feature sizes 
our primary foundry is taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  which has manufactured integrated circuits for us since tsmc and tower semiconductor ltd 
are currently manufacturing our dvd  dtv  imaging and mobile products 
lsi corporation is providing turn key manufacturing for one high end laser printer product 
our independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design 
most of our semiconductor products are currently being assembled by one of two independent contractors and tested by those contractors or other independent contractors 
our primary services company for assembly and testing is advanced semiconductor engineering inc 
table of contents we currently purchase products from all of our foundries under individually negotiated purchase orders 
we do not currently have a long term supply contract with tsmc  and therefore tsmc is not obligated to manufacture products for us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
competition our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater finance  manufacturing  technology  marketing and distribution resources than we have 
some of these competitors also have broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we do 
some of our principal competitors maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from capacity  cost and technical advantages 
our principal competitors in the integrated audio and video devices for dvd applications include mediatek inc and sunplus technology co 
ltd 
in the markets for digital cameras  our principal competitors are in house solutions developed and used by major japanese oems  as well as products sold by ambarella  fujitsu  mediatek inc  novatech  sunplus and texas instruments  inc in the market for multimedia acceleration for mobile phones  our principal competitors include amd  broadcom corp  corelogic  mtekvision co 
ltd  nvidia and telechips inc our principal competitors for digital semiconductor devices in the digital television market include broadcom corp  m star  mediatek inc and st microelectronics 
others who also participate in this market are micronas  nxp and trident microsystems  inc competitors in the printer and multifunction peripheral space include adobe  conexant systems  inc  global graphics  marvell semiconductor  inc 
and in house captive suppliers 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for high performance audio  video and imaging technology depends on a number of factors  including the following quality  performance  features and price of our products  the timing and success of new product introductions by zoran  our customers and our competitors  the emergence of new industry standards  ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity  the number and nature of our competitors in a given market  and general market and economic conditions 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  declining average unit selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with solutions which may be less costly or provide higher performance or more desirable features than our products 
historically  average unit selling prices asps in the semiconductor industry in general  and for our products in particular  have decreased over the life of a particular product 
we expect that the asps of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures 
in order to offset expected declines in the asps of our products  we seek to continually reduce the cost of our products and continue to integrate additional functions into our ics 
we intend to accomplish this by implementing design changes that integrate additional functionality  lower the cost of manufacturing  assembly and testing  by negotiating reduced charges at our foundries as  and if  volumes increase  and by successfully managing our manufacturing and subcontracting relationships 
since we do not operate our own manufacturing  assembly or testing facilities  we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities 
if we fail to introduce lower cost versions of our products in a timely manner or to successfully manage our manufacturing  assembly and testing relationships  our business would be harmed 

table of contents proprietary rights and licenses our ability to compete successfully is dependent in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and information 
although we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and licensing arrangements to protect some of our intellectual property  we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel and the success of our ongoing product development efforts are more important in maintaining our competitive position 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  resellers  customers and potential customers and limit access to our proprietary information 
we currently hold issued patents worldwide  and have additional patent applications pending 
our intellectual property rights  if challenged  may not be upheld as valid  may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology  or may not prevent the development of competitive products 
additionally  we may not be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property protection in the future 
in particular  the existence of several consortiums or standards bodies that license patents relating to various standards for consumer electronics and digital technology have created uncertainty with respect to the use and enforceability of patents implementing those standards 
furthermore  the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and  thus  make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
we or our customers from time to time are notified of claims that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
we have been subject to intellectual property claims and litigation in the past 
see item legal proceedings 
we may be subject to additional claims and litigation in the future 
in particular  given the uncertainty discussed above regarding patents relating to the consumer electronics or digital technology standards  it is difficult for us to assess the possibility that our activities in these fields may give rise to future patent infringement claims 
litigation by or against us relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
licenses may not be offered on fair or reasonable terms or the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us 
if we fail to obtain a license from a third party for technology that it uses  we could incur substantial liabilities and be forced to suspend the manufacture of products  or the use by our foundries of certain processes 
we have non exclusive licenses from various third parties 
some of the licenses are for technologies that are required to develop our products while others allow us to sell our products enabled with the third parties respective technologies 
the majority of these agreements do not require us to pay royalties 
under most of our agreements  we may sell such third party enabled products only to customers who are licensees of such third parties 
we rely on our customers to enter into license agreements directly with the third parties pursuant to which they pay royalties and or license fees 
the failure or refusal of potential customers to enter into license agreement with such third parties in the future could harm our sales 
employees as of december   we had  employees  including employees primarily involved in research and development activities  in marketing and sales  in finance  human resources  information systems  legal and administration  and in manufacturing control and quality assurance 
we had employees based in israel  primarily involved in engineering and research and development  employees at our facility in sunnyvale  california and employees at our facility in burlington massachusetts 
we have employees in our china office 
other employees are located in our international offices in canada  england  france  india  japan  korea and taiwan 
we believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled  engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe that our employee relations are good 

table of contents item a risk factors our future business  operating results and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
our annual revenues and operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors  which may result in volatility or a decline in the prices of our common stock 
our historical operating results have varied significantly from period to period due to a number of factors  including fluctuation in demand for our products including reduced demand resulting from economic slowdowns and general business conditions  the timing of new product introductions or enhancements by us and our competitors  the level of market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and our customers products  the timing or cancellation of large customer orders  the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products  pricing policy changes by us and by our competitors and suppliers  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the availability of development funding and the timing of development revenue  changes in the mix of products sold  seasonality in demand for our products  increased competition in product lines  and competitive pricing pressures  and the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for products incorporating our integrated circuits and embedded software 
we expect that our operating results will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of these factors and a variety of other factors  including the cost and availability of adequate foundry capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in or the emergence of new industry standards  failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements  the loss or gain of important customers  product obsolescence  and the amount of research and development expenses associated with new product introductions 
our operating results could also be harmed by economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas where we or our customers do business  financial instability as a result of problems with mortgage related securities  liquidity of financial institutions  and credit market problems  terrorism and international conflicts or other crises  
table of contents other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders  changes in governmental regulations that could affect our products  a downturn in the markets for our customers products  particularly the consumer electronics market  disruption in commercial activities associated with heightened security concerns affecting international travel and commerce  reduced demand for consumer electronic products due to an economic slowdown  an inability to hold our auction rate securities for a sufficient time to allow the market activity to recover  tightened immigration controls that may adversely affect the residence status of key non us managers and technical employees in our non us facilities or our ability to hire new non us employees in such facilities  or further worsening or expansion of armed conflict in the middle east which could adversely affect our operations in israel 
these factors are difficult or impossible to forecast 
we place orders with independent foundries several months in advance of the scheduled delivery date  often in advance of receiving non cancelable orders from our customers 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for their products 
if anticipated shipments in any quarter are canceled or do not occur as quickly as expected  or if we fail to foresee a technology change that could render a product obsolete  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high 
if anticipated license revenues in any quarter are canceled or do not occur  gross margins may be reduced 
a significant portion of our expenses are relatively fixed  and the timing of increases in expenses is based in large part on our forecast of future revenues 
as a result  if revenues do not meet our expectations  we may be unable to quickly adjust expenses to levels appropriate to actual revenues  which could harm our operating results 
our customers experience fluctuating product cycles and seasonality  which causes their sales to fluctuate 
because the markets that our customers serve are characterized by numerous new product introductions and rapid product enhancements  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
during the final production of a mature product  our customers typically exhaust their existing inventories of our products 
consequently  orders for our products may decline in those circumstances  even if the products are incorporated into both mature products and replacement products 
a delay in a customer s transition to commercial production of a replacement product would delay our ability to recover the lost sales from the discontinuation of the related mature product 
our customers also experience significant seasonality in the sales of their consumer products  which affects their orders of our products 
typically  the second half of the calendar year represents a disproportionate percentage of sales for our customers due to the holiday shopping period for consumer electronics products  and therefore  a disproportionate percentage of our sales 
we expect these seasonal sales fluctuations to continue for the foreseeable future and an economic slowdown could increase the seasonal decline in sales that we typically see in the first half of the calendar year 
our ability to match production mix with the product mix needed to fill current orders and orders to be delivered in the given quarter may affect our ability to meet that quarter s revenue forecast 
in addition  when responding to customers requests for shorter shipment lead times  we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers demands 
these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions 
if we inaccurately forecast customer demand  we may hold inadequate  excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents the worldwide economic downturn and other adverse economic factors would be likely to reduce our sales and revenues  increase our expenses and hurt our profitability  results of operations and financial condition 
the current worldwide economic downturn has reduced and is likely to further reduce consumer spending on products made by our customers 
other factors  such as unemployment levels  inflation  deflation  fuel and energy costs  consumer debt levels  interest rates and tax rates  may also reduce overall consumer spending or shift consumer spending to products other than those made by our customers 
reduced sales by our customers could hurt our business by reducing demand for our products 
moreover  if customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing financing  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us 
lower net sales of our products and reduced payment capacity of our customers would reduce our immediate and future revenues 
in addition  our expenses could rise due to  among others  fluctuations of the value of united states dollar  changes in interest and tax rates  decreased inventory turnover  increases in vendor prices  and reduced vendor output 
such reduction of our revenues and increase of our expenses would hurt our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes  and some of those estimates are based on our forecasts of future results 
the current volatility in the worldwide economy increases the risk that our actual results will differ materially from our forecasts  requiring adjustments in future filings 
trends in global credit markets could result in insolvency of our key suppliers or customers  and customer inability to finance purchases of our products 
furthermore  the credit market crisis including uncertainties with respect to financial institutions and the global capital markets and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the united states and other parts of the world may adversely affect our customers and suppliers 
as a result of these conditions  our customers may experience cash flow problems and may modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase our products 
if our customers are unable to finance purchases of our products  our sales will be adversely affected 
similarly  current economic and credit conditions may cause our suppliers to increase their prices or reduce their output  which could increase our expenses or impair our sales 
moreover  if one of our key suppliers were to become insolvent  we may not be able to find a suitable substitute in a timely manner and our cost of production may increase 
if economic and credit conditions in the united states and other key markets deteriorate further or do not show improvement  our business and operating results may be adversely affected 
our products are characterized by average selling prices that typically decline over relatively short time periods  if we are unable to reduce our costs or introduce new products with higher average selling prices  our financial results will suffer 
average selling prices for our products typically decline over relatively short time periods  while many of our manufacturing costs are fixed 
when our average selling prices decline  our revenues decline unless we are able to sell more units and our gross margins decline unless we are able to reduce our manufacturing costs by a commensurate amount 
our operating results suffer when gross margins decline 
we have experienced these problems  and we expect to continue to experience them in the future  although we cannot predict when they may occur or how severe they will be 
our operating results may be harmed by cyclical and volatile conditions in the markets we address 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we operate in the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical and from time to time has experienced significant downturns 
downturns in the industry often occur in connection with  or anticipation of  maturing 
table of contents product cycles for semiconductor companies and their customers  and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns can cause abrupt fluctuations in product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of average selling prices 
the recent emergence of a number of negative economic factors and the downturn in our industry could harm our revenue and our results of operations 
any downturn in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints  which may affect our revenue if we are unable to ship products to meet customer requirements 
the recent worldwide economic downturn makes it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
this downturn could delay and or lengthen sales cycles by causing us and foreign businesses to slow or postpone spending on our products and services 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery  worldwide  or in the semiconductor industry 
the combination of our lengthy sales cycle coupled with challenging macroeconomic conditions could have a synergistic negative impact on the results of our operations 
our success for the foreseeable future will depend on our ability to develop and market new products in the digital markets 
in recent years  we have derived a majority of our product revenues from the sale of integrated circuits for dvd and digital camera applications 
we expect that sales of our products for these applications will account for a smaller portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
our future financial performance will depend on our ability to successfully develop and market new products in the digital television  hdtv and digital imaging markets 
if the markets for these products and applications decline or fail to develop as expected  or we are not successful in our efforts to market and sell our products to manufacturers who incorporate integrated circuits into these products  our financial results will be harmed 
our financial performance is highly dependent on the timely and successful introduction of new and enhanced products 
our financial performance depends in large part on our ability to successfully develop and market next generation and new products in a rapidly changing technological environment 
if we fail to successfully identify new product opportunities and timely develop and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance  we may lose our market share and our future revenues and earnings may suffer 
in the consumer electronics market  our performance has been dependent on our successful development and timely introduction of integrated circuits for dvd players  digital cameras  multimedia accelerators for mobile phones  digital televisions  set top boxes and digital imaging products 
these markets are characterized by the incorporation of a steadily increasing level of integration and numbers of features on a chip at the same or lower system cost  enabling original equipment manufacturers  or oems  to continually improve the features or reduce the prices of the systems they sell 
if we are unable to continually develop and introduce integrated circuits with increasing levels of integration and new features at competitive prices  our operating results will suffer 
in the imaging market  our performance has been dependent on our successful development and timely introduction of integrated circuits for printers and multi function peripherals 
these markets are characterized by the incorporation of a steadily increasing level of integration and higher speeds on a chip at the same or lower system cost  enabling oems to improve the performance and features or reduce the prices of the systems they sell 
if we are unable to develop and introduce integrated circuits with increasing levels of integration  performance and new features at competitive prices  our operating results will suffer 
the performance of our software licensing business is dependent on our ability to develop and introduce new releases of our software  which incorporate new or enhanced printing standards  as well as performance enhancements required by our oem customers 
if we are unable to develop and release versions of our software supporting required standards and offering enhanced performance  our operating results will suffer 

table of contents we face competition or potential competition from companies with greater resources than ours  and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  declining average unit selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with solutions which may be less costly or provide higher performance or more desirable features than our products 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  when customers evaluate alternative design approaches requiring integrated circuits 
because of short product life cycles  there are frequent design win competitions for next generation systems 
our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technological  market  distribution and other resources 
these competitors may also have broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers and suppliers than we have 
some of our principal competitors maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from capacity  cost and technical advantages 
our principal competitors in the integrated audio and video devices for dvd applications include mediatek inc and sunplus technology co 
ltd 
in the markets for digital cameras  our principal competitors are in house solutions developed and used by major japanese oems  as well as products sold by ambarella  fujitsu  mediatek inc  novatech  sunplus and texas instruments  inc in the market for multimedia acceleration for mobile phones  our principal competitors include amd  broadcom corp  corelogic  mtekvision co 
ltd  nvidia and telechips inc our principal competitors for digital semiconductor devices in the digital television market include broadcom corp  m star  mediatek inc and st microelectronics 
others who also participate in this market are micronas  nxp and trident microsystems  inc competitors in the printer and multifunction peripheral space include adobe  conexant systems  inc  global graphics  marvell semiconductor  inc and in house captive suppliers 
the dvd player market has slowed  and continued competition will lead to further price reductions and reduced profit margins 
we also face significant competition in the digital imaging and digital camera markets 
the future growth of both markets is highly dependent on oems continuing to outsource an increasing portion of their product development work 
many of our existing competitors  as well as oem customers that are expected to compete with us in the future  have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we have 
in addition  much of our future success is dependent on the success of our oem customers 
if we or our oem customers are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors  we could experience price reductions  order cancellations and reduced gross margins  any one of which could harm our business 
we must keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards to remain competitive 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and our customers changing demands 
the consumer electronics market  in particular  is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of integration 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
if new industry standards emerge  our products or the products of our customers could become unmarketable or obsolete  and we could lose market share or be required to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
our success will also depend on the successful development of new markets and the application and acceptance of new technologies and products in those new markets 
for example  our success will depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products in the digital television and 
table of contents set top box markets and to introduce and promote those products successfully 
these markets may not continue to develop to the extent or in the time periods that we currently anticipate due to factors outside our control 
if new markets do not develop as we anticipate  or if our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
the emergence of new markets for our products is also dependent in part upon third parties developing and marketing content in a format compatible with commercial and consumer products that incorporate our products 
if this content is not available  manufacturers may not be able to sell products incorporating our products  and our sales would suffer 
our new frame rate conversion technology remains unproven  and if it is not accepted by our customers  our financial results and ability to compete could be harmed 
through our acquisition of let it wave in june  we acquired a frame rate conversion technology that is currently under development 
we plan to continue to invest in developing this technology and to make it available for customer integration in the future 
there is no assurance  however  that this new technology will be accepted by our customers 
in addition  our competitors may develop a superior performance image processing technology and introduce it in the market before us 
if we cannot successfully market and sell our new frame rate conversion technology  we will not be able to recoup our costs of acquiring let it wave and further development costs for this technology  and our financial results and ability to compete could be adversely affected 
we rely on independent foundries and contractors for the manufacture  assembly and testing of our integrated circuits and other hardware products  and the failure of any of these third parties to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers and harm our sales and financial results 
we do not operate any manufacturing facilities  and we rely on independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our products 
these independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design 
from time to time  there are manufacturing capacity shortages in the semiconductor industry 
we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our suppliers  including our principal supplier taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  and our principal assembly houses 
therefore  tsmc and our other suppliers are not obligated to manufacture products for us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
our reliance on independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the inability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity  the unavailability of or interruption of access to certain process technologies necessary for manufacture of our products  lack of control over delivery schedules  lack of control over quality assurance  lack of control over manufacturing yields and cost  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  tsmc and some of our other foundries are located in areas of the world that are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes 
while the earthquake in taiwan did not have a material impact on our independent foundries  a similar event centered near tsmc s facility could severely reduce tsmc s ability to manufacture our integrated circuits 
the loss of any of our manufacturers as a supplier  our inability to expand the supply of their products in response to increased demand  or our inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from our current or future suppliers due to a natural disaster or any other reason could delay or reduce shipments of our products 
any of these circumstances could damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our sales and financial results 

table of contents we also rely on a limited number of independent contractors for the assembly and testing of our products 
our reliance on independent assembly and testing houses limits our control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and product cost 
disruptions in the services provided by our assembly or testing houses or other circumstances that would require them to seek alternative sources of assembly or testing could lead to supply constraints or delays in the delivery of our products 
these constraints or delays could damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our financial results 
because foundry capacity is limited from time to time  we may be required to enter into costly long term supply arrangements to secure foundry capacity 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers would be harmed and our sales would likely be reduced 
in order to secure additional foundry capacity  we have considered  and may in the future need to consider  various arrangements with suppliers  which could include  among others option payments or other prepayments to a foundry  nonrefundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments  contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of silicon wafers over extended periods  issuance of our equity securities to a foundry  investment in a foundry  joint ventures  or other partnership relationships with foundries 
we may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all  and such arrangements  if any  may not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties 
such penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 
if our independent foundries do not achieve satisfactory yields  our relationships with our customers may be harmed 
the fabrication of silicon wafers is a complex process 
minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in photo masks used to print circuits on a wafer  difficulties in the fabrication process or other factors can cause a substantial portion of the integrated circuits on a wafer to be non functional 
many of these problems are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct 
as a result  foundries often experience problems achieving acceptable yields  which are represented by the number of good integrated circuits as a proportion of the number of total integrated circuits on any particular wafer 
poor yields from our independent foundries would reduce our ability to deliver our products to customers  harm our relationships with our customers and harm our business 
we are dependent upon our international sales and operations  economic  political or military events in a country where we make significant sales or have significant operations could interfere with our success or operations there and harm our business 
during  of our total revenues were derived outside of north america 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
substantially all of our semiconductor products are manufactured  assembled and tested outside of the united states by independent foundries and subcontractors 

table of contents we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally  including operating in new countries where we have limited or no experience  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuations in exchange rates  political and economic instability  armed conflicts or other crises  imposition of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and health risks in a particular region 
a material amount of our research and development personnel and facilities and a portion of our sales and marketing personnel are located in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations 
for example  increased violence or armed conflict in israel or the palestinian territories may disrupt travel and communications in the region  harming our operations there 
furthermore  some of our employees in israel are obligated to perform up to days of military reserve duty annually and may be called to active duty in a time of crisis 
the absence of these employees for significant periods during the work week may cause us to operate inefficiently during these periods 
our operations in china are subject to the economic and political uncertainties affecting that country 
for example  the chinese economy has experienced significant growth in the past decade  but such growth has been uneven across geographic and economic sectors 
this growth may decrease and any slowdown may have a negative effect on our business 
we also maintain offices in canada  england  france  india  japan  korea and taiwan  and our operations are subject to the economic and political uncertainties affecting these countries as well 
the significant concentration of our manufacturing activities with third party foundries in taiwan exposes us to the risk of political instability in taiwan  including the potential for conflict between taiwan and china 
we have several significant oem customers in japan  korea and other parts of asia 
adverse economic circumstances in asia could affect these customers willingness or ability to do business with us in the future or their success in developing and launching devices containing our products 
the complexity of our international operations may increase our operating expenses and disrupt our revenues and business 
we transact business and have operations worldwide 
for example  international transactions form a substantial majority of our sales  our semiconductor products are manufactured  assembled and tested outside of the united states  and in june we acquired a foreign corporation 
our global operations involve significant complexity and difficulties  including monitoring and complying with applicable laws and regulatory requirements  staffing and managing global operations  complying with statutory equity requirements  and managing tax consequences 
if we are unable to manage the complexity of our global operations successfully  our financial performance and operating results could suffer 

table of contents the prices of our products may become less competitive due to foreign exchange fluctuations 
foreign currency fluctuations may affect the prices of our products 
prices for our products are currently denominated in us dollars for sales to our customers throughout the world 
if there is a significant devaluation of the currency in a specific country  the prices of our products will increase relative to that country s currency  our products may be less competitive in that country and our revenues may be adversely affected 
also  we cannot be sure that our international customers will continue to be willing to place orders denominated in us dollars 
if they do not  our revenue and operating results will be subject to foreign exchange fluctuations 
because we have significant operations in israel  our business and future operating results could be harmed by terrorist activity or military conflict 
we conduct a significant portion of our research and development and engineering activities at our design center in haifa  israel  a  square foot facility where we employ approximately people 
we also conduct a portion of our sales and marketing operations at our haifa facility 
we have an additional  square foot facility in kfar netter  israel  where we conduct research and development activities 
any armed conflict affecting israel could greatly disrupt our israeli operations locally and as a result hinder our business generally by delaying product development or interfering with global sales and marketing efforts 
for example  as a result of the heightened military operations in gaza some of our employees were conscripted for several weeks ending in january additional employees may also be called to active duty in the future 
extended absences could disrupt our operations and delay product development cycles 
in addition  military conflict in the middle east or terrorist activities there or elsewhere in the world could harm our business as a result of a disruption in commercial activity affecting international commerce or a general economic slowdown and reduced demand for consumer electronic products 
changes in  or interpretations of  tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations 
our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws  by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates  by changes in the geography of our income or losses  or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the ultimate outcomes of any future tax audits are uncertain  and we can give no assurance as to whether an adverse result from one or more of them will have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
the inflation in foreign countries or the decline in the value of united states dollar compared to those foreign currencies may negatively impact our costs 
a portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities is incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  we bear the risk that the rate of inflation in those foreign countries or the decline in the value of united states dollar compared to those foreign currencies will increase our costs as expressed in united states dollars 
to date  we have not engaged in hedging transactions 
in the future  we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against foreign currencies 
these measures may not adequately protect us from the impact of inflation in foreign countries 
we derive most of our revenue from sales to a small number of large customers  and if we are not able to retain these customers  or they reschedule  reduce or cancel orders  our revenues would be reduced and our financial results would suffer 
our largest customers have accounted for a substantial percentage of our revenues 
in  three customers accounted for  and of our total revenues  respectively  while sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of our total revenues 
in  one customer accounted for of our total revenues  and 
table of contents sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of our total revenues 
sales to these large customers have varied significantly from year to year and will continue to fluctuate in the future 
these sales also may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
we may not be able to retain our key customers  or these customers may cancel purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from us 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our key customers could harm our sales and financial results 
in addition  any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more key customers could harm our financial results 
as of december  four customers accounted for approximately   and of the net accounts receivable balance  respectively 
our products generally have long sales cycles and implementation periods  which increases our costs in obtaining orders and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
our products are technologically complex 
prospective customers generally must make a significant commitment of resources to test and evaluate our products and to integrate them into larger systems 
as a result  our sales processes are often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes that typically accompany the design and testing of new products 
the sales cycles of our products often last for many months 
longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources in attempting to make sales and delay the generation of revenue 
long sales cycles also subject us to other risks  including customers budgetary constraints or insolvency  internal acceptance reviews and cancellations 
in addition  orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of the timing of customers purchase decisions 
the time required for our customers to incorporate our products into their own can vary significantly with the needs of our customers and generally exceeds several months  which further complicates our planning processes and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
we are not protected by long term contracts with our customers 
we generally do not enter into long term purchase contracts with our customers  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
customers generally purchase our products subject to cancelable short term purchase orders 
we cannot predict whether our current customers will continue to place orders  whether existing orders will be canceled  or whether customers who have ordered products will pay invoices for delivered products 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer 
early termination by one of our major customers would harm our financial results 
our products could contain defects  which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
we develop complex and evolving products 
despite testing by us and our customers  errors may be found in existing or new products 
this could result in  among other things  a delay in recognition or loss of revenues  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
these defects may cause us to incur significant warranty  support and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with customers 
the occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business 
defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could result in financial or other damages to customers or could damage market acceptance of such products 
our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
regulation of our customers products may slow the process of introducing new products and could impair our ability to compete 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  has broad jurisdiction over our target markets in the digital television business 
various international entities or organizations may also regulate aspects of our 
table of contents business or the business of our customers 
although our products are not directly subject to regulation by any agency  the transmission pipes  as well as much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated  are subject to direct government regulation 
for example  before they can be sold in the united states  advanced televisions and emerging interactive displays must be tested and certified by underwriters laboratories and meet fcc regulations 
accordingly  the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which our customers operate may in turn harm our business 
fcc regulatory policies affecting the ability of cable operators or telephone companies to offer certain services and other terms on which these companies conduct their business may impede sales of our products 
in addition  our digital television business may also be adversely affected by the imposition of tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on our suppliers or by the imposition of export restrictions on products that we sell internationally 
changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations in the united states or elsewhere could harm our business 
our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protection of our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
these agreements and measures may not be sufficient to protect our technology from third party infringement  or to protect us from the claims of others 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
the protection offered by patents is subject to numerous uncertainties 
for example  our competitors may be able to effectively design around our patents  or the patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
those competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
moreover  while we hold  or have applied for  patents relating to the design of our products  some of our products are based in part on standards  for which we do not hold patents or other intellectual property rights 
we have generally limited access to and distribution of the source and object code of our software and other proprietary information 
with respect to our page description language software  system on a chip platform firmware and drivers for the digital office market and in limited circumstances with respect to firmware and platforms for our dtv products  we grant licenses that give our customers access to and restricted use of the source code of our software 
this access increases the likelihood of misappropriation or misuse of our technology 
claims and litigation regarding intellectual property rights and breach of contract claims could seriously harm our business and require us to incur significant costs 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
in the past  we have been subject to claims and litigation regarding alleged infringement of other parties intellectual property rights  and we have been parties to a number of patent related lawsuits  both as plaintiff and defendant 
we could become subject to additional litigation in the future  either to protect our intellectual property or as a result of allegations that we infringe others intellectual property rights or have breached our contractual obligations to others 
claims that our products infringe proprietary rights or that we have breached contractual obligations would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers or manufacturers against the alleged infringement or breach 
future litigation against us  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidation of our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their 
table of contents success  are time consuming and expensive to resolve and require significant management time and attention 
future intellectual property and breach of contract litigation could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  pay damages  or redesign those products that use such technology 
although patent disputes in the semiconductor industry have often been settled through cross licensing arrangements  we may not be able in any or every instance to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
we have a more limited patent portfolio than many of our competitors 
if a successful claim is made against us or any of our customers and a license is not made available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we are required to pay substantial damages or awards  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
if necessary licenses of third party technology are not available to us or are very expensive  our products could become obsolete 
from time to time  we may be required to license technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements 
third party licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any third party license required to develop new products and product enhancements  we may have to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  either of which could seriously harm the competitiveness of our products 
we rely on licenses to use various technologies that are material to our products 
we do not own the patents that underlie these licenses 
our rights to use these technologies and employ the inventions claimed in the licensed patents are subject to our abiding by the terms of the licenses 
under the license agreements we must fulfill confidentiality obligations and pay royalties 
if we fail to abide by the terms of the license  we would be unable to sell and market the products under license 
in addition  we do not control the prosecution of the patents subject to this license or the strategy for determining when such patents should be enforced 
as a result  we are dependent upon our licensor to determine the appropriate strategy for prosecuting and enforcing those patents 
if we are not able to apply our net operating losses against taxable income in future periods  our financial results will be harmed 
our future net income and cash flow will be affected by our ability to apply our net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  against taxable income in future periods 
our nols totaled approximately million for federal  million for state and million for foreign tax reporting purposes as of december  the internal revenue code contains a number of provisions that limit the use of nols under certain circumstances 
changes in tax laws in the united states may further limit our ability to utilize these nols 
any further limitation on our ability to utilize these respective nols could harm our financial condition 
any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and severely harm our financial condition 
we have made investments in  and acquisitions of other complementary companies  products and technologies  and we may acquire additional businesses  products or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute its current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  
table of contents use a significant amount of our cash  assume liabilities  incur expenses related to the future impairment of goodwill and the amortization of intangible assets  or incur other large write offs immediately or in the future 
our operation of acquired business will also involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies or products  acquisition of unproven technologies under development  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organizations 
in june we acquired let it wave  a french company  and its frame rate conversion technology  which is still in development 
there is no assurance that we will be able to complete the development of this technology and bring it to market 
we may not be able to successfully complete the integration of acquired in process products  technologies or personnel and any failure to do so could disrupt our business and seriously harm our financial condition 
if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 
we review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment  no less often than annually  when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
a change in circumstances may be indicated  and the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets may be impaired not be recoverable  where there are declines in our stock price and market capitalization  declines in expected future cash flows  or slower growth rates in our industry 
when we performed our annual impairment test in  we determined that goodwill and intangible assets related to our reporting units in the consumer business segment were impaired and therefore recorded a charge of million in the current year for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
if our future financial performance or other events indicate that the value of our recorded goodwill or intangibles is impaired  we may record additional impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  our impairment analysis involves determining the fair value of our business using a projected discounted cash flow analysis that is based on significant estimates  such as our projections of future sales volume and timing  margins and operating costs  and the discount rate we use to calculate present value of future cash flow 
changes to these estimates may cause us to recognize an impairment loss that could be material to our financial results 
if we fail to manage our future growth  if any  our business would be harmed 
we anticipate that our future growth  if any  will require us to recruit and hire a substantial number of new engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
our ability to manage growth successfully will also require us to expand and improve administrative  operational  management and financial systems and controls 
many of our key operations  including a material portion of our research and development operations and a significant portion of our sales and administrative operations are located in israel 
a majority of our sales and 
table of contents marketing and certain of our research and development and administrative personnel  including our president and chief executive officer and other officers  are based in the united states 
the geographic separation of these operations places additional strain on our resources and our ability to manage growth effectively 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business will be harmed 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 
at the end of december  we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  money market funds  auction rate securities and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
at december  we held auction rate securities ars with a par value of million 
historically  our ars were highly liquid  using a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every days  to provide liquidity at par 
however  as a result of liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets  the auctions for all of our ars failed beginning in the first quarter of  when sell orders exceeded buy orders 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of our ars at favorable pricing 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments and debt instruments is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale  generally no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 
recent events in the subprime mortgage market and with ars could negatively impact our return on investment for these debt securities and thereby reduce the amount of cash and cash equivalents and long term investments on our balance sheet 
we rely on the services of our executive officers and other key personnel  whose knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our senior management 
management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time upon short notice 
the loss of key personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise harm our business 
we believe that our future success will also depend in large part on our ability to attract  integrate and retain highly skilled engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel  located in the united states and overseas 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting  integrating and retaining such personnel 
failure to attract  integrate and retain key personnel could harm our ability to carry out our business strategy and compete with other companies 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of zoran 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these include provisions prohibiting a merger with a party that has acquired control of or more of our outstanding common stock  such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer  until three years after that party acquired control of of our outstanding common stock  
table of contents authorizing the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock  eliminating stockholders rights to call a special meeting of stockholders  and requiring advance notice of any stockholder nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors 
our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering in between january  and december   the sale prices of our common stock  as reported on the nasdaq stock market  ranged from a low of to a high of 
the market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in the future in response to a variety of factors  including announcements concerning our business or that of our competitors or customers  annual and quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in analysts earnings estimates  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by zoran or its competitors  loss of key personnel  proprietary rights or other litigation  general conditions in the semiconductor industry  and developments in the financial markets 
from time to time the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for semiconductor companies or technology companies generally and which have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
broad market fluctuations of this type may reduce the future market price of our common stock 
item b unresolved staff comments none item properties our executive offices and principal marketing  sales and product development operations are located in approximately  square feet of leased space in sunnyvale  california  under a lease that expires in september a significant portion of our research and development and engineering facilities and our administration operations are currently located in approximately  square feet of leased space in an industrial park in haifa  israel under a lease expiring in november we also lease facilities  primarily for sales  product development  and technical support  in burlington  massachusetts  manchester  england  paris  france  tokyo  japan  seoul  korea  taipei  taiwan and shenzhen  shanghai and hong kong  china 
we believe that our current facilities are adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future and that  should it be needed  suitable additional space in each of the locations where we operate will be available to accommodate expansion of our operations on commercially reasonable terms

indemnification obligations 
subject to certain limitations  the company is obligated to indemnify its current and former directors  officers and employees in connection with the investigation of the company s historical stock option practices and related government inquiries and litigation which concluded during these obligations arise under the terms of the company s certificate of incorporation  its bylaws  applicable contracts  and delaware and california law 
the obligation to indemnify generally means that the company is required to pay or reimburse the individuals reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters 
the company is currently paying or reimbursing legal expenses incurred in connection with these matters by a number of its current and former directors  officers and employees 
other legal matters 
the company is named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course of its business 
litigation in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations

forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a risk factors above 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
the company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements for any reason  except as required by law 
overview our products include integrated circuits and related products used in dvd players  movie and home theater systems  digital cameras and video editing systems  standard and high definition digital televisions  and set top boxes 
we also provide high performance  low power application processors  technology and products for the multimedia mobile phone market  and digital imaging semiconductor products and software that enable users to print  scan  process and transmit documents 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems that incorporate them into products for consumer and commercial applications  and to resellers 
although we experienced significant revenue growth in the dtv and mobile phone processor product lines  some of our other product lines saw considerable revenue declines based on lower demand as a result of the global economic slowdown in in response to the challenging economic environment we are taking steps to control costs while maintaining a strong balance sheet 
revenues we derive most of our revenues from the sale of our integrated circuit and system on a chip products 
historically  average selling prices for our products  consistent with average selling prices for products in the semiconductor industry generally  have decreased over time 
average selling prices for our products have fluctuated substantially from period to period  reflecting changes in our mix of sales to oem customers versus resellers and transitions from low volume to high volume production 
in the past  we have periodically reduced the prices of some of our products in order to better penetrate the consumer market 
we believe that  as our product lines continue to mature and competitive markets evolve  we are likely to experience further declines in the average selling prices of our products  although we cannot predict the timing and amount of such future changes with any certainty 
we also derive revenues from licensing our software and other intellectual property 
licensing revenues include one time license fees and royalties based on the number of units distributed by the licensee 
quarterly licensing revenues can be significantly affected by the timing of a small number of licensing transactions  each accounting for substantial revenues 
accordingly  licensing revenues have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  on a quarterly basis 
our software license agreements typically include obligations to provide maintenance and other support over a fixed term and allow for renewal of maintenance services on an annual basis 
we determine the fair value of our maintenance obligations with reference to substantive renewal rates within the agreement or objective evidence of fair value as required under statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
we recognize maintenance and support revenue ratably over the term of the arrangement 
we also receive royalty revenues based on per unit shipments of products that include our software  which we recognize upon receipt of a royalty report from the customer  typically one quarter in arrears 
we also generate a portion of our revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers 
revenue from development contracts are generally recognized as the services are performed based on the 
table of contents specific deliverables outlined in each contract 
amounts received in advance of performance under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and are generally recognized within one year from receipt 
cost of hardware product revenues our cost of hardware product revenues consist primarily of fabrication costs  assembly and test costs  and the cost of materials and overhead from operations 
if we are unable to reduce our cost of hardware product revenues to offset anticipated decreases in average selling prices  our product gross margins will decrease 
we expect both product and customer mix to continue to fluctuate in future periods  causing fluctuations in margins 
research and development our research and development expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities and costs of engineering materials and supplies 
we believe that significant investments in research and development are required for us to remain competitive  and we expect to continue to devote significant resources to product development  although such expenses as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate 
from time to time  we enter into non refundable joint development projects in which our customers reimburse us for a portion of our development costs 
we record such reimbursement of development costs as an offset to research and development expenses as we retain ownership of the intellectual property developed by us under these development arrangements 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  sales commissions  product promotion and other professional services 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase to support our anticipated growth 
income taxes our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses 
our current tax expense reflects taxes expected to be owed in our profitable jurisdictions 
in addition  due to economic changes in the global economy during  we have identified material foreign jurisdictions where it is no longer more likely than not that we will fully utilize our deferred tax assets  and have recorded a full valuation allowance on those assets 
our israel based subsidiary is an approved enterprise under israeli law  which provides a ten year tax holiday for income attributable to a portion of our operations in israel 
our us federal net operating losses expire at various times between and  and the benefits from our subsidiary s approved enterprise status expire at various times beginning in we are currently under a tax audit in israel for tax years through we believe that we have adequately provided for any potential assessments associated with this audit 
it is possible that the amount of our liability for unrecognized income tax benefits may change within the next months 
in addition  our income tax expense could be affected as other events occur  income tax audits conclude or statutes of limitations expire 
we cannot estimate at this time the range of possible variations in our tax expense 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we record liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
actual tax liabilities may be different than the recorded estimates and could result in an additional charge or benefit to the tax provision in the period when the ultimate tax assessment is determined 

table of contents acquisition on june   we completed the acquisition of let it wave  a fabless development stage semiconductor company based in paris  france 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we acquired let it wave in an all cash transaction valued at million including approximately  of transaction costs 
we also agreed to make contingent payments of up to million in additional consideration  contingent upon completion of certain milestones  a portion of which was subject to continuous employment and was to be expensed as incurred 
the milestones were not achieved and thus there were no payments in relation to the milestones 
the payments of  related to continuous employment will continue to be expensed as incurred through we recorded an in process research and development expense of million in connection with the acquisition 
let it wave is at least six months from completing the development of its motion compensated frame rate conversion mcfrc product and currently has no other products  revenues or a customer base 
we expect that the in process technology will be successfully completed by the second quarter of  with an estimated cost to complete of approximately million 
we accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets and emerging issues task force no 
eitf  determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business 
following the completion of the acquisition  the results of operations of let it wave have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  our results of operations for the year ended december  include let it wave s operations from the acquisition date 
segments our products consist of application specific integrated circuits  or asics  and system on a chip  or soc  products 
we also license certain software and other intellectual property 
we operate in two operating segments consumer and imaging 
the consumer group provides products for use in dvd players  recordable dvd players  standard and high definition digital television products  digital cameras and multimedia mobile phones 
the imaging group provides products used in digital copiers  laser and inkjet printers  and multifunction peripherals 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including bad debt  inventories  investments  intangible assets and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we generally recognize product sales to distributors at the time of shipment 
however  in some cases we grant rights of return or provide price protection arrangements 
we establish a reserve for the 
table of contents estimated allowances and recognize the balance of the product revenue associated with that arrangement upon shipment 
the deferred revenue balance from these arrangements at the end of each accounting period was not material 
revenue from development contracts is generally recognized as the services are performed based on the specific deliverables outlined in each contract 
amounts received in advance of performance under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and are generally recognized within one year from receipt 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions 
inventory write downs are not reversed and permanently reduce the cost basis of the affected inventory until such inventory is sold or scrapped 
we assess the valuation of our inventory in each reporting period 
although we attempt to forecast future inventory demand  given the competitive pressures and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  there may be significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments that could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
inventory write downs inherently involve judgments as to assumptions about expected future demand and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
although we believe that the assumptions we used in estimating inventory write downs are reasonable  significant changes in any one of the assumptions in the future could produce a significantly different result 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
there can be no assurances that future events and changing market conditions will not result in significant increases in inventory write downs 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the delays or inability of certain customers to make required payments 
these allowances are estimated based on specific identification of facts and circumstances with respect to each doubtful account 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets exceeds their fair value 
we assess the carrying value of our long lived assets if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
with respect to both goodwill and long lived assets  factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset or a significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time  relative to net book value 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  control premiums  the fair values of certain assets based on appraisals  and industry trends 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our net income loss 
we have accounted for stock based compensation under statement of financial accounting standards sfas r revised  share based payment sfas r and sec staff accounting bulletin sab which requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model that we use was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of underlying stock 
our expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of our common stock 
we determined that historical volatility reflects market conditions and is a good indicator of future volatility 
our expected term represents the period that our stock based awards are 
table of contents expected to be outstanding and was determined based on our historical experience with similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards and vesting schedules 
see notes and to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 
we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies 
an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 
see note to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  for a detailed description 
we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequence of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
realization of deferred tax assets is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
the release of our valuation allowance in was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for income taxes sfas which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
recent operating results and continuing uncertainty about projected income represent sufficient negative evidence that we now believe that it is no longer more likely than not that some of our deferred tax assets will be realized and accordingly  a valuation allowance was recorded in the fourth quarter of in certain material foreign jurisdictions 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 
an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 as of january  prior to adoption  our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the best estimate of known tax contingencies 
fin no 
requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions 
fin no 
requires us to recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of success upon settlement 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and related regulations 
accordingly  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
with respect to mergers and acquisitions  we assess the technological feasibility of in process research and development projects and determine the number of alternative future uses for the technology being developed 
to the extent there are no alternative future uses we allocate a portion of the purchase price to in process research and development expense 
this expense is generally estimated based upon the projected fair value of the technology  as determined by a discounted future cash flow reduced by the cost to complete 
this analysis includes certain estimates and assumptions made by management 
for larger acquisitions  we have historically engaged an external appraiser to assist with the assumptions and models used in this analysis 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no  which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we have adopted the provisions of sfas with respect to our financial assets and liabilities only 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on 
table of contents the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  that may be used to measure fair value  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
securities classified as level instruments consist of auction rate securities with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars whose underlying assets primarily consists of student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
these ars securities represent approximately of our total investment portfolio 
in february  auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid 
typically  the fair value of ars investments approximates par value due to the frequent interest rate resets associated with the auction process 
as a result of the auction market cessation  we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the contractual rate 
due to the current economic environment in which there is a lack of market activity for ars  we have been unable to obtain quoted prices or market prices for identical assets as of the measurement date resulting in significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value 
we estimated the fair value of these ars using the income approach based on the following i the underlying structure and contractual provisions of each security  ii the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  and iii consideration of the probabilities of default  auction failure  or repurchase at par for each period 
these estimated fair values could change significantly based on future market conditions  which could result in recognizing an other than temporary impairment loss 
based on this level valuation  we valued the ars investments at million  which represents a decline in value of million from par 
we also accepted an offer from one of our investment managers that entitle us to sell our ars to them at par starting june in october  we also received communications from wachovia securities indicating that wachovia securities expected to launch an offer to purchase ars held by us beginning no later than june  and ending no later than june   at par value 
the fair value of the ars with wachovia approximates the par value 
we valued the ars rights using a discounted cash flow approach including estimates of  based on data available as of december   interest rates  timing and amount of cash flow  adjusted for any bearer risk associated with financial ability of one of our investment managers to repurchase the ars beginning june these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in october the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp  to clarify the application of the provisions of sfas in an inactive market and how an entity would determine fair value in an inactive market 
fsp became effective october the application of the provision of fsp did not affect our results of operations or financial condition as of and for the year ended december  effective january   we adopted sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for specified financial assets and liabilities on a 
table of contents contract by contract basis 
we adopted the fair value option under this statement for our ars rights 
the enforceability of the ars rights results in a put option and should be recognized as a free standing asset separate from the ars 
as of december   we recorded million as the fair value of the ars rights with a corresponding credit to interest income 
after determining the fair value of our available for sales debt instruments  gains or losses on these securities are recorded to other comprehensive income  until either the security is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary 
the primary differentiating factors considered by us to classify our impairments between temporary and other than temporary impairments are our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  the length of the time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
given the current market conditions  these judgments could prove to be wrong  and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations 
no impairment charges were recorded during the years ended december   and as of december  and  our cumulative unrealized gains losses  net of tax benefit  related to our investments classified as available for sale was approximately million and million  respectively 
these unrecognized losses could be recognized in the future if our other than temporary assessment changes 
we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of september  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impairment is tested at the reporting unit level which is one level below the reportable segments 
the consumer segment has two reporting units home entertainment and mobile  and the imaging segment has one reporting unit 
potential goodwill impairment is measured based upon a two step process 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of an impairment loss 
the fair values of the reporting units were estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
the total of all reporting unit fair values was also compared to our market capitalization plus a control premium for reasonableness 
we assumed a cash flow period of years  long term annual growth rate of to  discount rates of to and terminal value growth rates of 
the discount rates are higher than the ones used in previous annual impairment tests due to the increase in the inherent risks in the markets in which we serve as a result of the current economic crisis 
as a result of this test  we determined that the carrying amounts of our consumer segment reporting units exceeded their fair values and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million and an impairment charge for purchased technology  customer base  tradename and other intangibles of million in the current year 
the impairment charge was primarily due to a decrease in valuation based on a decline in our business forecasts as a result of the current economic downturn as well as a significant decline in our stock value over the last two quarters due to the current global financial crisis

partially offsetting the decrease in dvd and mobile products revenue was an increase in dtv products revenue of million 
the decrease in imaging segment revenues was due to a reduction in imaging hardware product revenues of million and a decrease in imaging software and other revenues of million 
we believe that the recent worldwide economic downturn has adversely affected the markets that our customers serve  and we expect this impact may continue to reduce sales of our products until the economy begins to recover 
hardware product revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in hardware product revenues decreased million in the consumer segment and million in the imaging segment 
within the consumer segment  hardware product revenues for dvd products decreased by million primarily as a result of lower unit shipments and hardware product revenues for mobile products decreased by million  primarily due to lower average selling prices

the decrease in imaging hardware product revenues was primarily due to reduced unit shipments 
software and other revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the changes in software and other revenues were primarily due to decrease in royalty revenues from customers in the imaging segment due to decrease in unit shipments of products that include our software and the timing of new agreements 
cost of hardware product revenues cost of hardware product revenues were million in compared to million in and of hardware product revenues  respectively 
the increase in hardware product costs as a percentage of hardware product revenues in versus was primarily a result of product mix products with a higher percent of cost per revenue represented a greater proportion of products sold 
in addition  in the first half of  we experienced initial cost challenges related to ramp in volume of certain new products 
cost of hardware product revenues as a percentage of product revenue was also impacted by declines in average selling prices  particularly for our mobile and dvd products 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or

at december   we had approximately million in net intangible assets acquired through the let it wave acquisition  which we will continue to amortize on a straight line basis through impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the current year  as a result of our annual impairment test  we determined that the carrying amount of certain reporting units exceeded their fair value resulting in an impairment charge of million related to goodwill recorded in our consumer business segment and million related to intangible assets in our consumer business segment 
refer to note to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on the impairments 
in process research and development in  we recorded an in process research and development expense of million as part of the june acquisition of let it wave 
the in process research and development has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use 
accordingly the amount allocated to in process research and development was immediately expensed upon the acquisition date 
the value of in process research and development was determined using the multi period excess earnings method by estimating the expected net cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 
this rate was based on the industry segment for the technology  nature of the products to be developed  relative risk of successful development  time value of money  length of time to complete the project and overall maturity and history of the development team 
revenues for the incremental core technology are expected to commence in revenue projections were based on estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the expected timing of new product introductions 
as of december   there have been no material variations from the underlying assumptions that were used in the original computation of the value of the acquired entity 
there were no charges recorded for in process research and development in interest and other income expense interest and other income expense was million in compared to million in interest income was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest income in was primarily due to lower average interest earned on our cash and short term investment balances due to declines in the interest rate 
interest and other income  net during the year ended december  included a gain of million from rights offered by ubs  largely offset by the losses recorded on the auction rate securities from ubs due to a reclassification of these securities from available for sale to trading 
other expense was million in compared to million in the changes in other expense in compared to was primarily due to foreign currency remeasurement losses as a result of the decline in the value of the us dollar in comparison to currencies in countries in which we operate and fluctuations in realized gains due to timing of sale of investments 
other expense in included a write down of a long term equity investment in a private company by million 
provision benefit for income taxes we recorded a tax provision of million in compared to a tax benefit of million in the provision is primarily for the accrual of taxes we expect to owe in our profitable jurisdictions and an expense of million associated with a valuation allowance in foreign jurisdictions where it is no longer more likely than not that we will fully utilize our deferred tax assets 
in addition  due to statute of limitations lapses in 
table of contents various jurisdictions  there was a release of approximately million of our fin no 
liability 
the tax benefit for the year ended december  of million included a benefit of million  net of provision  from the release of the valuation allowance at december  the income tax provision benefit for these periods was affected by the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings and losses  the impacts of recording or removing the valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets  non deductible expenses such as sfas r stock based compensation expense  as well as the accrual of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits 
our israel based subsidiary is an approved enterprise under israeli law  which provides a ten year tax holiday for income attributable to a portion of our operations in israel 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in total revenues for the year ended december  included million in revenues related to the litigation settlement that did not recur 
excluding the litigation settlement revenues  revenues for increased by million compared to the same period in this increase was a result of a million increase in the consumer segment revenues and an million increase in the imaging segment revenues 
the increase in consumer segment revenues in was driven by an increase in revenues for mobile products of million or offset by decreases in revenues of million and million for dvd and dtv products respectively 
the increase in imaging segment revenues in of million or was due to an increase in hardware product revenues of million and an increase in software and other revenues of million 
hardware product revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in reflecting increases of million in the consumer segment and million in the imaging segment 
the increase in both the consumer and imaging segment revenues were primarily driven by increased unit shipments 
within the consumer segment  hardware product revenues increased million for mobile products and million for dtv products  partially offset by a decrease of million for dvd products 
the increase in hardware product revenues for mobile and dtv products was driven by increased unit shipments while the decrease in hardware product revenues for dvd products was due to a decrease in average selling prices 
software and other revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in primarily due to a million increase in imaging segment revenues driven by a million increase in royalty revenue 
cost of hardware product revenues cost of hardware product revenues were million in compared to million in the increase in costs was primarily a result of the corresponding increase in hardware product revenues 
as a percentage of hardware product revenues  hardware product costs were in compared to in the decrease in hardware product costs as a percentage of hardware product revenues in versus was associated with lower per unit product costs and a change in product mix as revenues from the lower margin dvd product line represented a smaller proportion of total hardware product revenue with a relative increase in revenue from the higher margin mobile and imaging product lines 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or

interest and other income expense the increase in interest and other income expense in compared to reflect higher average cash and investment balances 
other income expense in included foreign currency remeasurement losses as a result of the decline in the value of the us dollar in comparison to currencies in countries in which we operate as well as a write down of a long term equity investment in a private company by million 
provision benefit for income taxes the tax benefit for the year ended december  of million reflects a provision of million and a benefit of million from the release of the valuation allowance at december  at the time  we believed that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be fully utilized in the future  and accordingly  we released the valuation allowance on those assets at year end 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence supported the conclusion that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result  the balance sheet at december  reflected million of deferred tax assets 
the offsetting benefit was allocated million to decrease goodwill and million to previously unbenefitted withholding taxes and million to deferred tax benefit 
the current provision of million is primarily due to federal and foreign accrued liabilities 
the tax provision for the year ended december  of million included a one time charge of million for tax expense related to litigation settlement 
the remaining tax expense is related to the utilization of previously unbenefitted purchased nols which when utilized reduce goodwill and not tax expense along with statutory taxes in our non us subsidiaries 
our effective income tax rate has benefited from the availability of previously unbenefitted nols which we have utilized to reduce tax expense for us federal income tax purposes and by our israel based subsidiary s status as an approved enterprise under israeli law  which provides a ten year tax holiday for income attributable to a portion of our operations in israel 
our us federal nols expire at various times between and  and the benefits from our subsidiary s approved enterprise status expire at various times beginning in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments 
at december   we had million of working capital 
our operating activities generated cash of million during while we recorded a net loss of million  this loss included non cash items such as impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of million  amortization of intangible assets of million  depreciation of million  in process research and 
table of contents development expense of million  stock based compensation expense of million and deferred income taxes of million resulting in our net income adjusted for non cash items totaling million 
cash flow from changes in assets and liabilities was insignificant and was due to decreases in accounts receivable by million due to the timing of collections  inventory by million due to lower levels based on reduced demand and prepaid expenses  other current assets and other assets by million 
these changes were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities totaling million due to timing of payments 
cash used in investing activities was million during proceeds from sales and maturities of investments  net of purchases  of million was offset by million used for the acquisition of let it wave and million used for purchases of property and equipment 
cash used in financing activities during was million 
repurchases of common stock of million under our stock repurchase program was offset by million of proceeds received from issuances of common stock through exercises of stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
our operating activities generated cash of million during  primarily due to net income of million and non cash items such as amortization of million  depreciation of million  stock based compensation expense of million and deferred tax benefit of million due to the release of the deferred tax valuation allowance 
cash provided by operations also increased due to a million increase in accounts payable  million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities due to timing of payments 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable by million due to increase in revenues  an increase in inventories by million to meet the increasing demand for our products and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets by million 
cash used in investing activities was million during  principally reflecting the net purchase of investments of million 
in addition we spent million for the purchases of property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was million during and consisted of proceeds received from issuances of common stock through exercises of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to the type of financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we believe that our current balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and anticipated cash flows from operations  will satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through the next months 
nonetheless  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend on many factors including  but not limited to the levels at which we maintain inventories and accounts receivable  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch our new products or to enter markets and attain a competitive position in the marketplace  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and technology roadmap  volume pricing concessions  
table of contents capital improvements  technological advances  the response of competitors to our products  and our relationships with suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require an increase in the level of working capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring and infrastructure needs 
additional capital may also be required for additional acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
to the extent that our existing resources and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or borrowings 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
at december  we held ars with a par value of million and a fair value of million 
during the year ended december   we sold million of our ars at par value 
our ars are high grade long term debt instruments backed by student loans which are guaranteed by the united states government 
all of our ars have credit ratings of aaa or aa  and none are mortgage backed debt obligations 
historically  our ars were highly liquid  using a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every days  to provide liquidity at par 
however  as a result of liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets  the auctions for most of our ars failed beginning in the first quarter of when sell orders exceeded buy orders 
the failures of these auctions do not affect the value of the collateral underlying the ars  and we continue to earn and receive interest on our ars at a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indexes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our investment policy focuses on three objectives to preserve capital  to meet liquidity requirements and to maximize total return 
our investment policy establishes minimum ratings for each classification of investment and investment concentration is limited in order to minimize risk  and the policy also limits the final maturity on any investment and the overall duration of the portfolio 
given the overall market conditions  we regularly review our investment portfolio to ensure adherence to our investment policy and to monitor individual investments for risk analysis and proper valuation 
we hold our marketable securities as trading and available for sale and mark them to market 
we expect to realize the full value of our marketable securities upon maturity or sale  as we have the intent and believe we have the ability to hold the securities until the full value is realized 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that our invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets  which may require us to record an impairment charge that could adversely impact our financial results 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations in thousands contractual obligation total thereafter operating leases and license commitments purchase commitments total 
table of contents other commitments effective january   we adopted the provisions of fin no 
the above table does not reflect our december  unrecognized tax benefits of million 
if none of the unrecognized tax benefits are realized  our potential cash outflow is estimated to be million 
the timing of the cash outflow cannot be determined  however  it is possible that some of the cash payments may occur in the next twelve months 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we invest in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  money market funds  auction rate securities and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
we do not maintain derivative financial instruments 
we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities except for ars held by ubs are treated as available for sale under sfas investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because we classify our debt securities as available for sale no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in interest rates 
exchange rate risk currently  sales and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us 
a portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  asia and europe  are transacted in foreign currencies 
to date  we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although we may do so in the future 
significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates could impact our business in the future
