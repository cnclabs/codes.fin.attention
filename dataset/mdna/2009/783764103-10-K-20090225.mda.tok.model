results of operations overview operating conditions became progressively worse during as the economy s decline accelerated late in the year  extending the industry s downturn which began in since the latter half of  a lack of availability of mortgage products resulting from an industry wide increase in loan delinquency and foreclosure rates  as well as the related tightening of credit standards  has impacted the housing industry and the company s ability to attract qualified homebuyers 
these factors have exacerbated already high inventory levels of new and resale homes  increased cancellation levels and weakened consumer confidence 
demand pressure from foreclosures and unsettled credit markets continued through while rising unemployment and declining consumer confidence slowed the decline in existing and new housing inventories 
consequently  the company continued to report declines in the volume of homes sold  decreases in prices  high sales contract cancellation rates and as a result  recorded additional valuation adjustments 
in an effort to compensate for these developments  it has continued its operating strategy  focusing on cash generation and debt reduction through increased sales price discounts and other incentives  opportunistic land sales  monetization of its deferred tax assets through consummation of transactions creating loss carrybacks to  reductions in excess inventory and existing commitments to purchase land through contract renegotiations and cancellations  controlled development spending  renegotiations of contracts with subcontractors and suppliers  reductions in overhead expense to more closely match projected volume levels  and repayment or repurchase of debt at a discount 
as a result  the company operated from percent fewer active communities in than in  and its inventory of lots controlled as of december  was down percent from a year ago 
the company believes that access to traditional capital will be constrained in the early stages of a recovery and that lenders will migrate to homebuilders with the strongest balance sheets 
to insure that the company participates in the initial stages of a recovery  it has formed a limited liability company with oaktree capital  the purpose of which will be to jointly acquire and develop distressed and other residential real estate assets 
the company believes that its cash balances  low net debt to capital ratio  manageable inventory pipelines  and early access to liquidity and land will allow it to ultimately take advantage of opportunities that may arise facilitating accelerated growth and market share as conditions improve 
due to increased price reductions and sales incentives  evaluation of the company s inventory through quarterly impairment analyses during resulted in million of inventory valuation adjustments

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  inventory is reviewed for potential write downs on an ongoing basis 
sfas requires that  in the event that impairment indicators are present  impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts 
for inventory held and used  undiscounted cash flow projections are generated at a community level based on estimates of revenues  costs and other factors 
the company s analysis of these communities generally assumes current revenues equal to current sales orders for particular or comparable communities 
the company s determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with inherent risks that are associated with assets and related estimated cash flow streams 
when determining the value of inventory held for sale  the company considers recent offers  comparable sales and or estimated cash flows 
valuation adjustments are recorded against homes completed or under construction  land under development and improved lots when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values 
due to continued pressure on home prices symptomatic of excess home inventories in many markets  the company recorded inventory impairment charges of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  in order to reduce the carrying value of the impaired communities to their estimated fair value 
approximately percent of these impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held for development  while approximately percent of these charges were recorded to residential construction in progress and finished homes in inventory 
at december   the fair value of the company s inventory subject to valuation adjustments of million during the year  net of impairments  was million 
there were communities with write downs in  compared to communities in inventory and other impairment charges and write offs of deposits and acquisition costs reduced total housing gross profit margins by percent in  percent in and percent in should market conditions deteriorate or costs increase  it is possible that the company s estimates of undiscounted cash flows from its communities could decline  resulting in additional future inventory impairment charges

for the same period in  write offs of earnest money deposits and feasibility costs were million and million  respectively 
should weak homebuilding market conditions persist and the company be unsuccessful in its efforts to renegotiate certain land option purchase contracts  it may write off additional earnest money deposits and feasibility costs in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue  were percent for  percent for and percent for the percentage increase for  compared to  was mainly attributable to a decline in revenues  as well as to severance  relocation  model abandonment and goodwill impairment costs and charges that collectively totaled million  partially offset by lower marketing and advertising costs per unit

critical accounting policies preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the use of judgment in the application of accounting policies and estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
listed below are those policies that management believes are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
management has discussed the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of its board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure 
there are items within the financial statements that require estimation but are not considered critical 
use of estimates in budgeting land acquisitions  development and homebuilding construction costs associated with real estate projects  the company evaluates market conditions  material and labor costs  buyer preferences  construction timing  and provisions for insurance and warranty obligations 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable cost for resolution of legal claims 
estimates  which are based on historical experience and other assumptions  are reviewed continually  updated when necessary and believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes that the timing and scope of its evaluation procedures are proper and adequate 
changes in assumptions relating to such factors  however  could have a material effect on the company s results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period 
income recognition in accordance with sfas  revenues and cost of sales are recorded at the time each home or lot is closed  title and possession are transferred to the buyer  and there is no significant continuing involvement from the homebuilder 
in order to match revenues with related expenses  land  land development  interest  taxes and other related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future are allocated to the cost of homes closed  based upon the relative sales value basis of the total number of homes to be constructed in each community  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects 
estimated land  common area development and related costs of planned communities  including the cost of amenities  are allocated to individual parcels or communities on a relative sales value basis 
changes to estimated costs  subsequent to the commencement of the delivery of homes  are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community 
home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method 
inventory valuation housing projects and land held for development inventory and sale are stated at either the lower of cost or net realizable value 
inventory includes land and development costs  direct construction costs  capitalized indirect construction costs  capitalized interest  and real estate taxes 
it may take one to three years to develop  sell and deliver all of the homes in a typical community 
the company assesses these assets for recoverability in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas requires that long lived assets and assets held for sale be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of housing inventories is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or by the sales of comparable assets 
assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell 
these evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues  costs and expenses  as well as by other factors 
in addition  land  or costs related to future communities  whether owned or under option  are reviewed to determine if the company will proceed with development and if all related costs are recoverable 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and is recognized within the same period that it is identified 
management believes its processes are designed to properly assess the market and carrying values of assets 
warranty reserves the company s homes are sold with limited third party warranties 
warranty reserves are established as homes close on a house by house basis in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected costs of materials and outside labor during warranty periods 
certain factors are considered in determining the reserves  including the historical range of amounts paid per house  experience with respect to similar home designs and geographical areas  the historical amount paid as a percentage of home construction costs  any warranty expenditures not considered to be normal and recurring  and conditions that may affect certain subdivisions 
improvements in quality control and construction techniques expected to impact future warranty expenditures are also considered 
accordingly  the process of determining the company s warranty reserves balance necessarily requires estimates associated with various assumptions  each of which can positively or negatively impact this balance 
generally  warranty reserves are reviewed monthly to determine the reasonableness and adequacy of both the aggregate reserve and the per unit reserve amount originally included in home cost of sales  as well as the timing of any reversals of the original reserve 
general warranty reserves not utilized for a particular house are evaluated for reasonableness in the aggregate on both a market by market and consolidated basis 
warranty payments for an individual house may exceed the related reserve 
payments in excess of the reserve are evaluated in the aggregate to determine if an adjustment to the warranty reserve should be recorded  which could result in a corresponding adjustment to home cost of sales 
the company continues to evaluate the adequacy of its warranty reserves and believes that its existing estimation process is materially accurate 
because the company s warranty reserves can be impacted by a significant number of factors  it is possible that changes to the company s assumptions could have a material impact on its warranty reserve balances 
variable interest entities vie fin requires a vie to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities and or entitled to receive a majority of the vie s residual returns 
fin also requires disclosure about vies that the company is not obligated to consolidate but in which it has a significant  though not primary  variable interest 
the company enters into joint ventures  from time to time  for the purpose of acquisition and co development of land parcels and lots 
its investment in these joint ventures may create a variable interest in a vie  depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land for the construction of homes 
under such lot option purchase contracts  the company funds stated deposits in consideration for the right to purchase lots at a future point in time  usually at predetermined prices 
in accordance with the requirements of fin  certain of the company s lot option purchase contracts may result in the creation of a variable interest in a vie 
the company believes the accounting for joint ventures and land option purchase contracts using the variable interest consolidation methodology is a critical accounting policy because compliance with fin requires the use of complex judgment in its application 
income taxes the company calculates a provision for its income taxes by using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the company evaluates its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required 
in accordance with sfas  the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established based on its determination of whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends primarily on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
judgment is required in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements and or tax returns 
differences between the amounts recognized in its financial statements and or tax returns and actual outcomes may arise upon issuance of regulations and final guidance from federal and state taxing authorities 
these differences could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
share based payments effective january   the company follows the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which requires that compensation expense be measured and recognized at an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted under compensation arrangements 
the company calculates the fair value of stock options by using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior 
additionally  judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to forfeit 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and the company s consolidated results of operations could be materially impacted 
the company believes the accounting for stock based compensation is a critical accounting policy because it requires the use of complex judgment in its application 
outlook in  the company experienced a decline in sales orders for new homes  compared to the same period last year  due to severe economic conditions and broader market trends that contributed to soft demand for residential housing  as well as to a lower number of active communities resulting from company initiatives to react to such trends 
nearly all markets have been affected by reductions in the affordability of homes  the availability of mortgage products and consumer demand for homes  leading to persistent high levels of new and resale home inventories 
the company is prepared for prices and margins to remain under pressure for an extended period of time  knowing that additional volume declines  inventory impairments and land option contract abandonment could result  though potentially less in magnitude 
at december   the company s backlog of orders for new homes totaled  units  or a projected dollar value of million  reflecting a percent decrease in dollar value from december  recent activity by the federal government designed to stimulate the economy could improve demand  but the company is unable to predict when or whether this will occur 
as long as the imbalance of housing supply and demand continues  the company will not only remain focused on its liquidity and balance sheet  while seeking to optimize its operating performance  but also on positioning itself for a return to a more favorable economic environment
