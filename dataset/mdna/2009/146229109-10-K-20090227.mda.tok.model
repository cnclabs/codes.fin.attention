overview for more than years  carter s has become one of the most highly recognized and most trusted brand names in the children s apparel industry and with the acquisition of oshkosh on july   we now own the highly recognized and trusted oshkosh b gosh brand which also earned the position of a highly trusted and well known brand for over years 
we sell our products under our carter s and oshkosh brands in the wholesale channel  which includes over department store  national chain  and specialty store accounts 
we also sell our products in the mass channel under our child of mine brand to over  wal mart stores nationwide and under our just one year brand to over  target stores 
additionally  as of january   we operated carter s and oshkosh retail stores located primarily in outlet and strip centers throughout the united states 
we also extend our brand reach by licensing our carter s  child of mine  just one year  oshkosh  and related brand names through domestic licensing arrangements  including licensing of our genuine kids from oshkosh brand to target stores nationwide 
our oshkosh b gosh brand name is also licensed through international licensing arrangements 
during fiscal  we earned approximately million in royalty income from these arrangements  including million from our oshkosh and genuine kids from oshkosh brands 
in connection with the acquisition of oshkosh  we recorded cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired of million and an oshkosh brand tradename asset of million 
during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of the continued negative trends in sales and profitability of the company s oshkosh b gosh wholesale and retail segments and re forecasted projections for such segments for the balance of fiscal  the company conducted an interim impairment assessment on the value of the intangible assets that the company recorded in connection with the acquisition 
based on this assessment  charges of approximately million for the oshkosh wholesale segment and million for the oshkosh retail segment were recorded for the impairment of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired asset 
in addition  an impairment charge of million was recorded to reflect the impairment of the value ascribed to the oshkosh tradename 
the carrying value of the oshkosh tradename asset is subject to annual impairment reviews as of the last day of each fiscal year or more frequently if deemed necessary due to any significant events or changes in circumstances 
estimated future cash flows used in such impairment reviews could be negatively impacted if we do not achieve our sales plans and other assumptions that support the carrying value of these intangible assets  which could result in potential impairment of such assets 
we have also acquired certain definite lived intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of oshkosh comprised of licensing agreements and leasehold interests which resulted in annual amortization expense of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal amortization expense related to these intangible assets will be million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program  pursuant to which the company is authorized to purchase up to million of its outstanding common shares 
such repurchases may occur from time to time in the open market  in negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
this program has no time limit 
the timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management  based on its evaluation of market conditions  share price  and other factors 
during fiscal  the company repurchased and retired  shares  or approximately million  of its common stock at an average price of per share 
since inception of the program and through fiscal  the company repurchased and retired  shares  or approximately million  of its common stock at an average price of per share

for the fiscal years ended dollars in thousands january  of total december  of total net sales wholesale carter s wholesale oshkosh retail carter s retail oshkosh mass channel carter s total net sales carter s wholesale sales carter s brand wholesale sales increased million  or  in fiscal  to million 
the increase in carter s brand wholesale sales was driven by a increase in units shipped  partially offset by a decrease in average price per unit  as compared to fiscal the growth in units shipped was driven primarily by growth in all product categories due to increased demand and higher levels of off price units shipped 
the decrease in average price per unit was due to more competitive pricing in certain product categories  particularly to our off price customers 
oshkosh wholesale sales oshkosh brand wholesale sales decreased million  or  in fiscal to million 
the decrease in oshkosh brand wholesale sales reflects a decline in average price per unit  partially offset by a increase in units shipped  as compared to fiscal the decrease in average prices reflects a change in strategy to reposition the oshkosh brand to appeal to a broader consumer population 
we believe our new product offerings and price repositioning drove the increase in units shipped 
carter s retail stores carter s retail stores sales increased million  or  in fiscal to million 
the increase was driven by a comparable store sales increase of million  or based on locations  incremental sales of million generated by new store openings  partially offset by the impact of store closures of million 
during fiscal  on a comparable store basis  transactions increased  units per transaction increased  and average prices increased as compared to fiscal the increases in transactions and units per transaction were driven by strong product performance in all product categories  improved in store product presentation  and a focus on merchandising and marketing efforts 
the increase in average prices was driven by our baby  sleepwear  and other product categories  partially offset by decreased playwear product category pricing 
the company s comparable store sales calculations include sales for all stores that were open during the comparable fiscal period  including remodeled stores and certain relocated stores 
if a store relocates within the same center with no business interruption or material change in square footage  the sales for such store will continue to be included in the comparable store calculation 
if a store relocates to another center or there is a material change in square footage  such store is treated as a new store

the increase was driven by sales of million  or  of our just one year brand to target partially offset by a million  or  decrease in sales of our child of mine brand to wal mart 
the increase in just one year sales was driven primarily from new door growth and new floor space  particularly in playwear and baby 
the decrease in child of mine sales was due to product performance in certain categories  particularly certain spring products and certain fall hanging products 
we anticipate our mass channel sales could decline approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross profit our gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales reflects a higher relative percentage of sales from our carter s and oshkosh retail store segments  which generate higher gross profit margins than our other business segments 
in fiscal  our retail segments sales increased million  or 
partially offsetting these increases were i higher provisions for excess inventory of approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to declining market conditions  ii lower margins on child of mine products due to disappointing over the counter performance  and iii a decline in carter s and oshkosh brand wholesale margins due to price reductions

as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses in fiscal were as compared to in fiscal the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects i increase in our consolidated retail expenses from of retail store sales in fiscal to in fiscal  related primarily to new store openings and investments in our retail management team  and ii a provision for incentive compensation of million in fiscal as compared to no provision in fiscal partially offsetting these increases were i a decline in distribution costs as a percentage of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal resulting from supply chain efficiencies  and ii accelerated depreciation of million recorded in fiscal related to the closure of our oshkosh distribution facility 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating its overall cost structure in order to identify areas where costs can be reduced and operations can be run more efficiently

we believe increased promotional pricing drove the increase in unit volume 
average inventory levels  on a comparable store basis  were up as compared to fiscal we believe these higher average inventory levels helped drive our comparable store sales increases 
the company s comparable store sales calculations include sales for all stores that were open during the comparable fiscal period  including remodeled stores and certain relocated stores 
if a store relocates within the same center with no business interruption or material change in square footage  the sales for such store will continue to be included in the comparable store calculation

net loss income as a result of the factors above  we recorded a net loss for fiscal of million as compared to net income of million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our primary cash needs are working capital and capital expenditures 
our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolver  and we expect that these sources will fund our ongoing requirements for working capital and capital expenditures 
these sources of liquidity may be impacted by continued demand for our products and our ability to meet debt covenants under our senior credit facility  described below

since inception of the program and through fiscal  the company repurchased and retired  shares  or approximately million  of its common stock at an average price of per share 
at january   we had approximately million in term loan borrowings and no borrowings under our revolver  exclusive of million of outstanding letters of credit

weighted average borrowings for fiscal were million at an effective rate of as compared to weighted average borrowings of million at an effective rate of in fiscal the term of the revolver expires july  and the term of the term loan expires july  principal borrowings under the term loan are due and payable in quarterly installments of million from march  through june  with the remaining balance of million due on july  in fiscal and fiscal  we made scheduled amortization payments of million in each year 
the term loan has an applicable rate of libor  regardless of the company s overall leverage level 
interest is payable at the end of interest rate reset periods  which vary in length  but in no case exceed months for libor rate loans and quarterly for prime rate loans 
the effective interest rate on term loan borrowings as of january  and december  was and 
the senior credit facility contains and defines financial covenants  including a minimum interest coverage ratio  maximum leverage ratio  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
as of january   the company is in compliance with all debt covenants 
the senior credit facility also sets forth mandatory and optional prepayment conditions  including an annual excess cash flow requirement  as defined  that may result in our use of cash to reduce our debt obligations 
there was no excess cash flow payment required for fiscal or our obligations under the senior credit facility are collateralized by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets  including the assets of our domestic subsidiaries 
our senior credit facility requires us to hedge at least of our variable rate debt under the term loan 
on september   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to receive floating interest and pay fixed interest 
this interest rate swap agreement is designated as a cash flow hedge of the variable interest payments on a portion of our variable rate term loan debt 
the interest rate swap agreement matures on july  as of january   approximately million of our outstanding term loan debt was hedged under this agreement 
on may   we entered into an interest rate collar agreement with a floor of and a ceiling of 
the interest rate collar agreement covers million of our variable rate term loan debt and is designated as a cash flow hedge of the variable interest payments on such debt 
the interest rate collar agreement matures on january  on january   we entered into two interest rate swap agreements  each covering million of our variable rate term loan debt  to receive floating rate interest and pay fixed interest 
these swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges of the variable interest payments on a portion of our variable rate term loan debt 
these swap agreements mature in january our operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our senior credit facility  which carries variable interest rates 
as of january   our outstanding debt aggregated approximately million  of which million bore interest at a variable rate 
an increase or decrease of in the applicable rate would increase or decrease our annual interest cost by million  exclusive of variable rate debt subject to our swap and collar agreements  and could have an adverse effect on our net income loss and cash flow 
the following table summarizes as of january   the maturity or expiration dates of mandatory contractual obligations and commitments for the following fiscal years dollars in thousands thereafter total long term debt interest on debt variable rate a operating leases see note to the consolidated financial statements total financial obligations letters of credit purchase obligations b total financial obligations and commitments a reflects estimated variable rate interest on obligations outstanding on our term loan as of january  using an interest rate of rate in effect at january  
b unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the purchase obligations category above relates to commitments for inventory purchases 
amounts reflected on the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable or other current liabilities are excluded from the table above 
in addition to the total contractual obligations and commitments in the table above  we have post retirement benefit obligations and reserves for uncertain tax positions  included in other current and other long term liabilities as further described in note and note  respectively  to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash generated from operations and available cash  together with amounts available under our revolver  will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  capital expenditures  and working capital needs for the foreseeable future  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
we may  however  need to refinance all or a portion of the principal amount of amounts outstanding under our revolver on or before july  and amounts outstanding under our term loan on or before july  the continuing volatility in the financial markets and the related economic downturn in markets throughout the world could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we currently generate significant cash flows from our ongoing operations and have access to credit through amounts available under our revolver  credit markets have recently experienced significant disruptions and certain leading financial institutions have either declared bankruptcy or have shown significant deterioration in their financial stability 
further deterioration in the financial markets could make future financing difficult or more expensive 
if any of the financial institutions that are parties to our revolver were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent  they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us 
this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity 
in addition  tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers  contract manufacturers or trade customers and consequently  could disrupt our business 
effects of inflation and deflation we are affected by inflation and changing prices primarily through purchasing product from our global suppliers  increased operating costs and expenses  and fluctuations in interest rates 
the effects of inflation on our net sales and operations have not been material in recent years 
in recent years  there has been deflationary pressure on selling prices 
if deflationary price trends outpace our ability to obtain price reductions from our global suppliers  our profitability may be affected 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability  with generally lower sales and gross profit in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year 
over the past five fiscal years  excluding the impact of the oshkosh acquisition in fiscal  approximately of our consolidated net sales were generated in the second half of our fiscal year 
accordingly  our results of operations for the first and second quarters of any year are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year 
as a result of this seasonality  our inventory levels and other working capital requirements generally begin to increase during the second quarter and into the third quarter of each fiscal year 
during these peak periods  we had historically borrowed under our revolver 
in fiscal  we had no borrowings under our revolver 
in fiscal  we had million in peak borrowings under our revolver 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies and estimates  which are those policies that require management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize wholesale and mass channel revenue after shipment of products to customers  when title passes  when all risks and rewards of ownership have transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in certain cases  in which we retain the risk of loss during shipment  revenue recognition does not occur until the goods have reached the specified customer 
in the normal course of business  we grant certain accommodations and allowances to our wholesale and mass channel customers in order to assist these customers with inventory clearance or promotions 
such amounts are reflected as a reduction of net sales and are recorded based upon historical trends and annual forecasts 
retail store revenues are recognized at the point of sale 
we reduce revenue for customer returns and deductions 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments and other actual and estimated deductions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance could be required 
past due balances over days are reviewed individually for collectibility 
our credit and collections department reviews all other balances regularly 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we contract with a third party service to provide us with the fair value of cooperative advertising arrangements entered into with certain of our major wholesale and mass channel customers 
such fair value is determined based upon  among other factors  comparable market analysis for similar advertisements 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer reseller  we have included the fair value of these arrangements of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal as a component of selling  general  and administrative expenses on the accompanying audited consolidated statement of operations rather than as a reduction of revenue 
amounts determined to be in excess of the fair value of these arrangements are recorded as a reduction of net sales 
inventory we provide reserves for slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional write downs may be required 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired and tradename as of january   we had approximately million in carter s cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired and million of aggregate value related to the carter s and oshkosh tradename assets 
the fair value of the carter s tradename was estimated at the acquisition of carter s  inc by berkshire partners llc which was consummated on august   using a discounted cash flow analysis  which examined the hypothetical cost savings that accrue as a result of our ownership of the tradename 
the fair value of the oshkosh tradename was also estimated at its acquisition date using an identical discounted cash flow analysis 
the tradenames were determined to have indefinite lives 
the carrying values of these assets are subject to annual impairment reviews in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of the last day of each fiscal year 
factors affecting such impairment reviews include the continued market acceptance of our offered products and the development of new products 
impairment reviews may also be triggered by any significant events or changes in circumstances 
accrued expenses accrued expenses for workers compensation  incentive compensation  health insurance  and other outstanding obligations are assessed based on actual commitments  statistical trends  and estimates based on projections and current expectations  and these estimates are updated periodically as additional information becomes available 
loss contingencies we record accruals for various contingencies including legal exposures as they arise in the normal course of business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable 
our assessment is developed in consultation with our internal and external counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and can involve matters that are in litigation  which  by its nature is unpredictable 
we believe that our assessment of the probability of loss contingencies is reasonable  but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue  our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure state  federal  and foreign 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting dates 
for those uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
where applicable  associated interest is also recognized 
we also assess permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property  plant  and equipment  stock based compensation expense  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying audited consolidated statement of operations 
employee benefit plans we sponsor a defined benefit pension  defined contribution and other post retirement plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on the pension fund assets  and health care cost increase projections 
see note  employee benefits plans  to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further details on rates and assumptions 
stock based compensation arrangements the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method of transition 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include the following volatility this is a measure of the amount by which a stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate 
the company uses actual monthly historical changes in the market value of our stock since the company s initial public offering on october   supplemented by peer company data for periods prior to our initial public offering covering the expected life of stock options being valued 
an increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense 
risk free interest rate this is the us treasury rate as of the grant date having a term equal to the expected term of the stock option 
an increase in the risk free interest rate will increase compensation expense 
expected term this is the period of time over which the stock options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience and estimated future exercise behavior 
separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
an increase in the expected term will increase compensation expense 
dividend yield the company does not have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
an increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense 
forfeitures the company estimates forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the accompanying audited consolidated statement of operations 
the company accounts for its performance based awards in accordance with sfas r and records stock based compensation expense over the vesting term of the awards that are expected to vest based on whether it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved 
the company reassesses the probability of vesting at each reporting period for awards with performance criteria and adjusts stock based compensation expense based on its probability assessment 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas  business combinations sfas 
sfas r retains the underlying concepts of sfas in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting  but sfas r changed the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects 
acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
sfas r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december  sfas r amends sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of sfas r would also apply the provisions of sfas r 
early adoption is not permitted 
we have evaluated the impact that sfas r will have on our consolidated financial statements and have determined that it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency and interest rate risks in the operation of our business  we have market risk exposures including those related to foreign currency risk and interest rates 
these risks and our strategies to manage our exposure to them are discussed below 
we contract for production with third parties primarily in asia and south and central america 
while these contracts are stated in united states dollars  there can be no assurance that the cost for the future production of our products will not be affected by exchange rate fluctuations between the united states dollar and the local currencies of these contractors 
due to the number of currencies involved  we cannot quantify the potential impact of future currency fluctuations on net income loss in future years 
in order to manage this risk  we source products from approximately vendors worldwide  providing us with flexibility in our production should significant fluctuations occur between the united states dollar and various local currencies 
to date  such exchange fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we do not hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our senior credit facility  which carries variable interest rates 
as of january   our outstanding debt aggregated approximately million  of which million bore interest at a variable rate 
an increase or decrease of in the applicable rate would increase or decrease our annual interest cost by million  exclusive of variable rate debt subject to our interest rate swap and collar agreements  and could have an adverse effect on our net income loss and cash flow 
other risks we enter into various purchase order commitments with full package suppliers 
we can cancel these arrangements  although in some instances  we may be subject to a termination charge reflecting a percentage of work performed prior to cancellation 
as we rely exclusively on our full package global sourcing network  we could incur more of these termination charges  which could increase our cost of goods sold and have a material impact on our business
