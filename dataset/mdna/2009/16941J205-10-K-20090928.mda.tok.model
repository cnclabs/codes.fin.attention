introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of china precision steel  inc and our subsidiaries together  the group financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion is organized as follows 
overview of the company s business this section provides a general description of the group s business  as well as recent developments that have either occurred during the fiscal year ended june  and are important in understanding the results of operations and financial condition or disclose known trends 
results of operations this section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended june  this discussion includes a brief description of significant transactions and events that have an impact on the comparability of the results being analyzed 
liquidity and capital resources this section provides an analysis of the group s cash flows for the fiscal year ended june  included in this section is a discussion of the group s outstanding debt and the financial capacity available to fund the group s future commitments and obligations 
overview of our business we are a niche and high value added steel processing company principally engaged in the manufacture and sale of high precision cold rolled steel products  in the provision of heat treatment and in the cutting and slitting of medium and high carbon hot rolled steel strips 
we use commodity steel to create a high value added specialty premium steel 
specialty precision steel pertains to the precision of measurements and tolerances of thickness  shape  width  surface finish and other special quality features of highly engineered end use applications 
we produce and sell precision ultra thin and high strength cold rolled steel products ranging from mm to mm 
we also provide heat treatment and cutting and slitting of medium and high carbon hot rolled steel strips not exceeding mm thickness 
our process puts hot rolled de scaled pickled steel coils through a cold rolling mill  utilizing our patented systems and high technology reduction processing procedures  to make steel coils and sheets in customized thicknesses according to customer specifications 
currently  our specialty precision products are mainly used in the manufacture of automobile parts and components  steel roofing  plane friction discs  appliances  food packaging materials  saw blades  textile needles  and microelectronics 
we conduct our operations principally in the prc through our wholly owned operating subsidiaries  chengtong and shanghai blessford  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of our direct subsidiary  pshl 
our products are sold domestically in china as well as in overseas markets such as thailand  nigeria and ethiopia 
we intend to further expand into additional overseas markets in the future  subject to suitable market conditions and favorable regulatory controls 
fiscal financial performance highlights during the fiscal year  we saw slower demand and lower steel prices compared to last year as a result of the impact of the persisting global crisis 
there were decreases in order and sales volume over the year as we are faced with multiple challenges due to the global economic downturn 
we have seen weaker demands and reduced orders from existing customers  especially in the high carbon cold rolled steel segment  which are mainly used in auto components manufacturing  due to excess capacity and high inventory levels in the industry 
excess capacity  low industrial concentration and a lack of access to natural resources have long plagued china s steel sector  and these problems have been exacerbated by the impact of the global financial and economic crisis 
our two cold rolling mills are now operating at approximately utilization rate due to reduced orders on hand 
during the fiscal year ended june   we sold a total of  tons of products  a decrease of  tons from  tons a year ago  due to slower demand and reduced orders on hand 
we believe that such decrease was mainly caused by decreases in product orders from auto components manufacturers and from the chinese auto industry that experienced weak demand and excess capacity during the year ended june  lower sales and high raw material costs have led to a gross profit of  and a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended june  the rmb billion economic stimulus package formulated jointly by the chinese government s national development and reform commission and the ministry of industry and information technology in november is now planned to focus mainly on nine pillar industries  which include steel  automobiles  shipbuilding  petrochemicals  light industry  textiles  non ferrous metals  machinery  and information technology  all with serious production surpluses in the whole industrial system 
automobiles and steel sectors have been given priority and are the two main industries out of the nine pillars for which the government is expected to announce specific support packages and further details 
on january   china s state council approved a rejuvenation plan to support the steel industry  with the immediate aim to deal with the effects of the global financial and economic crisis and to also ease the industry s long term structural problems 
the steel industry plan includes eliminating obsolete capacity  speeding up innovation  promoting alliances and mergers and cutting export tariffs 
the government will also subsidize loans of about rmb billion to encourage technological upgrading and product rationalization to better meet demand 
although the series of measures adopted by the chinese government to promote economic growth have achieved some results  it is currently unclear whether and to what extent the economic stimulus measures and other actions taken or contemplated by the chinese government and other governments throughout the world will mitigate the effects of the crisis on the industries that affect our business 
we expect to continue to experience volatilities in demands in both domestic and international markets in the foreseeable future 
furthermore  deteriorating economic conditions  including business layoffs  downsizing  industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could have further negative consequences on our business operations 
for the foreseeable future  we expect a continuation of weak demand and volatility in both domestic and international markets across all product segments  and significantly adverse impacts on our gross margin due to a decrease in sales of our high margin high carbon cold rolled steel used mainly in auto components manufacturing 
however  due to the nature of our niche segment and high end products  we have been able to keep quality customers and negotiate new contracts with a total of new customers during the year 
management continues to be in talks with potential customers whose past orders we had been unable to fill due to full capacity 
if these talks are successful  we could see additional sales from a broadened customer base which would further mitigate the impact of the current global slowdown on our business and results of operations 
total company backlog as of june  was  we also continue to take appropriate actions to perform business and credit reviews of customers and suppliers and reduce exposure by avoiding entry into contracts with countries or customers with high credit risks 
we strive to optimize our product mix  prioritize higher margin products  and strengthen collection of accounts receivable in the existing business environment with the goal to maintain overall healthy sales volume  margins and cash positions 
we believe that there are high barriers to entry in the chinese domestic precision cold rolled steel industry because of the level of technology expertise required for operation 
although we continue to face volatilities in demand and overall steel industry  the medium to long term prospects remain highly optimistic and we believe that our unique capabilities and know how give us a competitive advantage to grow sales and build a globally recognized brand as we continue to carry out r d and expand to new segments  customers and markets 
the following are some financial highlights for the fiscal year revenues our revenues were approximately million for the fiscal year  a decrease of from last year 
gross margin gross margin was for the fiscal year  as compared to in income loss from operations before tax loss from operations before tax was approximately million for the fiscal year  as compared to income from operations before tax of million last year 
net income loss net loss was approximately million for the fiscal year  a decrease of from a net income of approximately million last year 
fully diluted income loss per share fully diluted loss per share was for the fiscal year compared to a fully diluted earnings per share of last year 
taxation united states china precision steel  inc is incorporated in the state of delaware and is subject the tax laws of united states at a tax rate of 
no provision for income taxes in the united states has been made as china precision steel  inc incurred no taxable income for federal tax purposes 
in addition  no deferred tax on undistributed earnings of its non us subsidiaries was provided  as it is our current policy to reinvest these earnings in non us operations 
british virgin islands pshl and blessford international were incorporated in the bvi  and  under the current laws of the bvi  are not subject to income taxes 
prc on march   the national people s congress of china passed the enterprise income tax law  or the new eit law  and on december   the state council of china passed the implementing rules for the eit law  or the implementing rules  which took effect on january  the new eit law and implementing rules impose a unified enterprise income tax  or eit  of on all domestic invested enterprises and foreign invested entities  or fies  unless they qualify under certain limited exceptions 
therefore  nearly all fies are subject to the new tax rate alongside other domestic businesses rather than benefiting from the old fie tax laws  and its associated preferential tax treatments  beginning january  the new eit law gives the fies established before march   or old fies  a five year grandfather period during which they can continue to enjoy their existing preferential tax treatment 
during this five year grandfather period  the old fies which enjoyed tax rates lower than under the original tax law shall gradually increase their enterprise income tax rate by per year until the tax rate reaches 
in addition  the old fies that are eligible for the two year exemption and three year half reduction or five year exemption and five year half reduction under the original tax law  are allowed to remain to enjoy their preference until these holidays expire 
chengtong has been entitled to preferential tax advantages in china  including full tax exemption on the enterprise income tax that was generated in the first two years after the recoveries of previous losses and a one half reduction in the prevailing enterprise income tax rate for the next years 
the full tax exemption for the enterprise income tax expired on december  and the right to a one half reduction on the enterprise income tax expired on december  chengtong is therefore subject to the income tax rate from january  shanghai blessford has also been entitled to preferential tax advantages in china  including full tax exemption on the enterprise income tax that was generated in the first two years after the recoveries of previous losses and a one half reduction in the prevailing enterprise income tax rate for the next years 
the full tax exemption for the enterprise income tax will expire on december  and the right to a one half reduction on the enterprise income tax will expire on december  shanghai blessford will therefore be subject to or one half of the prevailing tax rate from december  until december  substantially all of our income may be derived from dividends we receive from our prc operating subsidiaries described above 
the new eit law and its implementing rules generally provide that a withholding tax applies to china sourced income derived by non resident enterprises for prc enterprise income tax purposes 
we expect that such withholding tax will apply to dividends paid to us by our prc subsidiaries  but this treatment will depend on our status as a non resident enterprise 
for detailed discussion of prc tax issues related to resident enterprise status  see risk factors risks related to doing business in china under the new eit law  we may be classified as a resident enterprise of china 
such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non prc shareholders 
results of operations the following table sets forth key components of our results of operations for the years ended june   and and as a percentage of revenues 
all amounts in us dollars amount of revenues amount of revenues amount of revenues revenues cost of sales including depreciation and amortization gross profit selling and marketing administrative expenses allowance for bad and doubtful debts depreciation and amortization loss income from continuing operations other income interest and finance costs income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes net income loss before discontinued operations net income from discontinued operations net loss income basic earnings loss per share from continuing operations from discontinued operations total diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations from discontinued operations total fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  sales revenues 
sales volume decreased by  tons  or  year on year to  tons for the year ended june  from  tons for the year ended june  and  as a result  sales revenues decreased by  or  year on year to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  the decrease in sales revenues is mainly attributable to a decrease in demand for high carbon cold rolled products used in automobile components production due to the slowdown of the automobile industry  as well as lower average sale prices during the year ended june  sales by product line a break down of our sales by product line for the years ended june  and is as follows year on year product category quantity tons amount of sales quantity tons amount of sales qty 
variance low carbon hard rolled low carbon cold rolled high carbon hot rolled high carbon cold rolled subcontracting income sales of scrap metal total there were different trends of demand across various product categories during the year ended june  high carbon cold rolled steel products only accounted for of the current sales mix at an average selling price of  per ton for the year ended june   compared to of the sales mix at an average selling price per ton of  for the year ended june  this was a result of the slow down of the automobile industry as a large quantity of the products in this category is sold to automobile components manufacturers 
low carbon cold rolled steel products accounted for of the current sales mix at an average selling price of per ton for the year ended june   compared to of the sales mix at an average selling price per ton of for the year ended june  low carbon hard rolled steel products accounted for of the current sales mix at an average selling price of  per ton for the year ended june   compared to of the sales mix at an average selling price per ton of for the year ended june  subcontracting income revenues decreased slightly to  or  of the sales mix for the year ended june  as compared to  or  of the sales mix during the year ended june  variance average selling prices low carbon hard rolled low carbon cold rolled high carbon hot rolled high carbon cold rolled subcontracting income the average selling price per ton decreased to for the year ended june   compared to the corresponding year in of  representing a decrease of  or  year on year 
this decrease was mainly due to decreases in steel prices and therefore selling prices due to volatilities in the industry  as well as a decrease in percentage of high carbon cold rolled steel products during the year 
high carbon cold rolled steel products have the highest selling prices among all product categories  and only accounted for of the current sales mix  compared to of the sales mix year on year 
there was also been a decrease in the average selling price of high carbon cold rolled steel products to  per ton for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  sales breakdown by major customer customers of sales of sales salzgitter mannesmann international gmbh shanghai changshuo stainless steel co  ltd

others total not major customers for the relevant years sales revenues generated from our top five major customers as a percentage of total sales decreased to for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june  sales to two new major customers  salzgitter mannesmann international gmbh and shanghai changshuo stainless steel co  ltd  for the year accounted for of our sales revenues 
the change in customer mix reflects management s continuous efforts in expanding our customer base and geographical coverage during the course of the year 
cost of goods sold 
cost of sales increased by  or  year on year to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  cost of sales represented of sales revenues for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  average cost of production per ton increased to for the year ended june   compared to an average cost of production per ton of for the year ended june   representing an increase of per ton  or  year on year 
variance cost of goods sold raw materials direct labor manufacturing overhead cost per unit sold total units sold tons average cost per unit sold ton the increase in cost of sales is represented by the combined effect of an increase in cost of raw materials per unit sold of  or  from for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june   an increase in direct labor per unit sold of  or  from for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june an increase in factory overhead per unit sold of  or  from for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  the cost of raw materials consumed increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  this increase was mainly due to increases in raw material prices year on year  offset by decrease in total units sold 
direct labor costs increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  the increase was due to increases in wages during the year following the lifting of the minimum monthly wage in shanghai  as well as increases in related pension costs resulting from the additional base wages 
manufacturing overhead costs increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  the increase was mainly attributable to the combined effect of an increase in depreciation of  or  year on year to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june   an increase in utilities of  or  year on year to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  due to increased consumption of natural gas associated with the production of  additional tons of low carbon hard rolled steel year on year  and an increase in low consumables by  or  year on year to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  gross profit 
gross profit in absolute terms decreased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june   while gross profit margin decreased to for the year ended june   from for the year ended june  the decrease in gross profit is mainly attributable to a year on year decrease in sales revenues  as well as a year on year increase in cost of goods sold 
the decrease in gross profit margin principally resulted from the higher cost per ton sold of raw materials as we are taking down raw materials from inventories we purchased some time ago at higher prices during restricted supplies  as well as a decrease in average selling prices due to the decrease in steel prices during the fiscal year 
selling expenses 
selling expenses increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june  compared to the corresponding year in of  the increase was mainly attributable to increases in sales commission paid to export agents based on increased tonnage exported during the year  and transportation and custom clearing charges in relation to such export sales year on year 
our export precision products  the low carbon hard rolled steel  accounted for  or  of the sales mix for the year ended june   compared to  or of sales during the year ended june  administrative expenses 
administrative expenses decreased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june  compared to  for the year ended june  this decrease was chiefly associated with lower sec compliance costs and professional fees as there was no financing activity during the year ended june  and lower legal and advisory fees as we become more familiar with the rules and regulations as a listed company 
provision for bad debt 
provision for bad debt increased by  or  year on year  because of bad debt expense in the amount of  recognized during the year 
this charge reflects a provision for doubtful accounts due to a dispute between the company and one of our customers regarding a special stainless steel product processed by the company and delivered to the customer during the third and fourth quarters of the year ended june  revenues for these products were initially recognized as services had been rendered and goods had been delivered in accordance to the terms of the contract  collectability was reasonably assured and management had no reason to believe that the customer would object to the goods and services provided 
however  in the months following such delivery  a dispute arose during the use of such products by the customer  which was followed by discussions between the company and the customer regarding the technical aspects of the products and the possibility of reprocessing 
after a few rounds of negotiation with the customer regarding the products and payment  our management determined that this accounts receivable was uncollectible 
the company does not have any other accounts receivable related to this product 
income from operations 
income from operations before income tax decreased by  or  year on year to a loss of  for the year ended june  from income of  for the year ended june   as a result of the factors discussed above 
other revenues 
our other income decreased  or  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  as a percentage of revenues  other income decreased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  such percentage decrease in other income was primarily due to lower cash balances and decrease in interest rate year on year 
interest expense 
total interest expense decreased  or  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  due to an increase in loan balances offset by a lower weighted average interest rate year on year 
income tax 
for the year ended june   we recognized income tax expense of  compared to an income tax expense of  for the year ended june  other than a lower income from operations year on year  the income tax expense for the year ended june  reflects a reversal of deferred tax liabilities in the amount of  which had substantially decreased the total income tax expense for the year 
net income loss 
net income decreased by  or  year on year  to a net loss of  for the year ended june  from net income of  for the year ended june  the decrease in net income is attributable to a combination of factors discussed above  including a decrease in tons of goods sold due to weakened demand amid the current global economic downturn  which in turn led to a decrease in sales revenue  and lower average selling prices year on year 
the decrease in net income is also attributable to a decrease in gross margin  largely due to higher raw material costs and the recognition of a  bad debt expense for the year ended june  fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  sales revenues 
sales volume increased by  tons  or  year on year to  tons for the year ended june  from  tons for the year ended june  and  as a result  sales revenues increased by  or  year on year to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  we believe that the increases in sales and sales revenues are a direct result of increases in our capacity and the building of our brand both in china and overseas among users of cold rolled precision steel products 
average cost per unit sold increased to for the year ended june   compared to an average cost per unit sold of for the year ended june   representing an increase of per ton  or  year on year 
the increase in average cost per unit sold is mainly attributable to the increase in raw material prices 
sales by product line 
a break down of our sales by product line for the years ended june  and is as follows year on year product category quantity tons amount of sales quantity tons amount of sales qty 
variance low carbon cold rolled low carbon acid wash low carbon hard rolled high carbon cold rolled high carbon hot rolled high end cold rolled sales of scrap metal subcontracting income total there were various changes in the break down of sales among our product categories over the year ended june  as we have been ramping up the capacity of the second mill since october and are in the process of developing new products and new markets 
high carbon cold rolled steel products accounted for of the sales mix at an average selling price of  per ton for the year ended june  compared to of the sales mix at an average selling price per ton of  for the year ended june   as we continued to see our customers of the high carbon hot rolled products switch to the high carbon cold rolled products 
the low carbon cold rolled steel products accounted for of the sales mix at an average selling price of per ton for the year ended june  compared to of the sales mix at an average selling price per ton of for the year ended june  this is a result of increased production of the low carbon hard rolled steel category  which is our exported precision steel product  from of sales during the year ended june  accounting for  to of the sales mix  accounting for  at an average selling price of per ton for the year ended june  variance average selling prices low carbon cold rolled low carbon acid wash low carbon hard rolled high carbon cold rolled high carbon hot rolled high end cold rolled subcontracting income the average selling price per ton generated increased to for the year ended june  compared to the corresponding year in of  representing an increase of  or  year on year 
this increase was due to both changes in our sales mix during the year to focus on high quality high margin products and rising raw material prices

average cost per unit sold produced increased by  or  year on year  to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  manufacturing overhead costs increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  this increase was mainly attributable to the combined effect of an increase in low consumables by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june   an increase in depreciation by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june   and an increase in utilities by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  gross profit 
gross profit in absolute terms increased by  or  year on year to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june   while gross profit margin decreased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  the increase in gross profit is mainly attributable to a year on year increase in sales revenues in relation to a year on year increase in cost of goods sold 
the decrease in gross profit margin principally resulted from increases of raw material prices during the year 
we passed on the majority of the increased cost to our customers through increases in selling prices 
selling expenses 
selling expenses increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   compared to the corresponding year in of  the increase was mainly attributable to increases in transportation  which rose by  or  year on year  to  due to our increased sales volume of export products and related delivery charges 
administrative expenses 
administrative expenses increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   compared to the comparable year in this was chiefly due to increases in listing and compliance fees after our admission to the nasdaq capital market in december  directors remuneration  traveling expenses and salaries and wages 
increases in salaries and wages were principally due to increases in the average number of staff at our operating subsidiaries 
finance costs 
net finance cost increased year on year as a result of increases in total interest expense by  the increases in net interest expenses were due a decrease in capitalized interest of  year on year and increases in interest rates during the year 
net income 
net income increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  the increase in net income is mainly attributable to the increase in sales during the year  due to increased production capacity 
liquidity and capital resources general our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for  among other things  the purchase and maintenance of plant and equipment used in our operations 
our short term and long term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures  working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness 
we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations  equity financing  and bank debt 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
the following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods presented in this report cash flow year ended june  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash flow operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended june  was  as compared with  used in operating activities for the year ended june   for a net increase of  this increase was mainly due to reduction in cash flows to advances to suppliers of  as compared with a cash outflow in the amount of  to advances to suppliers during the year ended june   we made less advances during the current year and received approximately million of cash refund of an advance made to one of our major suppliers 
the increase in operating cash flows was also attributed to a substantial increase in cash flows from accounts receivable of  due to strengthened collection activities during the year  offset by decreases from accounts payable and advances from customers during the year ended june for the year ended june   sales revenues generated from the top five major customers as a percentage of total sales decreased to as compared to for the year ended june  the loss of all or portion of the sales volume from a significant customer would have an adverse effect on our operating cash flows 
while our operating cash flows from accounts receivable substantially increased year on year  days sales outstanding also increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  as we have experienced delays in customer payment 
we note that the continuation or intensification of the current worldwide economic crisis may have negative consequences on the business operations of our customers and adversely impact their ability to meet their financial obligations to us  resulting in unrecoverable losses on such accounts receivable 
we have been strengthening our collection activities and will continue to closely monitor any changes in collection experience and the credit ratings of our customers 
from time to time we will review credit periods offered  along with our collection experience and the other relevant factors  to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  and to make changes to the allowance  if necessary 
delays or non payment of accounts receivable would have an adverse effect on our operating cash flows 
investing activities our main uses of cash for investing activities during the year ended june  were for the purchase of property  plant and equipment related to the addition of a new cold rolling mill and annealing furnaces at our shanghai blessford facilities 
we believe these capital investments increase our capacity  expand product line and improve product qualities  thereby creating opportunities to grow sales  enter new markets and further strengthen our leading position in the niche cold rolling segment that we operate in 
net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended june  was  as compared with  for the year ended june  the increase in investing activity was due to payment of the construction project related to the new mm cold rolling mill and a deposit made relating to the construction of annealing furnaces during the year ended june  as of june   the company had  in commitments for capital expenditures for construction projects mentioned above 
management believes that we currently have sufficient capital resources to meet these contractual commitments and expect to complete the trial production of the new mill by end of calendar we also forecast lower capital expenditures in the coming years as by now the company has completed most of its expansion plans and the majority of the construction costs relating to our third cold rolling mill has already been paid for as at june  financing activities net cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended june  was  as compared with  provided by financing activities for the year ended june  during the year ended june   the company received short term loans of  and net proceeds from the exercise of warrants of  which was partially offset by repayment of short term loans in the amount of  the year ended june  reflects net proceeds of approximately million from an offering of the company s common stock  and repayment and renewing of short term loans which offset each other 
on december   we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec 
the shelf registration  when declared effective  will permit us to issue securities valued at up to an aggregate of million 
once effective  we will have the flexibility to issue registered securities  from time to time  in one or more separate offerings or other transactions with the size  price and terms to be determined at the time of issuance 
although we do not have any commitments or current intentions to sell securities under the registration statement  we believe that it is prudent to have a shelf registration statement in place to ensure financing flexibility should the need arise 
while we currently generate sufficient operating cash flows to support our working capital requirements  our working capital requirements and the cash flow provided by future operating activities will vary from quarter to quarter  and are dependent on factors such as volume of business and payment terms with our customers 
as such  we may need to rely on access to the financial markets to provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity 
however  the current uncertainty arising out of domestic and global economic conditions  including the recent disruption in credit markets  poses a risk to the economies in which we operate and may adversely impact our potential sources of capital financing 
the general unavailability of credit could make capital financing more expensive for us or impossible altogether 
even if we are able to obtain credit  the incurrence of indebtedness could result in increased debt service obligations 
our inability to renew our current bank debt that is due in july  and the unavailability of additional debt financing as a result of economic pressures on the credit and equity markets could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 
current assets current assets decreased by  or  year on year to  as of june   from  as of june   principally as a result of a decrease in accounts receivable of  or  year on year  as a result of strengthened efforts in credit collection during the year  cash and cash equivalents by  or  year on year  advances to suppliers of  or  year on year  and inventories of  or  year on year  offset by an increase in bills receivable of  or  year on year 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is mainly attributable to payment in relation to the construction cost of the additional rolling mill and annealing furnaces during the year ended june  accounts receivable  representing of total current assets as of june   is a significant asset of the company 
we offer credit to our customers in the normal course of our business and accounts receivable is stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
credit periods vary substantially across industries  segments  types and size of companies in china where we operate our business 
because of the niche products that we process  our customers are usually also niche players in their own respective segment  who then sell their products to the end product manufacturers 
the business cycle is relatively long  as well as the credit periods 
the company offers credit to its customers for periods of days  days  days and days 
we generally offer the longer credit terms to longstanding recurring customers with good payment histories and sizable operations 
from time to time we review these credit periods  along with our collection experience and the other factors discussed above  to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  and to make changes to the allowance  if necessary 
if our actual collection experience or other conditions change  revisions to our allowances may be required  including a further provision which could adversely affect our operating income  or write back of provision when estimated uncollectible accounts are actually collected 
our management determines the collectability of outstanding accounts by maintaining quarterly communication with such customers and obtaining confirmation of their intent to fulfill their obligations to the company 
in making this determination  our management also considers past collection experience  our relationship with customers and the impact of current economic conditions on our industry and market 
we note that the continuation or intensification of the current global economic crisis may have negative consequences on the business operations of our customers and adversely impact their ability to meet their financial obligations 
to reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable  for the year ended june   our management has made a provision for all accounts receivable that are over days past due and full provision for all accounts receivable over one year past due 
from time to time  we will review these credit periods  along with our collection experience and the other factors discussed above  to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  and to make changes to the allowance  if necessary 
if our actual collection experience or other conditions change  revisions to our allowances may be required  including a further provision which could adversely affect our operating income  or write back of provision when estimated uncollectible accounts are actually collected 
the following table reflects the aging of our accounts receivable as of june  and june  us total current to days to days to days to days over year total june  us total current to days to days to days to days over year total management continues to take appropriate actions to perform business and credit reviews of any prospective customers whether new or returning to protect the company from any who might pose a high credit risk to our business based on their commercial credit reports  our past collection history with them  and our perception of the risk posed by their geographic location 
for example  we have halted all our sales transactions directly with customers in the philippines as we consider the associated credit risk to be relatively high 
based on publicly available reports  such as that issued by am best  there is a high risk that financial volatility may erupt in that country due to inadequate reporting standards  a weak banking system or asset markets and or poor regulatory structure 
we expect to resume such exports when conditions improve 
management is also of the opinion that we do not currently have any high risk receivables on our accounts 
current liabilities current liabilities decreased by  or  year on year  to  as of june   from  as of june  the decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in advances from customers of  or  year on year  and a decrease in accounts payable of  or  year on year  offset by an increase in short term loans of  or  year on year 
as of june   we had  in short term loans 
these short term loans have been renewed in july for one year and will be due on july  we expect to refinance such debt at its maturity  but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on terms favorable to the company or at all 
capital expenditures during the year ended june   we invested  in purchases of property  plant and equipment  and construction projects in relation to the new cold rolling mill and annealing furnaces 
loan facilities the following table illustrates our credit facilities as of june   providing the name of the lender  the amount of the facility  the date of issuance and the maturity date all amounts in us dollars lender date of loan maturity date duration interest rate principal amount raiffeisen zentralbank sterreich ag rzb july  july  year usd sibor  rmb times of the pboc rate rmb  raiffeisen zentralbank sterreich ag july  july  year times of the pboc rate rmb  total as of june   we had  in short term loans as illustrated in the above table 
the above loans have been renewed at an interest rate of times of the standard market rate set by the people s bank of china  or pboc  for renminbi loans and at sibor plus for usd loans  for one year due on july  and are secured by land use rights  buildings  plant and machineries  and guaranteed by pshl and mr 
li wo hing 
we are not aware of any existing issues that may lead to a withdrawal of these loans that are due and renewable in july our inability to renew  and the unavailability of debt financing due to credit market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 
we believe that our currently available working capital and the credit facilities referred to above should be adequate to sustain our operations at our current levels and support our contractual commitments through the next twelve months 
however  our working capital requirements and the cash flow provided by future operating activities vary from quarter to quarter  depending on the volume of business during the period and payment terms with our customers 
as we expect a continuation of weak demand and volatility in both domestic and international markets in the foreseeable future  especially the higher margin low carbon cold rolled exported products and the high carbon cold rolled products that are sold to the auto industry  our operating cash flows might be significantly negatively impacted by such reduced sales and margins 
management has strengthened its sales and marketing activities  and continues to be in talks with potential customers whose past orders we had been unable to fill due to full capacity  which if successful  could result in additional sales and mitigate the impact of the weakened demand and margins on our operating cash flow 
as of june   the company also had  in contractual commitments for capital expenditures related to the expansion of our production facilities 
as such  we may need to rely on access to the financial markets to provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity 
however  the current uncertainty arising out of domestic and global economic conditions  including the recent disruption in credit markets  poses a risk to the economies in which we operate and may adversely impact our potential sources of capital financing 
the general unavailability of credit could make capital financing more expensive for us or impossible altogether 
even if we are able to obtain credit  the incurrence of indebtedness could result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that could restrict our present and future operations 
obligations under material contracts below is a table setting forth our material contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period contractual obligations total fiscal year fiscal years fiscal years fiscal year and beyond short term debt obligations construction commitments total recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  recently issued the following standards which the company reviewed to determine the potential impact on our financial statements upon adoption

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements  including the notes thereto  and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies  if any 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements  including the following functional currency and translating financial statements the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our functional currency is chinese renminbi  however  the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been expressed in usd 
the consolidated balance sheets have been translated into usd at the exchange rates prevailing at each balance sheet date 
the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows have been translated using the weighted average exchange rates prevailing during the periods of each statement 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognized on the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership  which generally coincides with the time when the goods are delivered to customers and the title has passed and services have been rendered and invoiced 
revenue is reported net of all vat taxes 
other income is recognized when it is earned 
accounts receivable credit periods vary substantially across industries  segments  types and size of companies in china where we operate our business 
because of the niche products that we process  our customers are usually also niche players in their own respective segment  who then sell their products to end product manufacturers 
the business cycle is relatively long  as well as credit periods 
the company offers credit to its customers for periods of days  days  days and days 
we generally offer the longer credit terms to longstanding recurring customers with good payment histories and sizable operations 
accounts receivable is recorded at the time revenue is recognized and is stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the collectability of the accounts receivable 
management determines the collectability of outstanding accounts by maintaining regular communication with such customers and obtaining confirmation of their intent to fulfill their obligations to the company 
management also considers past collection experience  our relationship with customers and the impact of current economic conditions on our industry and market 
however  we note that the continuation or intensification of the current global economic crisis may have negative consequences on the business operations of our customers and adversely impact their ability to meet their financial obligations 
at june   approximately of our accounts receivable were past due over days 
to reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable  for the year ended june   our management has made a provision for all accounts receivable that are over days past due and full provision for all accounts receivable over one year past due 
from time to time  we will review these credit periods  along with our collection experience and the other factors discussed above  to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  and to make changes to the allowance  if necessary 
if our actual collection experience or other conditions change  revisions to our allowances may be required  including a further provision which could adversely affect our operating income  or write back of provision when estimated uncollectible accounts are actually collected 
at june  and  the company had  and  of allowances for doubtful accounts  respectively 
bad debts are written off for past due balances over two years or when it becomes known to management that such amount is uncollectible 
provision for bad debts recognized for the year ended june  and were  and  respectively 
the current year charge reflects a provision for doubtful accounts due to a dispute between the company and one of our customers regarding a special stainless steel product processed by the company and delivered to the customer during the third and fourth quarters of the year ended june  revenues for these products were initially recognized as services had been rendered and goods had been delivered in accordance to the terms of the contract  collectability was reasonably assured and management had no reason to believe that the customer would object to the goods and services provided 
however  in the months following such delivery  a dispute arose during the use of such products by the customer  which was followed by discussions between the company and the customer regarding the technical aspects of the products and the possibility of reprocessing 
after a few rounds of negotiation with the customer regarding the products and payment  our management determined that this accounts receivable was uncollectible 
the company does not have any other accounts receivable related to this product 
our management is continually working to ensure that any known uncollectible amounts are immediately written off as bad debt against outstanding balances 
advances to suppliers in order to insure a steady supply of raw materials  the company is required from time to time to make cash advances to its suppliers when placing purchase orders  for a guaranteed minimum delivery quantity at future times when raw materials are required 
the advance is seen as a deposit to suppliers and guarantees our access to raw materials during periods of shortages and market volatility  and is therefore considered an important component of our operations 
contracted raw materials are priced at prevailing market rates agreed by us with the suppliers prior to each delivery date 
advances to suppliers are shown net of an allowance which represents potentially unrecoverable cash advances at each balance sheet date 
such allowances are based on an analysis of past raw materials receipt experience and the credibility of each supplier according to its size and background 
in general  we don t provide allowances against advances paid to state owned companies as there is minimal risk of default 
our allowances for advances to suppliers are subjective critical estimates that have a direct impact on reported net earnings  and are reviewed quarterly at a minimum to reflect changes from our historic raw material receipt experience and to ensure the appropriateness of the allowance in light of the circumstances present at the time of the review 
it is reasonably possible that the company s estimate of the allowance will change  such as in the case when the company becomes aware of a supplier s inability to deliver the contracted raw materials or meet its financial obligations 
at june  and  the company had allowances for advances to suppliers of  and  respectively 
during the year ended june   we have received a million cash refund of our advances of over days to suppliers  from one of our major suppliers 
the majority of the remaining advances to suppliers of over days is attributable to our advances to a subsidiary of a state owned company in china  whose risk of default is minimal 
at june   this supplier has confirmed to our management that it is committed to delivering the contracted raw materials as and when those are needed by the company 
allowances for advances to suppliers are written off when all efforts to collect the materials or recover the cash advances have been unsuccessful  or when it has become known to the management that there is no intention for the suppliers to deliver the contracted raw materials or refund the cash advances 
to date we have not written off any advances to suppliers 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the weighted average method 
intangible assets intangible assets represent land use rights in china acquired by the company and are stated at cost less amortization 
amortization of land use rights is calculated on the straight line method  based on the period over which the right is granted by the relevant authorities in china 
the company acquired land use rights in august and december for years that both expire in december the land use rights are amortized over a fifty year term 
an amortization amount of approximately  is to be recorded each year starting from the current financial year ending june  for the remaining lease period 
intangible assets of the company are reviewed for impairment if there are triggering events  to determine whether their carrying value has become impaired  in conformity with sfas no 
the company also re evaluates the periods of amortization to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives 
an impairment test was performed as of june  and no impairment charges were recognized for the relevant periods 
as of june   the company expects these assets to be fully recoverable 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the cost of an asset comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its present working condition and location for its intended use 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets for financial reporting purposes 
the estimated useful lives for significant property and equipment are as follows buildings years plant and machinery years motor vehicles years office equipment to years repairs and maintenance costs are normally charged to the statement of operations in the year in which they are incurred 
in situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditure has resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of the asset  the expenditure is capitalized as an additional cost of the asset 
the company accounts for impairment of propery  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires the company to evaluate a long lived asset for recoverability when there is an event or circumstance that indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we determine such impairment by measuring the estimated undiscounted future cash flow generated by the assets  comparing the result to the asset carrying value and adjusting the asset to the lower of its carrying value or fair value and charging current operations for the measured impairment 
where the recoverable amount of any property  plant and equipment is determined to have declined below its carrying amount  the carrying amount is reduced to reflect the decline in value 
we performed an impairment test as of june   using a normal and a worse case scenario  and assessed fair value based on average tons sold  selling price per ton  gross margin  and other cash inflows and outflows for the next ten years where our mills are expected to remain in operation 
no impairment charges were recognized for the relevant year 
assumptions and estimates used in our impairment test provide the general direction of major factors expected to affect our business and cash flows  and are subject to risks and uncertainties such as changes in interest rates  industry cyclicality  and factors surrounding the general chinese and global economies 
those estimates will be reassessed for their reasonableness at each impairment test 
other policies other accounting policies used by the company are set forth in the notes accompanying our financial statements 
seasonality our operating results and operating cash flows historically have been subject to seasonal variations 
our revenues are usually higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year and the first quarter is usually the slowest quarter because fewer projects are undertaken during and around the chinese new year holidays 
off balance sheet arrangements for the year ended june   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to several types of market risk changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes nor do we make use of derivative instruments to hedge the risks discussed below 
the following sections provide quantitative information on our exposure to market risks 
our use of sensitivity analyses are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions 
foreign currency exchange rates we collect revenues from operations principally in the chinese renminbi 
except for export contracts denominated in us dollars  all of our sales revenues are collected in and substantially all of our expenses are paid in the chinese renminbi 
we face foreign currency rate translation risk when our results are translated to us dollars  as well as foreign currency rate transaction risk with respect to sales outside of china and with respect to financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies 
our results of operations denominated in foreign currency are translated at the average rate of exchange during the reporting period 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the market rate of exchange ruling at that date 
the registered equity capital denominated in the functional currency is translated at the historical rate of exchange at the time of capital contribution 
the chinese renminbi had remained stable against the us dollar at approximately yuan to us dollar for several years and it was not until july  that the chinese currency regime was altered  with a revaluation versus the united states dollar 
this move initially valued the renminbi at per united states dollar 
in addition  the renminbi is no longer linked to the us currency but rather to a basket of currencies with a margin of fluctuation 
however  there remains international pressure on the chinese government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy and as of june  the exchange rate was yuan to us dollar 
the exchange rate of renminbi is subject to changes in china s government policies which are  to a large extent  dependent on the economic and political development both internationally and locally and the demand and supply of renminbi in the domestic market 
there can be no assurance that such exchange rate will continue to remain stable in the future amongst the volatility of currencies  globalization and the unstable economies in recent years 
since i our income and profit are mainly denominated in renminbi  and ii the payment of dividends will be in us dollars  if any  any exchange fluctuation of the renminbi against other foreign currencies would adversely affect the value of the shares and dividends payable to shareholders  in foreign currency terms 
at june   the group s outstanding financial instruments with foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure had an aggregate fair value of million including the group s non us dollar denominated debt 
the potential increase in the fair values of these instruments resulting from a adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million at june  interest rates we are subject to interest rate risk on its non derivative financial instruments 
we do not hedge our interest rate risk 
at june   our total bank debt outstanding was  all of which was interest bearing 
substantially all of the bank debt was floating rate debt with interest rates which vary with changes in the standard rate set by the people s bank of china 
a change in the interest rate or yield of fixed rate debt will only impact the fair value of such debt  while a change in the interest rate of floating rate  or variable rate  debt will impact interest expense as well as the amount of cash required to service such debt 
to the extent interest rates increase  we will be liable for higher interest payments to our lenders 
for the fiscal year ending june   annual interest on loans is anticipated to be approximately million 
the impact of a increase in interest rates will increase interest expense by approximately  as our short term loans mature  we will be required to either repay or refinance these loans 
an increase in short term interest rates at the time that we seek to refinance these short term loans may increase the cost of borrowing  which may adversely affect our earnings and cash available for distribution to shareholders 
at june   the aggregate fair value of the group s financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately million 
the potential change in fair value for these financial instruments from an adverse change in quoted interest rates across all maturities  often referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve  would be approximately million at june  commodity prices the steel coils and other raw materials used by the company require large amounts of raw materials iron ore or other iron containing material  steel scrap  coke and coal as well as large amounts of energy to produce 
additionally  we also use large amounts of energy in our operations 
over the last several years  prices for raw materials and energy  in particular natural gas and oil  have increased significantly 
in many cases these price increases have been at a greater percentage than price increases for the sale of steel products 
we have no open derivative commodity instruments as of june  and do not currently hedge our exposure to price fluctuations in the raw materials and energy required for the manufacture of our products 
inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
we generally manufacture our products to match orders from our customers 
due to the specialized nature of our products  we are able to purchase raw materials based upon customer orders 
this operating model allows us to effectively pass along fluctuations in the price of raw materials to our customers 
for commonly used raw materials  we purchase larger quantities when we believe prices are likely to increase in the short term in order to minimize the impact of any such price increase 
although we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to effectively pass along fluctuations to our customers and our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues
