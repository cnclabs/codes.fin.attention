item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and other financial data included elsewhere herein 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
executive summary we are in the business of owning and operating thirteen timeshare resorts as of december  our income is derived principally from marketing and selling timeshare interests at our resorts in one week intervals and from the interest earned from financed sales of such timeshare interests 
as of december   we own a seven getaway resorts located within to hours of major metropolitan areas  which are the primary market for timeshare sales to new purchasers  and b six destination resorts located farther from major metropolitan areas 
the principal purchasers of timeshare interests at the destination resorts are existing owners who are upgrading or buying additional interests 
the company anticipates a continuation of the challenging economic environment which it experienced in our biggest challenges include the current economic weaknesses  constrained consumer spending  collection of customer receivables  our ability to access the capital markets  and our ability to manage inventory levels 
although we do not anticipate a significant decline in our vacation interval sales in  our success in collecting payments due on customers loans in this challenging environment will continue to pressure our bottom line 
however  we believe that conservative business decisions and aggressive cash flow management in  along with other measures in the coming year  will allow us to maintain adequate liquidity into  including the payment of our million senior subordinated notes  due april  these other measures include continuing to focus on improving the credit quality of our notes receivable  a continued favorable sales mix trend toward upgrades and second week sales to existing customers as such sales have relatively lower associated sales and marketing costs  reductions in capital expenditures for expansion at existing resorts  including construction of lodging units and additional amenities  and the prudent management of our liquidity through controlled and measured growth 
however  there can be no assurance that economic conditions will not deteriorate further  which could increase customer loan delinquencies and defaults 
increases in loan delinquencies and defaults could impair our ability to pledge or sell such loans to lenders in order to obtain sufficient cash advances to meet our obligations through  including payment of the aforementioned senior subordinated notes 

table of contents the following economic or industry wide factors are relevant to us we predominantly sell vacation and recreational products to customers who drive to our locations 
we believe that this type of usage is somewhat immune from issues that would affect the travel industry as a whole ie  the disruptions to the airline industry and destination resort industry after september  and the current state of the economy 
however  major increases in gasoline prices or other issues that cause the u 
s population to drive less could have a negative impact on us 
telemarketing is a very important element in the generation of tours to potential new customers of timeshare interests 
we presently comply with state and national do not call regulations 
changes to existing regulations could have a negative impact on our ability to generate the necessary tours to sell timeshare interests 
we will continue to assess the do not call rules impact on both operations and alternative methods of marketing  such as direct mail  that are not impacted by the new rules 
we finance the majority of our sales over seven to ten years 
a sustained economic downturn could negatively affect the ability of our customers to pay the principal and interest due on their loans  which would result in additional estimated uncollectible revenue 
our fixed to floating debt ratio is fixed and floating 
however  the majority of our floating rate debt is subject to interest rate floors between and 
although interest rates declined throughout  an increase in interest rates above applicable floor rates on our variable rate facilities could have a negative impact on our profitability 
since we predominantly finance our sales of timeshare interests  we require credit facilities to provide the liquidity necessary to fund our day to day costs and expenses 
we presently have adequate credit facilities to fund our operations into a disruption in the availability of credit facilities would severely impact our ability to continue marketing and selling timeshare interests as we do today 
we believe there are three areas which are particularly important to our success as a business identifying potential customers who are likely to pay their principal and interest payments when due after purchasing timeshare intervals  thereby resulting in an acceptable level of estimated uncollectible revenue 
maintaining sales and marketing expenses at an acceptable level to result in a favorable percentage relationship between sales and marketing expense and vacation interval sales 
maintaining adequate credit facilities to finance our operations and support the borrowings that are required for our liquidity and continued growth 
we earn revenue and income and finance our operations as follows our primary source of revenue is vacation interval sales 
vacation interval sales are a combination of sales to new customers and upgrade and or additional week sales to existing customers 
we have been focusing on increasing the percentage mix of sales to existing customers in recent years 
in addition  we have been focusing on identifying potential new customers who have more favorable credit characteristics and will ultimately be more likely to pay principal and interest on their timeshare notes when due 
to manage sales  we separately assess sales to potential new customers and sales to existing customers as different factors affect these types of sales 
for example  for sales to potential new customers  we measure sales per tour in order to ascertain that our marketing programs are delivering the proper types of family tours to effectively and efficiently generate sales and we closely monitor rescission rates 

table of contents one product that is sold to new customers is a sampler  which gives the customer the right to use the resorts on an as available basis from sunday to thursday 
revenues related to sampler contracts  which entitle the prospective owner to sample a resort during certain periods  have been and will continue to be deferred until the customer uses the stay or allows the contract to expire 
sampler sales and related costs are accounted for as incidental operations  whereby incremental costs in excess of related incremental revenues are charged to expense as incurred 
conversely  incremental revenues in excess of related incremental costs are recorded as a reduction of inventory in the consolidated balance sheet 
incremental costs include costs that would not have been incurred had we not sold samplers 
since our sampler sales primarily function as a marketing program  providing us additional opportunities to sell vacation intervals to prospective customers  the incremental costs of our sampler sales typically exceed incremental sampler revenues 
accordingly  during the years ended december    and  all sampler sales were recorded as a reduction to sales and marketing expense in the amounts of million  million  and million  respectively 
the following table shows the elements management considers important to assessing our vacation interval sales in thousands  except for tours and sales per tour year ended december  tours to potential new purchasers sales per tour gross sales to new customers rescissions of sales to new customers net sales to new customers gross sales to existing customers rescissions of sales to existing customers net sales to existing customers total sales less sampler sales total vacation interval sales rescission rate for new customers rescission rate for existing customers rescission rate for all customers in assessing the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs  we believe it is also important to compare sales and marketing expenses to vacation interval sales 
the separate elements of sales and marketing expense that we assess are the cost of marketing to new purchasers  the cost of marketing to existing purchasers  offsite marketing  commissions  and sales and marketing overhead as detailed in the following table in thousands  except for tours and cost per tour year ended december  tours to potential new purchasers cost per tour cost of marketing to new purchasers cost of marketing to existing purchasers offsite marketing commissions sales and marketing overhead sampler sales offset total sales and marketing expense as a percentage of vacation interval sales cost of marketing to new purchasers cost of marketing to existing purchasers offsite marketing commissions sales and marketing overhead sampler sales offset total sales and marketing expense our second most important source of revenue is interest income  which is predominantly earned on our notes receivable 
interest income as a percentage of average annual notes receivable has increased each year from through as a result of periodically increasing the interest rate we charged our new customers 

table of contents we have two lesser revenue sources  management fees  predominantly from silverleaf club  and other income 
we generate cash from the collection of down payments  from the collection of principal and interest from timeshare notes receivable  from sales of notes receivable  and from management fees and other income 
we also generated cash during and from the sale of undeveloped land at locations that had been previously acquired for the possible development of new resorts 
since the majority of our sales are financed  we have revolving credit facilities that are drawn upon monthly to fund our day to day costs  expenses  and capital expenditures 
we operate principally in only one business segment  the timeshare industry 
further  we only operate in the united states 
as of december   we operate resorts in six states texas  missouri  illinois  massachusetts  georgia  and florida  and sell primarily to residents of those states  with limited sales to residents of nearby states 
in addition  we own and operate a hotel located near the winter park recreational area in colorado  which provides our owners with another destination vacation alternative and gives silverleaf an entry point into this increasingly popular destination area 
our principal short term focus is on continuing to conservatively increase annual revenues 
we will continue to identify new and existing customers with acceptable credit characteristics that will allow us to profitably sell new  upgrade  and additional vacation intervals at our existing resorts 
long term  if the opportunities present themselves  we will consider adding and developing new resorts where timeshare intervals can be marketed and sold at a profit 
critical accounting policies timeshare accounting practices we follow industry specific guidance established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for real estate time sharing transactions sfas no 

in general  sfas no 
provides guidance on determining revenue recognition for timeshare transactions  evaluation of uncollectibility of vacation interval receivables  accounting for costs of vacation interval sales  accounting for operations during holding periods or incidental operations  and other accounting transactions specific to timeshare operations 
revenue and expense recognition including cost of sales a substantial portion of vacation interval sales are consummated in exchange for installment notes receivable secured by deeds of trust on each vacation interval sold 
if development costs related to a particular project or phase are complete  we recognize related vacation interval sales under the full accrual method after a binding sales contract has been executed  the buyer has made a down payment of at least  and the statutory rescission period has expired 
if all such criteria are met yet significant development costs remain to complete the project or phase  revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
under this method  once the sales criteria are met  revenues are recognized proportionate to costs already incurred relative to total costs expected for the project or phase 
there were no sales deferred at december  related to the percentage of completion method 
both of these revenue recognition methods employ the relative sales value method in determining related costs of sales and inventory applicable to each vacation interval sale recognized 
under the relative sales value method  a cost of sales percentage is used to apply costs to related sales as follows total revenues to be recognized over an entire project or phase  considering both revenues recognized to date plus estimated revenues to be recognized over future periods considering an estimate of uncollectibility and subsequent resale of recovered vacation intervals  are determined 
total costs of a project or phase  considering both costs already incurred plus estimated costs to complete the phase  if any  are determined 
common costs  including amenities  are included in total estimated costs and allocated to inventory phases that such costs are expected to benefit 
the cost of sales ratio applied to each sale represents total estimated costs as a percentage of total estimated revenues  which is specific to each inventory phase 
generally  each building type is considered a separate phase 
the estimate of total revenue for a particular phase also considers factors such as trends in uncollectibles  changes in sales mix and unit sales prices  repossessions of vacation intervals  effects of upgrade programs  and past and expected sales programs to sell slow moving inventory units 
at least quarterly  we evaluate the estimated cost of sales percentage applied to each sale using updated information for total estimated phase revenue and total estimated phase costs 
the effects of changes in estimates are accounted for in the period in which such changes first become known on a retrospective basis  such that the balance sheet at the end of the period of change and the accounting in subsequent periods reflect the revised estimates as if such estimates had been the original estimates 

table of contents as mentioned  certain vacation interval sales transactions are deferred until the minimum down payment has been received 
we account for these transactions utilizing the deposit method 
under this method  the sale is not recognized  a receivable is not recorded  and inventory is not relieved 
any cash received is carried as a deposit until the sale can be recognized 
when these types of sales are cancelled without a refund  deposits forfeited are recognized as other income and the interest portion is recognized as interest income 
this income is not significant 
we also sell additional and upgraded vacation intervals to existing owners 
revenues are recognized on an additional vacation interval sale  which represents a new vacation interval sale treated as a separate transaction from the original vacation interval sale  when the buyer makes a down payment of at least  excluding any equity from the original vacation interval purchased 
revenues are recognized on an upgrade vacation interval sale  which is a modification and continuation of the original sale  by including the buyer s equity from the original vacation interval towards the down payment of at least 
revenue recognized on upgrade vacation interval sales represents the difference between the upgrade sales price and traded in sales price  while related cost of sales represents the incremental increase in the cost of the vacation interval purchased 
we recognize interest income as earned 
interest income is accrued on notes receivable  net of an estimated amount that will not be collected  until the individual notes become days delinquent 
once a note becomes days delinquent  the accrual of interest income ceases until collection is deemed probable 
we receive fees for management services provided to silverleaf club and orlando breeze resort club 
these revenues are recognized on an accrual basis in the period the services are provided if collection is deemed probable 
services and other income are recognized on an accrual basis in the period such services are provided 
sales and marketing costs are charged to expense in the period incurred 
commissions  however  are recognized in the same period the related revenues are recognized 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid investments with an original maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less 
cash and cash equivalents include cash  certificates of deposit  and money market funds 
restricted cash restricted cash consists of certificates of deposit  collateral for construction bonds  surety bonds  and cash reserved for payments of debt 
allowance for uncollectible notes estimated uncollectible revenue is recorded at an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance for uncollectible notes at a level management considers adequate to provide for anticipated losses resulting from customers failure to fulfill their obligations under the terms of their notes 
the allowance for uncollectible notes is adjusted based upon a periodic static pool analysis of the notes receivable portfolio  which tracks uncollectible notes for each year s sales over the lives of the notes 
other factors considered in the assessment of uncollectibility include the aging of notes receivable  historical collection experience and credit losses  customer credit scores fico scores  and current economic factors 
credit losses represent three varieties as follows a full cancellation of the note  whereby the customer is relieved of the obligation and we recover the underlying inventory  a deemed cancellation  whereby we record the cancellation of all notes that become days delinquent  net of notes that are no longer days delinquent  and a note receivable reduction that occurs when a customer trades a higher value product for a lower value product 
the allowance for uncollectible notes is reduced by actual cancellations and losses experienced  including losses related to previously sold notes receivable which became delinquent and were reacquired pursuant to certain recourse obligations 
recourse on sales of customer notes receivable is governed by agreements between the purchasers of said notes and the company  though we typically do not have an obligation to repurchase defaulted notes held by our financing subsidiaries 
our estimated uncollectible revenue as a percentage of vacation interval sales was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
under the relative sales value method  an estimate of the value of inventory recoveries is considered in determining inventory costing and allocation to sales 
due to the state of the economy in general  and recent deterioration of the residential real estate market and sub prime mortgage markets  the risk of vacation interval defaults has heightened 
we will continue our current collection programs and seek new programs to reduce note defaults 
we will also maintain our focus on tour lead procurement in an effort to improve the credit quality of our customers 
during and  approximately and  respectively  of our sales were made to customers with fico scores below however  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value less cost to sell 
cost includes amounts for land  construction materials  amenities and common costs  direct labor and overhead  taxes  and capitalized interest incurred in the construction or through the acquisition of resort dwellings held for timeshare sale 
at december   the estimated costs not yet incurred but expected to complete promised amenities was  inventory costs are allocated to cost of vacation interval sales using the relative sales value method  as described above 
we periodically review the carrying value of our inventory on an individual project basis for impairment to ensure that the carrying value does not exceed market value 
vacation intervals may be reacquired as a result of i foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure or ii trade in associated with the purchase of an upgraded or downgraded vacation interval 
vacation intervals reacquired are recorded in inventory at the lower of their original cost or market value 
liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended december    and  we have been in full compliance with our debt covenants in our credit facilities with all of our senior lenders 
at december   our senior credit facilities provided for loans of up to million  of which million was available for future advances 
the following table summarizes our credit agreements with our senior lenders  our wholly owned and consolidated special purpose finance subsidiaries  our senior subordinated debt and other debt  and our credit agreement with our off balance sheet qualified spe  sf iii  as of december  in thousands maximumamount available balance receivables based revolvers receivables based non revolvers inventory loans subtotal senior credit facilities senior subordinated debt other debt subtotal on balance sheet off balance sheet receivables based term loan grand total we use these credit agreements to finance the sale of vacation intervals  to finance construction  and for working capital needs 
the loans mature between june and march and are collateralized or cross collateralized by customer notes receivable  inventory  construction in process  land  improvements  and related equipment at certain of the existing resorts 
our fixed to floating debt ratio at december  was fixed to floating 
however  the majority of our floating rate debt is subject to interest rate floors between and 
the credit facilities that bear interest at variable rates are tied to the prime rate or libor 
at december   the libor rate on our senior credit facilities was month and the prime rate on these facilities was 
the credit facilities secured by customer notes receivable allow advances of to of eligible customer notes receivable 
in addition  we have million of senior subordinated notes due april  with interest payable semi annually on april and october  guaranteed by all of our present and future domestic restricted subsidiaries 
we are aware that our outstanding debt securities are currently trading at substantial discounts to face amount 
during the fourth quarter of  we retired million of our senior subordinated notes  due april  for million  which resulted in a gain of approximately  in order to reduce future cash interest payments  as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption  we may from time to time in future periods seek to retire or purchase our outstanding senior subordinated notes through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of december  in thousands thereafter long term debt capital leases operating leases construction commitments total principal maturities on our term securitizations sf ii  sf v  and sf vi are shown proportionate to the projected collections of the corresponding notes receivable that serve as collateral to this debt 
long term debt includes million of future interest  using an approximate interest rate of  which is our weighted average cost of borrowings at december  capital leases include  of future interest  using an approximate interest rate of  which is our weighted average cost of borrowings on our capital lease obligations at december  construction commitments of million relate to the continued development of our resorts and will be funded via availability under our credit facilities 
as of december   we had availability under our credit facilities of million 
we also have a million demand note with sf ii  our wholly owned on balance sheet conduit financing subsidiary  which is excluded from long term debt as the note represents only a potential  future cash outlay and is eliminated on a consolidated basis 
net cash used in operating activities 
we generate cash primarily from the cash received on the sale of vacation intervals  the financing and collection of customer notes receivable from vacation interval owners  the sale of notes receivable to our special purpose entities  management fees  sampler sales  marina income  golf course and pro shop income  and hotel income 
we typically receive a to down payment on sales of vacation intervals and finance the remainder with the issuance of a seven to ten year customer promissory note 
we generate cash from customer notes receivable i by borrowing at an advance rate of to of eligible customer notes receivable  ii by selling notes receivable  and iii from the spread between interest received on customer notes receivable and interest paid on related borrowings 
because we use significant amounts of cash in the development and marketing of vacation intervals but collect cash on customer notes receivable over a seven to ten year period  borrowing against receivables has historically been a necessary part of normal operations 
during the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was million compared to million and million during the same periods of and  respectively 
this million decrease in cash used in operating activities during versus primarily resulted from the reduction in capital expenditures for expansion at existing resorts  including construction of lodging units and additional amenities 
this reduction in capital expenditures is consistent with our moderate growth initiative in effect for net cash used in investing activities 
during  investing activities used million of cash compared to million during and million during the million net cash used during resulted primarily from the purchase of the following assets pinnacle lodge our room hotel located near the winter park recreational area in colorado  two offsite sales offices  and a corporate aircraft 
we also began construction on the water park at the villages resort in these purchases were partially offset by net proceeds of  received from the sale of two parcels of land in mississippi 
the million net cash used during consisted of capital expenditures totaling million  partially offset by net proceeds of  received from the sale of a land parcel in texas 
the million capital expenditures resulted primarily from construction of the water park at the villages resort and purchases of unimproved real property in massachusetts and missouri 
the massachusetts land is a acre tract which adjoins acres that we own in berkshire county  massachusetts  and the missouri land consists of acres and is adjacent to our holiday hills resort in taney county  missouri 
the million cash used for investing activities in resulted primarily from the construction or expansion of member services buildings at six of our existing resorts  completion of construction on the water park at the villages resort which opened in january  and purchases of two parcels of land in texas 
we purchased approximately acres adjacent to our piney shores resort located on the shores of lake conroe  approximately miles north of houston  texas  and acres adjacent to our hill country resort  near canyon lake in the hill country of central texas between austin and san antonio 
net cash provided by financing activities 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was million compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the net cash of million provided by financing activities during was primarily the result of million of proceeds received from borrowings against pledged notes receivable and our inventory loans  partially offset by million of payments on borrowings against pledged notes receivable and our inventory loans  and million of increases in restricted cash reserved for payments of debt  all of which were primarily due to our transactions with sf iv and silverleaf finance v  lp sf v 
the net cash of million provided by financing activities during was primarily the result of million of proceeds received from borrowings against pledged notes receivable and our inventory loans  offset by million of payments on borrowings against pledged notes receivable and our inventory loans 
the net cash of million provided by financing activities during was primarily the result of million of proceeds received from borrowings against pledged notes receivable and our inventory loans  partially offset by million of payments on borrowings against pledged notes receivable and our inventory loans  and million of increases in restricted cash reserved for payments of debt 
the securitization transaction we closed in june through our newly formed  wholly owned and fully consolidated special purpose finance subsidiary  sf vi  generated million of the million of proceeds received from borrowings and million of the million of payments on borrowings for the year ended december 
table of contents at december   our senior credit facilities provided for loans of up to million  of which million of principal related to advances under the credit facilities was outstanding 
as of december   the weighted average cost of funds for all borrowings was 
customer defaults have a significant impact on our cash available from financing customer notes receivable in that notes more than days past due are not eligible as collateral 
as a result  we must repay borrowings against such delinquent notes 
as of december   million of notes  net of accounts charged off  were more than days past due 
considering forecasted sales  customer defaults  and expansion plans  our senior credit facilities provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs into to finance our growth  development  and any future expansion plans  we may at some time be required to consider the issuance of other debt  equity  or collateralized mortgage backed securities 
any debt we incur or issue may be secured or unsecured  have fixed or variable rate interest  and may be subject to such terms as we deem prudent 
certain debt agreements include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends based on minimum levels of net income and cash flow 
our ability to pay dividends might also be restricted by the texas business corporation act 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in  we consummated a securitization transaction with our wholly owned off balance sheet qualified special purpose finance subsidiary  sf iii  which was formed for the purpose of issuing million of its series a notes in a private placement 
in connection with this transaction  we sold sf iii million in timeshare receivables that were previously pledged as collateral under revolving credit facilities with our senior lenders and silverleaf finance i  inc  our former qualified spe which was dissolved in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 
 our bases for classifying sf iii as a qualified spe are i sf iii is demonstrably distinct from the transferor as dissolution of the spe would require an affirmative vote of of the spe s board of directors  one of which is independent  ii there are limits on permitted activities that the spe has the power to carry out  and iii financial assets transferred to the spe are passive in nature 
the series a notes are secured by timeshare receivables we sold to sf iii 
the timeshare receivables we sold to sf iii are without recourse to us  except for breaches of certain representations and warranties at the time of sale 
in accordance with the agreement  we continue servicing these timeshare receivables and receive fees for our services equal to of eligible timeshare receivables held by the facility 
such fees were million   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
at december   sf iii held notes receivable totaling million with related borrowings of million 
except for the repurchase of notes that fail to meet initial eligibility requirements  we are not obligated to repurchase defaulted or any other contracts sold to sf iii 
as the servicer of notes receivable sold to sf iii  we are obligated to foreclose upon vacation intervals securing defaulted note receivables 
although we are not obligated  we may purchase foreclosed vacation intervals for an amount equal to the net fair market value of such vacation intervals  which may not be less than fifteen percent of the original acquisition price that the customer paid for the vacation interval 
for the year ended december   we paid  to repurchase vacation intervals securing defaulted notes receivable to facilitate the re marketing of those vacation intervals 
the carrying value of our investment in sf iii was million at december   which represents our maximum exposure to loss regarding our investment in sf iii 
our special purpose entities provide us with additional credit availability under our facilities with our current senior lenders 
as we require credit facilities to provide liquidity necessary to fund our costs and expenses  it is vitally important to our liquidity plan to have financing available to us in order to continue to finance the majority of our timeshare sales over seven to ten years 
income taxes 
for regular federal income tax purposes  we report substantially all of the vacation interval sales we finance under the installment method 
under this method  income on sales of vacation intervals is not recognized until cash is received  either in the form of a down payment or as installment payments on customer notes receivable 
the deferral of income tax liability conserves cash resources on a current basis 
interest is imposed  however  on the amount of tax attributable to the installment payments for the period beginning on the date of sale and ending on the date the payment is received 
if we are not subject to tax in a particular year  no interest is imposed since the interest is based on the amount of tax paid in that year 
the consolidated financial statements do not contain an accrual for any interest expense that would be paid on the deferred taxes related to the installment method as the interest expense is not reasonably estimable 
as we expect to fully realize our deferred tax assets  we do not currently have a valuation reserve for deferred taxes 

table of contents as of january   we had no unrecognized tax benefits  and as a result  no benefits that would affect the effective income tax rate 
we do not anticipate any significant changes related to unrecognized tax benefits in the next months 
as of december   we did not require an accrual for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits 
in addition  we are subject to current amt as a result of the deferred income that results from the installment sales treatment 
payment of amt creates a deferred tax asset in the form of a minimum tax credit  which  unless otherwise limited  reduces the future regular tax liability attributable to vacation interval sales 
due to amt losses in certain years prior to  which offset all amt income for years prior to  no minimum tax credit exists for years prior to however  we have paid amt in subsequent years  and anticipate that we will pay amt in future periods 
federal nols of million existing at december  expire between and realization of the deferred tax assets arising from nols is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
due to a corporate restructuring  an ownership change within the meaning of section g of the internal revenue code the code occurred 
as a result  a portion of our nol is subject to an annual limitation for the current and future taxable years 
this annual limitation may be increased for any recognized built in gain to the extent allowed in section h of the code 
the current annual limitation of  represents the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
we believe that million of our net operating loss carryforwards as of december  were subject to the section limitations 
results of operations the following table summarizes key ratios from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december    and as a percentage of total revenues vacation interval sales estimated uncollectible revenue net sales interest income management fee income other income total revenues as a percentage of vacation interval sales cost of vacation interval sales sales and marketing as a percentage of total revenues operating  general and administrative depreciation as a percentage of interest income interest expense and lender fees results of operations for the years ended december  and revenues revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing a million  or  increase compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  as discussed below  the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in vacation interval sales and an million increase in interest income offset by a million increase in estimated uncollectible revenue during the year ended december  
table of contents the following table summarizes our vacation interval sales for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands  except average price average average sales intervals price sales intervals price interval sales to new customers upgrade interval sales to existing customers additional interval sales to existing customers total vacation interval sales increased in versus primarily due to a increase in tours 
the number of interval sales to new customers increased and average prices increased  which resulted in an increase in sales to new customers in versus the number of upgrade interval sales to existing customers decreased but average prices increased  resulting in a net increase in upgrade interval sales to existing customers during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the number of additional interval sales to existing customers decreased but average prices increased  resulting in a net increase in additional interval sales to existing customers during versus vacation interval sales to existing customers comprised and of total vacation interval sales in the years ended december  and  respectively  which maintains our favorable sales mix trend toward upgrades and second week sales to existing customers as such sales have relatively lower associated sales and marketing costs 
on september   hurricane ike struck the texas coast near our seaside resort in galveston  texas  causing property damage and business interruption losses at this resort and  to a lesser extent  our piney shores resort just north of houston  texas 
seaside resort was fully operational by december piney shores resort reopened september we are still assessing the full extent of business interruption losses related to this hurricane 
estimated uncollectible revenue  which represents estimated future gross cancellations of notes receivable  was million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  our estimated uncollectible revenue as a percentage of vacation interval sales was for the year compared to for our receivables charged off as a percentage of beginning of period gross notes receivable was for compared to for the same period of since the fourth quarter of  we have increased the provision for estimated uncollectible revenue each successive quarter as follows for the first quarter of  for the second quarter of  for the third quarter of  and for the fourth quarter of due to the increased defaults during  our provision for estimated uncollectible revenue has increased to maintain the allowance for uncollectible notes at a level management considers adequate to provide for anticipated losses resulting from customer defaults 
however  there can be no assurance that the percentage of estimated uncollectible revenue will remain at its current level 
we review the allowance for uncollectible notes quarterly and make adjustments as necessary 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase primarily resulted from a higher average notes receivable balance in versus the same period of  and an increase in the weighted average yield on our outstanding notes receivable to at december  from at december  management fee income  which consists of management fees collected from the resorts management clubs  cannot exceed the management clubs net income 
management fee income increased  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to increased profitability of the resorts management clubs 
other income consists of water park income  marina income  golf course and pro shop income  hotel income  and other miscellaneous items 
other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to million of insurance proceeds we received in november for business interruption losses incurred as a result of hurricane ike and million of income from our water park at the villages resort which opened in january cost of vacation interval sales under the relative sales value method  cost of sales is estimated as a percentage of net sales using a cost of sales percentage which represents the ratio of total estimated cost  including both costs already incurred plus estimated costs to complete the phase  if any  to total estimated vacation interval revenues under the project  including amounts already recognized and estimated future revenues 
common costs  including amenities  are allocated to inventory cost among the phases that those costs are expected to benefit 
the estimate of total revenue for a phase considers factors such as trends in uncollectibles  changes in sales mix and unit sales prices  repossessions of vacation intervals  effects of upgrade programs  and past and expected future sales programs to sell slow moving inventory units 
cost of vacation interval sales remained relatively flat at of vacation interval sales during compared to during 
table of contents sales and marketing sales and marketing expense as a percentage of vacation interval sales increased to for the year ended december  versus for the comparable prior year period 
the million increase in sales and marketing expense is attributable to the increased volume of vacation interval sales and the higher cost of various marketing efforts to improve the credit quality of our customers 
the sales mix remained fairly constant for the year ended december  compared to the same period of at of sales to existing customers in versus of sales to existing customers in in accordance with sfas no 
 sampler sales and related costs are accounted for as incidental operations  whereby incremental costs in excess of related incremental revenues are charged to expense as incurred

table of contents cost of vacation interval sales under the relative sales value method  cost of sales is estimated as a percentage of net sales using a cost of sales percentage which represents the ratio of total estimated cost  including both costs already incurred plus estimated costs to complete the phase  if any  to total estimated vacation interval revenues under the project  including amounts already recognized and estimated future revenues 
common costs  including amenities  are allocated to inventory cost among the phases that those costs are expected to benefit 
the estimate of total revenue for a phase considers factors such as trends in uncollectibles  changes in sales mix and unit sales prices  repossessions of vacation intervals  effects of upgrade programs  and past and expected future sales programs to sell slow moving inventory units 
cost of vacation interval sales decreased to in compared to in during  cost of sales decreased due to increases in our future relative sales value related to an increase in repossession and resale of timeshare intervals  an increase in expected future sales price on some of our higher end products  and an increase in our master plan for new units added across our properties as we continue to execute on our long term growth strategy of adding lodging units  amenities  and other assets to our existing properties

sales and marketing sales and marketing expense as a percentage of vacation interval sales increased to for the year ended december  versus for the comparable prior year period 
the million increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily attributable to our increased volume of vacation interval sales as well as increased costs related to new and existing promotional programs used to generate tours 
these promotional programs were a primary factor in providing us with a growth in tours to potential new purchasers and a increase in vacation interval sales during the year of versus in accordance with sfas no 
 sampler sales and related costs are accounted for as incidental operations  whereby incremental costs in excess of related incremental revenues are charged to expense as incurred 
since our sampler sales primarily function as a marketing program  allowing us additional opportunities to sell vacation intervals to prospective customers  the incremental costs of our sampler sales typically exceed incremental sampler revenues

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general interest on our notes receivable portfolio  senior subordinated debt  capital leases  and miscellaneous notes is fixed  whereas interest on our primary loan agreements  which had a total facility amount of million at december   have a fixed to floating debt ratio of fixed to floating 
however  the majority of our floating rate debt is subject to interest rate floors between and 
the impact of a one point effective interest rate change on the million balance of variable rate financial instruments at december  would be approximately  on our results of operations  after taxes  for the year ended december   or approximately per diluted share 
at december   the carrying value of our notes receivable portfolio approximates fair value because the weighted average interest rate on the portfolio approximates current interest rates received on similar notes 
our fixed rate notes receivable are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in fair value if market rates increase  which may negatively impact our ability to sell our fixed rate notes in the marketplace 
a hypothetical one point interest rate increase in the marketplace at december  would result in a fair value decrease of approximately million on our notes receivable portfolio 

table of contents credit risk we are exposed to on balance sheet credit risk related to our notes receivable 
we are exposed to off balance sheet credit risk related to notes sold 
we offer financing to the buyers of vacation intervals at our resorts 
these buyers generally make a down payment of to of the purchase price and deliver a promissory note to us for the balance 
the promissory notes generally bear interest at a fixed rate  are payable over a seven to ten year period  and are secured by a deed of trust on the vacation interval 
we bear the risk of defaults on these promissory notes 
although we prescreen prospects via credit scoring techniques in the early stages of the marketing and sales process  we generally do not perform a detailed credit history review of our customers 
due to the state of the economy in general  and recent deterioration of the residential real estate market and sub prime mortgage markets  the risk of vacation interval defaults has heightened 
because we use various mass marketing techniques  a certain percentage of our sales are generated from customers who may be considered to have marginal credit quality 
during and  approximately and  respectively  of our sales were made to customers with fico scores below in addition  we have experienced an increase in defaults in our loan portfolio as compared to historical rates 
due to deteriorating economic conditions  there can be no assurance that defaults have stabilized or that they will not increase further 
these and other recent adverse changes in the credit markets and related uncertain economic conditions may eliminate or reduce the availability or increase the cost of significant sources of funding for us in the future 
we increased our estimated uncollectible revenue as a percentage of vacation interval sales to for the year ended december  from for the comparable period of however  if default rates for our borrowers were to continue to rise  it may require an additional increase in our estimated uncollectible revenue 
we will continue to evaluate our collections process and marketing programs with a view toward establishing procedures aimed at reducing note defaults and improving the credit quality of our customers 
however  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
if a buyer of a vacation interval defaults  we generally must foreclose on the vacation interval and attempt to resell it  the associated marketing  selling  and administrative costs from the original sale are not recovered  and such costs must be incurred again to resell the vacation interval 
although in many cases we may have recourse against a vacation interval buyer for the unpaid note balance  certain states have laws that limit our ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans 
accordingly  we have generally not pursued this remedy 
interest rate risk we have historically derived net interest income from our financing activities because the interest rates we charge our customers who finance the purchase of their vacation intervals exceed the interest rates we pay to our senior lenders 
as of our senior indebtedness bears interest at variable rates and our customer notes receivable bear interest at fixed rates  increases in interest rates will erode the spread in interest rates that we have historically experienced and could cause our interest expense on borrowings to exceed our interest income on our portfolio of customer loans 
although interest rates declined throughout  any increase in interest rates above applicable floor rates  particularly if sustained  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
to partially offset potential increases in interest rates  we have executed two interest rate swaps related to our conduit loan with sf ii  with fixed rates of and  for a total notional amount of million at december  such interest rate swaps expire between september and march our variable funding note with sf iv also acts as an interest rate hedge since it contains a provision for an interest rate cap 
the balance outstanding under this line of credit at december  was million 
such variable funding note will mature in september in addition  the series a notes related to our off balance sheet special purpose finance subsidiary  sf iii  with a balance of million at december   bear interest at a blended fixed rate of availability of funding sources we fund substantially all of our notes receivable  timeshare inventories  and land inventories which we originate or purchase with borrowings through our financing facilities  sales of notes receivable  internally generated funds  and proceeds from public debt and equity offerings 
borrowings are in turn repaid with the proceeds we receive from collections on such notes receivable 
to the extent that we are not successful in maintaining or replacing existing financings  we would have to curtail our operations or sell assets  thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
geographic concentration our notes receivable and vacation interval inventories are primarily originated in texas  missouri  illinois  massachusetts  georgia  and florida 
risks inherent in such concentrations are regional and general economic stability  which affects property values and the financial stability of the borrowers  and the continued popularity of our resort destinations  which affects the marketability of our products and the collection of notes receivable
