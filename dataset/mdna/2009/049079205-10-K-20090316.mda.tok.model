item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide wireless and wireline telecommunications services in the caribbean and north america through the following principal operating subsidiaries guyana telephone telegraph company  ltd 
gt t  the national and international telephone company in the republic of guyana and the largest wireless service provider in that country 
the company has owned of the stock of gt t since january gt t generated approximately  and of the company s consolidated revenues in  and  respectively 
the reduction in these percentages is principally due to the acquisitions noted below and the growth in those acquired operations 
commnet wireless  llc commnet  an owner and operator of wholesale wireless networks in rural areas of the united states 
commnet provides wireless voice and data communications roaming services primarily to national  regional and local wireless carriers 
the company completed its acquisition of of commnet on september  and the remaining in january bermuda digital communications  ltd 
bdc  the largest wireless voice and data communications service provider in bermuda  doing business under the name cellular one 
the company acquired an equity interest in  and signed a management contract with  bdc in on may   bdc completed a share repurchase of its common stock 
atn did not tender any shares for repurchase  and  as a result of the transaction  increased its holdings from approximately to approximately of bdc s outstanding common stock 
prior to this increase in holdings  the company accounted for its investment in bdc under the equity method and earnings from bdc did not appear in its income from operations  but were instead reflected in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
effective with the completion of that share repurchase  the company began consolidating bdc s balance sheet and results of operations 
in september  bdc began providing wireless services in turks and caicos through islandcom telecommunications  ltd 
sovernet  inc sovernet  a facilities based integrated voice  broadband data communications and dial up service provider in new england and new york state 
sovernet s retail telecommunications service is delivered to business and residential customers in vermont and new hampshire 
the company has owned of sovernet since its acquisition in february in august  sovernet began providing wholesale transport services in new york state through its subsidiary  ion holdco llc 
choice communications  llc choice  is a leading provider of fixed wireless broadband data  and dial up internet services to retail and business customers in the us virgin islands 
choice is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
as a holding company  we provide management  technical  financial  regulatory  and marketing services to  and typically receive a management fee equal to approximately to of revenues from  each operating subsidiary 
management fees from consolidated subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation 
management fees from unconsolidated affiliates are included in other income in the accompanying statements of operations

over the last several years  we have significantly diversified our business and reduced our historical dependence on gt t s operations for our financial results 
this reduction of gt t s contribution is mainly through the acquisition and growth of commnet 
we are dependent on gt t and commnet for a substantial majority of our revenues and profits 
for the year ended december   approximately of our consolidated revenue and approximately of our consolidated operating income were generated by these two operating subsidiaries 
commnet s revenues and profits are primarily driven by the number of sites and base stations we operate  the amount voice and data traffic that each of these sites generates  and the rate we get paid from our carrier customers on that traffic 
commnet s contribution to our consolidated revenues has grown from approximately in to approximately in  and in commnet was the single largest contributor to our net income 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the largest single component of gt t s revenues and profits has been from its international long distance business  which accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue during the year ended december  while the majority of this international long distance revenue is generated by calls originated by  or terminating with  wireline and wireless customers  we are currently the exclusive provider of international voice and data and therefore generate revenue and profit from calls and data originating on our competitor s wireless network 
the primary drivers of the long distance business are the population of guyanese living abroad who initiate calls to guyana and the rate foreign carriers pay gt t for handling the incoming international calls 
however  in recent years  we believe various methods of illegal bypass and alternative and cheaper media for communication  such as e mail and text messaging  may have had a negative impact on both voice traffic and on international long distance revenues 
in  there was a substantial increase in illegal bypass activities 
we have taken a number of measures to counter illegal bypass  including taking action against unlicensed operators in guyana  introducing special outbound call center rates and we are examining automated technical solutions as well 
more recently  we also 
table of contents believe the current economic recession has impacted the volume of inbound calls into guyana and negatively impacted our revenues 
gt t also faces significant competition for wireless services in guyana 
since early  digicel  a large regional wireless operator  has used aggressive operational and capital spending to gain market share  including promotional pricing  the use of extensive give a ways and handset subsidies 
in  our wireless subscribers decrease by which we believe is attributable to this increased competition 
although we believe that we are well positioned to compete based on network coverage  quality of service and standard pricing  we believe that digicel s success at obtaining market share from us is due in large part to their level of marketing and promotional activity 
as of december   we have invested approximately million in guyanese telecommunications infrastructure 
in addition to our planned capital expenditures to improve our gt t network  we will be investing over the next months an additional million to million in a new submarine fiber optic cable in guyana 
the construction of this cable connecting guyana to trinidad will provide for continued growth in the provision of high speed data and internet services into guyana  as well as giving us a cost effective method of increased redundancy 
we believe this is particularly important in the current operating environment of a worldwide shift from voice driven applications to data driven applications and the growth in broadband demand 
as previously disclosed in our prior public reports  the government of guyana has stated its intention to introduce additional competition into guyana s telecommunications sector and has held formal discussions with us  most recently in early  regarding potential modifications of gt t s exclusivity rights 
in october  gt t was informally notified that the government had retained the services of a us based law firm and a consultant to develop the legislative and regulatory reforms necessary to introduce telecommunication competition in guyana 
based on informal discussions with these parties  we expect draft legislation to be available as early as the second half of our exclusive license has a stated expiration in december and is  accordingly to its terms  renewable for an additional year term at our option 
at this time  atn and gt t do not know whether or how any draft legislation will address gt t s exclusive license  and if so  whether it would be pursuant to an agreement between gt t and the government 
other than entering into such an agreement on terms acceptable to us  we would seek to enforce gt t s rights by law and contract to be the exclusive provider of international voice and data services in guyana 
although we believe that we would be entitled to damages for any involuntary termination of that license  we cannot guarantee that we would prevail in any court or arbitration proceeding 
see business regulation regulation of our gt t subsidiary regulatory developments and risk factors our exclusive license to provide local exchange and international voice and data services in guyana is subject to significant political and regulatory risk 
other significant steps in this diversification include the expansion of our sovernet business and the recent increase in our ownership interest in bdc and related acquisitions  as described under the captions business local telephone and data services us operations and wireless services bermuda operations 
we expect to continue this trend of diversification and are actively evaluating additional investment and acquisition opportunities that meet our return on investment and other acquisition criteria

wireless revenue includes wholesale voice and data roaming revenue from our rural us operations and retail wireless revenues generated in guyana 
for  wireless revenue also includes retail wireless revenues generated by our island wireless segment 
wireless revenue increased to million for from million for  an increase of million  or 
notwithstanding the sale of base stations during the fourth quarter of  our rural us business increased its revenues by million  or  to million for from million 
the increase in revenue from our us wireless business was due primarily to growth in 
table of contents voice and data traffic at existing sites  as well as the continued deployment of additional gsm and cdma wireless base stations that generated additional minutes of use and increased data revenue 
also included in this increase was million of switching fees earned on the sold base stations 
as of december   a total of base stations were deployed as compared to base stations as of december  we put into service new base stations  acquired base stations  and decommissioned older tdma analog base stations 
verizon wireless s january acquisition of alltel will cause some loss of revenue for us because the network assets they acquired overlap our network in certain areas  but we expect that overall revenue from verizon wireless will grow in due to our ongoing network expansion 
however  in connection with the alltel acquisition  verizon wireless will be required to divest itself of certain assets that overlap some areas of commnet s network 
if the buyer or buyers of those assets includes one of our other major customers  it may have a significant negative impact on our revenues 
the consolidation of our bdc operating results  which began as of may   contributed million of the increase in wireless revenue 
this increase in wireless revenue from our rural us operations and bdc was partially offset by a decline in wireless revenue in guyana 
as discussed previously  a large regional wireless operator entered the guyana market in early with aggressive marketing campaigns and handset subsidies 
this decline in revenue in reflects the continued impact of that competition  a decrease in rates and the introduction of per second billing in march for all wireless calls 
this additional competition in guyana caused our wireless subscribers to decrease by  or  from  subscribers as of december  to  subscribers as of december   respectively 
we also believe there may have been a decline in the total wireless subscribers in the market as the level of handset subsidies and giveaways fell from these factors resulted in a million decrease in gt t s wireless revenue from million during to million during while we do not expect wireless subscribers or revenue in guyana to continue to decline at this rate  our competitor could continue to take market share with aggressive spending and an overall decline in the guyana market for wireless subscribers and spending could decline due to worsening economic conditions or other factors 
local telephone and data revenue 
local telephone and data revenue is generated by our wireline operations in guyana  our integrated voice and data operations in new england and new york state  and our data services in the us virgin islands 
this revenue includes basic service fees  measured service revenue  and internet access fees  as well as installation charges for new lines  monthly line rental charges  long distance or toll charges excluding international long distance charges in guyana  maintenance and equipment sales 
local telephone and data revenue increased by million  or  to million for from million for the increase is primarily attributable to growth in gt t s access lines in guyana from approximately  lines as of december  to approximately  lines as of december  an increase of  increased interconnect fees  growth in broadband data customers in guyana and continued strong growth in wireless broadband customers in the us virgin islands 
sovernet increased revenues by million  due mainly to the addition of ion on august  sovernet continues to add business customers for its voice and data services at a strong rate and improve profitability  however  its overall revenue increase is partially offset by the decline in its residential data business  particularly its dial up internet services 
international long distance revenue 
international long distance revenue is generated by international telephone calls into and out of guyana and does not include international long distance revenue generated by our other operations 
inbound traffic  which made up of all international long distance traffic and more than of international long distance revenue for the year ended december   is settled in us dollars 

table of contents international long distance revenue declined by million  or  from million for to million for this decline was partly a result of certain significant events during  such as the run up to guyana s hosting of cricket world cup matches and the rio group summit  which we believe increased traffic volumes during that period 
we are also subject to illegal bypass via internet calling  which we believe increased considerably from the second to the fourth quarter of international voice traffic may also decline as a result of the growth of alternative and cheaper media for communications  such as e mail and text messaging 
these other modes of communication may cause a decline in both voice traffic and in international long distance revenues in future periods  although we may see a slight increase in traffic and revenues if we are effective in combating illegal bypass 
the outcome of negotiations with the government of guyana regarding the exclusivity terms of gt t s license is also likely to negatively impact this revenue in the future 
other revenue 
other revenue represents revenue from wireless digital television services in the us virgin islands  which decreased to million for from million for we expect to discontinue this service in termination and access fee expenses 
termination and access fee expenses are charges that we pay for voice and data transport circuits in particular  the circuits between our rural wireless sites and our switches  internet capacity and other access fees we pay to terminate our calls 
termination and access fees increased by million  or  from million to million from to  respectively as a result of increased traffic at commnet  the consolidation of bdc s results of operations and an increase in expenses at sovernet due to the operating results of its august acquisition of ion 
internet and programming expenses 
internet and programming expenses include internet connectivity charges and digital television programming 
internet and programming expenses remained at million in and this is consistent with the minimal growth in our broadband data and television subscribers in the us virgin islands 
engineering and operations expenses 
engineering and operations expenses include the expenses associated with developing  operating  supporting and expanding our networks  including the salaries and benefits paid for employees directly involved in the development and operation of our networks

throughout  gt t incurred an unusually high level of sales and marketing costs as a response to increased wireless competition  including wireless handset promotions  increased advertising and higher sales commissions 
in  gt t s sales and marketing expenses returned to a lower level 
the decrease in gt t s sales and marketing expenses was partially offset by bdc s sales and marketing expenses which we began to consolidate effective may  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include salaries  benefits and related costs for general corporate functions  including executive management  finance and administration  legal and regulatory  facilities  information technology and human resources 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million to million for and  respectively

depreciation and amortization expenses represent the depreciation and amortization charges we record on our property and equipment and on our intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  from million to million for and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the addition of fixed assets from our network expansion in our rural us wireless business and guyana  the consolidation of bdc s results  and the acquisitions of ion and islandcom 
impairment of long lived assets 
in the fourth quarter of  choice communications recorded a million asset impairment charge related to the wireless digital television portion of the business 
in late  choice was denied certain tax benefits by the us virgin islands government 
this denial of tax benefits  together with minimal anticipated future television subscriber and market share growth within its existing geographic footprint  resulted in the estimated future cash flows associated with this business being below the carrying value of the assets 
we now expect to discontinue television services in the company  through a separate impairment test  determined that no impairment existed as of december  relating to choice s internet services  including both the broadband data and dial up products 
gain on disposition of long lived assets 
in december  commnet sold to a national carrier base stations  along with spectrum licenses  in two midwestern states and recorded a gain on the sale of million 
also  during the first half of  commnet sold telecom assets  predominantly in western states  and recognized a gain on the sale of such assets of million 
these gains were offset by a loss of million as a result of the company s sale of all of its assets in haiti in august interest expense

on september   the company repaid the then outstanding million term loan with the proceeds from a new million term loan 
at the same time  the company s revolving line of credit facility expanded from million to million 
further description of the new credit facility is set forth in note  long term debt to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
also during september  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement which is further detailed in note  derivative instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
interest expense increased million from million to million for the years ended and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense was due to the increase in our term loan borrowings 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit during or interest income 
interest income represents interest earned on our cash  cash equivalent and short term investments 
interest income decreased million from million for to million in the decrease was a result of a decrease in the rate of interest earned on cash and investments in other income expense 
other income expense represents miscellaneous non operational income we earned or expenses we incurred 
included in other income for were management fees received from bdc which  since may  have been eliminated in consolidation 
other income decreased from million in to million in as a result of a million license settlement at commnet during  as well as the elimination  in consolidation  of management fees from bdc following their consolidation in may 
table of contents income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for and for income tax expense includes tax at the statutory us federal and state income tax rates as well as the guyanese income taxes in excess of the statutory us income tax rates 
the effective tax rate is impacted by the receipt of foreign dividends and by the amortization of a deferred tax asset  relating to differences between book and tax basis of fixed assets  which was recorded in a prior period minority interests 
minority interests consists of the guyana government s interest in gt t  a minority shareholder s interest in sovernet  minority shareholders equity interest in bdc  subsequent to our consolidation of bdc in may  and other minority shareholders interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries of commnet and sovernet

table of contents wireless revenue also increased as a result of growth in voice and data traffic minutes and megabytes at existing sites  growth in data roaming revenue and growth in international roaming revenue 
the remaining increase in wireless revenue was attributable to the continued growth of our wireless subscriber base in guyana and certain non recurring events such as guyana s hosting of cricket world cup matches and the rio group summit 
our wireless subscribers in guyana increased by  or  from  subscribers to  subscribers as of december  and  respectively 
such increase in subscribers was aided by the company s increased sales and marketing efforts  including handset promotions 
gt t s wireless revenue was million and million for and  respectively 
while we experienced growth in wireless revenue  subscribers and wireless minutes in guyana  we have also experienced a significant decline in average revenue per user arpu 
we attribute the reduction in arpu to i a reduction in retail rates  ii increased penetration into a lower usage demographic and iii pre paid customers holding handsets subscribed both to our and our competitor s network 
all of gt t s  wireless subscribers were gsm gprs subscribers as of december  as compared to  as of december  however  gains by our competitor and  we believe  a slowdown in overall wireless penetration  led to a decline in our wireless subscribers and revenue between the third and fourth quarter of our wireless competitor in guyana invested significant sums in expanding the service offerings and network capability of its network 
this competitor also launched many promotional pricing plans and extensive handset subsidies 
local telephone and data revenue 
local telephone and data revenue increased by million  or  to million for from million for of the million increase  million derives from the inclusion of a full year of results for sovernet  our vermont based voice and data provider which was acquired in february while sovernet continued to add business customers for its voice and data services  it was negatively impacted by the decline in its residential data business  particularly its dial up internet services 
the remaining increase of million primarily is attributable to growth in gt t s access lines in guyana from approximately  lines as of december  to approximately  lines as of december  an increase of  growth in broadband data customers in guyana  and growth in wireless broadband and dedicated access customers in the us virgin islands 
international long distance revenue 
international long distance revenue increased by million  or  from million for to million for this increase was primarily driven by continued expansion of our wireline network and increased traffic as well as a substantial growth in wireless subscribers within guyana for both gt t and its competitor  which uses gt t s international network and the impact of certain non recurring events such as guyana s hosting of cricket world cup matches and the rio group summit 
we were also subject to illegal bypass via internet calling and compete against alternative and cheaper media for communication  such as e mail and text messaging 
other revenue 
other revenue represents revenue from wireless digital television services in the us virgin islands  which increased to million for from million for the increase in television services was a result of higher prices for our services and a increase in television subscribers including additional hotel rooms 
termination and access fee expenses 
termination and access fees increased by million  or  from million to million from to  respectively 
this increase was due to a full year of operations of sovernet and increased traffic growth at gt t and commnet 
in addition  an outage of the americas ii submarine fiber optic cable in may  which guyana and its neighboring countries rely on as their primary international telecommunications connection  caused gt t to temporarily re route international traffic over more costly high capacity satellite links and then to increase its standby satellite capacity 

table of contents internet and programming expenses 
internet and programming expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily from reduced expenses in the us virgin islands offset by growth in our television and broadband data subscribers 
beginning in december  we were able to significantly reduce the internet capacity expenses for our us virgin island operations 
engineering and operations expenses 
engineering and operations expenses increased by million  or  from million to million for to  respectively 
this increase is primarily the result of the expansion of our wireless networks in the united states and guyana 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million  or  from million to million from to  respectively 
substantially all of the increase is attributable to higher sales and marketing expenditures at gt t in order to address intensified wireless competition in guyana 
such sales and marketing expenditures include the costs of wireless handset promotions  increased advertising and higher sales commissions

interest expense represents interest incurred on our outstanding debt including our million term loan as well as the outstanding amounts under our million revolving line of credit facility 
interest expense decreased from million for to million for this decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in the average outstanding balance under our loan facility during as compared to when we used borrowings from the revolving line of credit to help fund certain acquisitions 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the underwritten public offering of our common stock in july to repay those borrowings and had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit during the decrease in interest expense was also due to a lower effective interest rate during interest income 
interest income represents interest earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances

income taxes 
our effective tax rate was and for and  respectively  which represents the statutory us income tax rate plus the guyanese income taxes in excess of the statutory us income tax rates as well as certain us state income taxes 
the effective tax rate is also impacted by the amortization of a deferred tax asset  relating to differences between the book and tax basis of fixed assets  which was recorded in a prior year 
our higher effective tax rate for the period reflects the fact that our losses in the us virgin islands were not available to reduce taxable income in guyana  which has a high tax rate of 
the reduction in our effective rate in is also a result of the impact of additional taxable income at us statutory rates and the ability to use certain tax credits during the fourth quarter of minority interests 
for  minority interests consisted of the guyana government s interest in gt t  a minority shareholder s interest in sovernet and other minority shareholders interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries of commnet

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates includes our share of the earnings of bdc as well as our share of the earnings of commnet s unconsolidated affiliates 
the decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates from million to million for and  respectively  was due to a decrease in the net earnings of bdc as a result of bdc s loss of market share

liquidity and capital resources we have met  and anticipate that we will meet in the future  our operational liquidity needs through a combination of cash on hand and internally generated funds and have funded capital expenditures and acquisitions with a combination of internally generated funds  cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities 
uses of cash capital expenditures 
a significant use of our cash has been for capital expenditures for expanding and upgrading our networks 
for the years ended december  and  we spent approximately million and million on capital expenditures  respectively 
of the million of capital expenditures  we spent approximately million  including million in connection 
table of contents with commnet s december acquisition of cc communications in nevada  expanding commnet s network by increasing the number of gsm and cdma base stations as well as switching and cell site equipment required to expand our geographic coverage and technical capabilities 
in addition  approximately million was incurred expanding the capacity and coverage of guyana s wireline and wireless network and early stage construction costs on a new fiber optic submarine cable into the country 
we also spent million at sovernet and expanded our service areas and switch capabilities 
we are continuing to invest in expanding the networks of gt t  commnet  sovernet and bdc and expect to incur capital expenditures between million and million  with over one half used in connection with commnet s network expansion during the year ended december  in addition we expect to incur an additional million to million of capital expenditures in on the construction of the submarine fiber optic cable in guyana 
we expect to fund these expenditures primarily from cash generated from our operations 
acquisitions and investments 
we have funded our recent acquisitions with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities 
during january  we purchased the remaining equity interest in commnet for million and  shares of our common stock in satisfaction of our obligation and in accordance with our right under and consistent with the terms of the agreement entered into in connection with our acquisition of commnet in september we funded this purchase with cash on hand and the reissuance of shares held in our treasury 
on may   our equity interest in bdc increased from to as a result of bdc s repurchase of million of shares from other shareholders 
we provided bdc with a loan to fund this transaction from cash on hand 
on august   sovernet completed its acquisition of of the equity of ion  llc  a new york state provider of high capacity communications network transport services for million in cash which was funded from cash on hand 
the acquisition of ion continues the company s strategy of providing high quality network services to underserved rural markets

we funded the transaction from cash on hand 
on september   bdc completed its acquisition of of the equity of islandcom  a provider of wireless telecommunication services in turks and caicos for million in cash 
we provided bdc an additional million loan to fund this transaction 
if current laws  which restrict foreign ownership of companies operating in turks and caicos  are changed  bdc will be able to increase its ownership in islandcom from to through the exercise of a warrant  valued at million  received as a part of the acquisition 
since officers of atn and bdc make up a majority of islandcom s board of directors  the company is consolidating the operating results of islandcom since the date of acquisition 
we continue to explore opportunities to acquire communications properties or licenses in the caribbean  the united states and elsewhere 
we also explore opportunities to substantially expand our existing networks in the united states and the caribbean including the plan to land a submarine cable to guyana as mentioned earlier 
such acquisitions may require external financing 
while there can be no assurance as to whether  when or on what terms we will be able to acquire any such businesses or licenses  such acquisitions may be accomplished through the issuance of shares  payment of cash or incurrence of additional debt

cash generated by operations 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to a decrease in accrued taxes 
cash generated by financing activities credit facility and interest rate swap 
on september   we  as borrower entered into a credit agreement with cobank  acb and other lenders as referenced within the credit agreement the cobank credit agreement 
the cobank credit agreement replaced the previous credit facility and provides a million term loan the term loan as well as a million revolving credit facility the revolver facility  together with the term loan  the credit facility 
the term loan matures on september  and requires quarterly repayments of principal of million through june  and quarterly repayments of principal of million from september  to june  the remaining outstanding principal balance of million is to be repaid on september  when the term loan matures 
the revolver facility matures on september  and includes a million letter of credit facility 
all borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate  selected by us from one of the options as defined with the agreement  plus a margin

margins for base rate borrowings range from to  depending upon our leverage ratio  while margins for libor borrowings range from to  also depending upon our leverage ratio

the credit agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants of the company and its subsidiaries as set forth below under factors affecting sources of liquidity 
the credit facility is guaranteed by the company s 
table of contents commnet and sovernet subsidiaries and is collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of and stock owned by the company and such guarantors 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all of the covenants of the cobank credit agreement 
on september  the company executed a forward starting interest rate swap 
the company s objective in using the derivative is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates 
the interest rate swap has an initial notional amount of million  receives month libor  and pays a fixed rate of 
the interest rate swap agreement effectively converts the variable interest payments on the first million of the term loan to a fixed rate of plus the applicable credit spread  over the life of the agreement 
the interest rate swap agreement has an effective date of october   and a maturity date of september  factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
the key factors affecting our internally generated funds are demand for our services  competition  regulatory developments  economic conditions in the markets where we operate our businesses and industry trends within the telecommunications industry

guyana us foreign currency exchange 
gt t s functional currency is the us dollar because a majority of gt t s revenues and expenditures have historically been transacted in us dollars 
since through december  the value of the guyana dollar has remained at guyana dollars to one us dollar so we have not experienced any foreign currency gains or losses during those periods 
if this exchange rate was to fluctuate in the future  this would affect our results of operations to the extent we are required to remeasure any monetary assets or liabilities denominated in guyana dollars 
moreover  with the potential for competition in international services in the future  combined with the increases that gt t hopes to have in local revenue which is billed in guyana dollars  it is possible that the guyana dollar will become gt t s functional currency at some point in the future 
this would also expose us to foreign currency risk in the event of exchange rate fluctuations 
gt t generally endeavors to maintain a balance between its guyana dollar cash deposits and local receivables which are denominated in guyana dollars and its local tax and other payables which are also denominated in the guyana dollar 
as of december   gt t maintained us million of its cash balances in guyana dollars

restrictions under credit facility 
the credit agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants of the company and its subsidiaries 
among other things  these covenants restrict the company s ability to incur additional debt in the future or to incur liens on its property 
the credit agreement also requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios including a net leverage ratio of less than or equal to to  an interest coverage ratio of greater than or equal to to and an equity to assets ratio of greater than or equal to to as of december   the company was in compliance with all of the covenants of the cobank credit agreement and would be able to fully draw the million available under its revolving credit facility 
capital markets 
our ability to raise funds in the capital markets depends on  among other things  general economic conditions  the conditions of the telecommunications industry  our financial performance and the state of the capital markets 
in june  the securities and exchange commission declared effective a universal shelf registration statement filed by the company 
this shelf registration statement registered the potential future offerings by us  from time to time  of up to an aggregate of million of our securities  consisting potentially of common stock  debt securities  
table of contents and other equity and convertible securities and combinations of the foregoing 
we have approximately million of securities registered for potential future offerings pursuant to the shelf registration statement  which we may offer and sell until june inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated operations in any of the periods presented in the report 
critical accounting estimates we have based our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap 
we base our estimates on our operating experience and on various conditions existing in the market and we believe them to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the assumptions or estimates we have selected have the potential of materially impacting our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize for a particular transaction  we apply the criteria established by staff accounting bulletin or sab no 
revenue recognition and defer those items that do not meet the recognition criteria 
as a result of the cutoff times of our billing cycles  we are often required to estimate the amount of revenues earned but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period 
these estimates are based primarily on rate plans in effect and historical evidence with each customer or carrier 
adjustments affecting revenue can and occasionally do occur in periods subsequent to the period when the services were provided  billed and recorded as revenue  however historically these adjustments have not been material 
a small portion of our revenue is attributable to activation or reactivation fees  installation fees and equipment sales 
we evaluate these transactions in accordance with the guidance prescribed in emerging issues task force issue no 
accounting for revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables and  where the amounts charged for such services or the equipment does not represent a separate unit of accounting  these amounts are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated customer relationship period 
we apply judgment when assessing the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of customers 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable losses 
our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers collection experience  aging of the accounts receivable  the credit quality of customer and  where necessary  other macro economic factors 
long lived and intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying amount 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management s assumptions and projections 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that certain assets of choice communications became impaired  and as such  recorded a 
table of contents million impairment charge in its statement of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on the impairment charge 
our estimates of the future cash flows attributable to our long lived assets and the fair value of our businesses involve significant uncertainty 
those estimates are based on management s assumptions of future results  growth trends and industry conditions 
if those estimates are not met  we could have additional impairment charges in the future  and the amounts may be material 
we also assess the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis in accordance to sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of each reporting unit  including goodwill assigned to that reporting unit  is compared to its fair value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  an analysis is performed to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded 
we assess the recoverability of the value of our fcc licenses using a discounted cash flow valuation method 
we believe that our fcc licenses have an indefinite life based on historical ability to renew such licenses  that such renewals may be obtained indefinitely and at little cost  and that the related technology used is not expected to be replaced in the foreseeable future 
if the value of these assets was impaired by some factor  such as an adverse change in the subsidiary s operating market  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
we test the impairment of our fcc licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of fcc licenses with their carrying amount on a license by license basis 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  audits and other claims related to lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss accruals required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
we consult with legal counsel and other experts where necessary in connection with our assessment of any contingencies 
the required accrual for any such contingency may change materially in the future due to new developments or changes in each matter 
we estimate these contingencies amount to approximately million at december   the majority of which are not recorded on our books as we do not believe that an adverse outcome is probable 
adverse developments in these matters may result in the recording of liabilities to satisfy all or a portion of these claims

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange sensitivity 
gt t s functional currency is the us dollar because a significant portion of gt t s revenues and expenditures are transacted in us dollars 
the results of future operations nevertheless may be affected by changes in the value of the guyana dollar  however the guyanese exchange rate has remained at approximately guyana dollars to us dollar since and so we have not recorded any foreign exchange gains or losses since that date 
all of our other foreign subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions where the us dollar is the recognized currency 
interest rate sensitivity 
our exposure to changes in interest rates is limited and relates primarily to our variable interest rate long term debt 
as of december   million of our long term debt has a fixed rate by way of an interest rate swap that effectively hedges our interest rate risk 
the remaining million of long term debt as of december   is subject to interest rate risk 
as a result of our hedging policy we believe our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is not material
