our competitive strengths we believe that wowwee s key competitive strengths are in product development  engineering and design  including its ability to work with third party manufacturers  technology suppliers and intellectual property owners to develop innovative consumer technology based products 
we believe that wowwee s core competency is its ability to identify cutting edge technologies and  through its flexible design process  to incorporate these technologies in the development of innovative products 
the cinemin suite of products  incorporating texas instruments dlp technology  the flytech products  incorporating technologies that allow for unique performance capabilities and play patterns  roborover  loaded with features and content and very sharply priced  are some current examples of this core competency 
wowwee has developed robust partnerships with high quality chinese manufacturers that have demonstrated their commitment to wowwee by investing in advanced manufacturing methodologies and human resources to support wowwee s product development process 
wowwee s design and engineering team takes a hands on approach  managing these manufacturing relationships with a view to ensuring that each product is manufactured and assembled at the highest quality levels 
our business strategy we expect to implement specific strategies in order to enhance wowwee s growth and financial performance 
these strategies include expanding sales and distribution through a broadening of the sales channels  particularly outside north america  shifting reliance on an international distributor network to direct sales and distribution  refining product design  development and production capabilities to produce a broader assortment of products at varying price points  expanding development initiatives into products that combine computer connectivity  utility and entertainment  adjusting and smoothing out the seasonality of revenues  embarking on branded entertainment initiatives  licensing  publishing and merchandising  and evaluating potential acquisition opportunities 
our customers wowwee products are sold in a range of brick and mortar channels including grocery stores  pharmacies  toy shops  department stores and high end consumer technologies stores 
key north american retail customers include best buy costco home shopping jc penney macy s qvc radio shack sam s club sears k mart target toys r us wal mart each of these retail customers  as well as most other brick and mortar retail customers in the us  also carry the full line of wowwee products on their internet sales sites 
online sales of wowwee s products are also made through internet based e tailers such as amazon and buy 
com 
manufacturing wowwee s products are predominantly produced in china by third party manufacturers  many with whom wowwee has long standing relationships 
consistent with industry practice  the use of third party manufacturers allows wowwee to avoid incurring fixed manufacturing costs  while improving flexibility  capacity and production technology 
by outsourcing its manufacturing process  wowwee maintains a flexible business model that enables it to be responsive to changing technology 
in addition  once a product has reached its commercialization phase  wowwee is able to minimize inventory risk by manufacturing products based upon actual customer orders  however  certain customer orders may be subject to cancellation 
upon final assembly  products can be shipped directly from the manufacturing locations to retailers and distributors  with title to the products passing to retail customers in the country of origin 
although wowwee does not conduct the day to day manufacturing of its products  it is extensively involved in the design of the product prototype and production tools  dies and molds for its products and seeks to ensure quality control by actively reviewing the production process and testing the products produced by its manufacturers 
wowwee employs quality control inspectors who rotate among its manufacturers factories to monitor the production of substantially all of its products 
wowwee s quality assurance personnel advise as to compliance with applicable regulations during each phase of product development  and perform compliance testing  and coordinate third party independent compliance testing  on all wowwee products 
see government regulation below 
once pre production testing has been completed and product production has been approved  wowwee s quality assurance personnel monitor production at the manufacturer s facility for compliance with wowwee s quality requirements 
suppliers the principal raw materials used in the production and sale of wowwee s products are plastics  metals  plush  integrated circuits and standard electronic components  most of which are currently available from a variety of sources 
in certain instances  wowwee purchases components under license from the rights holder 
although wowwee does not manufacture its products  it owns the tools  dies and molds used in the manufacturing process  and these are transferable among manufacturers should wowwee choose to employ alternative manufacturers 
sales  marketing and distribution within the united states and canada  wowwee sells its products directly to its retailer customers through its direct sales channel  through independent sales representatives and through distributors 
as of january   wowwee products are sold to most european countries directly through wowwee europe  a recently established subsidiary resulting from the acquisition of sablon distribution sa  a former independent distributor see recent developments below 
for retailers in the rest of the world  wowwee utilizes a network of distributors located in various jurisdictions 
wowwee products are also available for sale through wowwee s internet based store http www 
wowweestore 
com 
in  approximately of its products were sold in north america  with the balance being sold internationally 
wowwee does not have written agreements with its customers 
instead  sales are made based on purchase orders  primarily against letters of credit 
the majority of orders are traditionally written during the first two quarters of the year  with shipments occurring throughout the year as new product becomes available 
the majority of the product shipments occur during the third and fourth quarters of the year 
wowwee presents products to its customers at trade shows  such as international ces  and various toy fairs  as well as at private meetings throughout the year 
wowwee generally introduces new products to its major customers during the year prior to the year of their introduction for retail sale 
wowwee employs a range of advertising and promotional vehicles to promote its products to consumers including broadcast  internet and print advertising  pr outreach  product placements and sampling and exhibition at consumer expositions 
wowwee also maintains a corporate website and individual sites for its brands and products 
wowwee products have been recognized for excellence in technology  design and quality by numerous organizations around the world  including over awards and commendations garnered by the product line 
in  products from the wowwee robotics product line were a featured toy in mcdonald s happy meal boys brand in europe  the middle east and latin america  following a successful program in most mcdonald s territories worldwide during research and development  product development wowwee s engineering and design team develops new technologies using internal capabilities and seeks to identify emerging or underutilized innovations that are currently being developed or that are available in the marketplace 
in order to leverage the man hours invested in prior products  older generations of products frequently form the foundation for the next generation of products as well as new product lines 
new technologies are then integrated to enhance the overall functionality of the product 
in sourcing technologies  wowwee reviews the latest technology innovations at trade shows  conferences  colleges and universities  on the internet  and through word of mouth 
wowwee regularly reviews technologies or product concepts from third party sources that it believes could have potential synergies with wowwee s current product line or that could be successfully commercialized based upon wowwee s development process 
wowwee generally brings all sought after third party technologies in house  but once inside  allows its internal engineering and design team to develop new product concepts with relative autonomy 
wowwee also licenses third party technologies for development within unique consumer applications developed by wowwee 
in the course of its product development  wowwee leverages its retail relationships to help gauge potential consumer demand 
wowwee conducts roadshow meetings with its key retail customers to solicit immediate feedback on its new product concepts 
based upon this early feedback  wowwee determines the course of further development or  as necessary  modifies the products 
in the early phases of product development  wowwee works with its third party manufacturers to engineer a manufacturing prototype to determine if the potential product can be manufactured on a commercially viable scale 
once further development work has been conducted  and a preliminary sample is available  wowwee moves to solicit further feedback from key retail customers  and begins to take preliminary orders for the product 
if the initial orders from these key retail customers indicates that the product might achieve sufficiently profitable unit sales  wowwee continues its development work and initiates the product tooling process with one of its product manufacturers 
safety testing of wowwee s products is done at the manufacturers facilities by quality control personnel employed by wowwee or by independent third party contractors engaged by wowwee 
safety testing is designed to ensure compliance with applicable product safety regulations see government regulation below 
in addition  certain of wowwee s larger customers use independent laboratories to test wowwee s products according to their own standards before shipment 
government regulation as a developer and supplier of consumer products  wowwee operates in a highly regulated environment in the united states and international markets 
in the united states  wowwee s products are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act cpsa  the american society for testing and materials astm  underwriters laboratories ul  the federal hazardous substances act fhsa  the flammable fabrics act ffa and the regulations promulgated thereunder  as well as the rules and regulations of the federal communications commission fcc rules 
the cpsa and the fhsa enable the consumer products safety commission cpsc to exclude from the market consumer products that fail to comply with applicable product safety regulations or otherwise create a substantial risk of injury  and articles that contain excessive amounts of a banned hazardous substance 
the ffa enables the cpsc to regulate and enforce flammability standards for fabrics used in consumer products 
the fcc rules require conformity with technical standards that limit radio frequency emissions in order to control potential interference to radio communications 
similar laws exist in various international markets 
wowwee maintains a quality control program designed to ensure compliance with all applicable laws see research and development  product development above 
regulations that apply to the sale of wowwee s products also include guidelines for advertising directed toward children 
competition wowwee competes with numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers  importers and marketers in each of its product categories 
globally  certain of wowwee s competitors have greater financial resources  larger sales and marketing and product development departments  stronger brand name recognition  longer operating histories and benefit from greater economies of scale 
intellectual property all of wowwee s products are produced and sold under trademarks owned by it or  in certain cases  licensed to it 
wowwee typically registers its trademarks in certain jurisdictions where its products are sold 
wowwee also files design patents in china and other jurisdictions for most of its products and has recently instituted a program under which utility patents will be filed where it is deemed appropriate as a means of protecting wowwee s proprietary technology 
wowwee maintains ownership of all of the tooling associated with its products 
employees as of december   we employed full time employees 
its employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit and it has never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe that our employee relations are good 
optimal payments optimal payments corp

fees charged to merchants typically include a discount rate  based upon a percentage of the dollar amounts processed  and a variety of fixed transaction fees 
merchant fees charged are based primarily upon the merchant s transaction volume 
other fees are derived from a variety of fixed transaction fees  including fees for monthly minimum charge volume requirements  statement fees  annual fees and fees for other miscellaneous items  such as handling chargebacks

item a 
risk factors an investment in our common shares involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common shares could decline due to any of these risks or other factors  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
the risks described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us 
if the current global economic conditions continue to deteriorate and the current financial crisis deepens  wowwee s business and our financial results may continue to be adversely affected 
the recent global economic deterioration and financial crisis adversely affected wowwee s business and our financial results in wowwee designs  manufactures and markets a wide variety of consumer robotic  toy and entertainment products worldwide 
wowwee s sales of these products are affected by the level of discretionary consumer spending  which has deteriorated sharply in the united states and in many countries around the world in which wowwee s products are sold 
consumers discretionary purchases of consumer robotic  toy and entertainment products may be negatively affected by job losses  foreclosures  bankruptcies  reduced access to credit  significantly falling home prices  lower consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors that curtail consumer spending behavior 
if wowwee s retail customers encounter liquidity problems due to weak retail sales or their inability to raise sufficient capital due to credit constraints  wowwee may not be able to collect accounts receivable from the affected customers 
finally  many of the ultimate effects and consequences of the current global economic crisis are not yet known 
any one or all of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on wowwee s liquidity and capital resources  including increasing our cost of capital or our ability to raise additional capital if needed  or otherwise negatively affect wowwee s business and our financial results 
liquidity problems or bankruptcy of wowwee s key customers could have a material adverse effect on wowwee s business  our financial condition and our results of operations 
many of wowwee s key customers are mass market retailers 
in the past  the mass market retail channel in the united states has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors  causing some large retailers to experience liquidity problems 
certain of wowwee s customers filed for bankruptcy in and the recent global economic crisis has adversely affected the financial condition of most retailers 
wowwee s sales to customers are typically made on credit without collateral 
there is a risk that customers will not pay  or that payment might be delayed because of bankruptcy  contraction of credit availability to such customers or other factors beyond wowwee s control  which could increase wowwee s exposure to losses from bad debts 
in addition  if these or other customers were to cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy or significantly reduce the number of stores operated  it could have a material adverse effect on wowwee s business  our financial condition  and our results of operations 
the nasdaq stock market has temporarily suspended the listing requirement that the closing bid price for a listed security not fall below per share for consecutive days 
if the bid price for our common stock does not increase above per share following the lifting of this temporary suspension  we may not be able to maintain our listing on the nasdaq global market  which would subject the trading of our common share to the sec s penny stock rules and would decrease the liquidity of our common shares 
our common shares are currently listed on the nasdaq global market nasdaq  which has quantitative maintenance criteria for the continued listing of our common shares that provide that a stock may be delisted if the closing bid price per share of such stock falls below for consecutive business days 
since december   the closing bid price per share of our common shares has been below 
however  due to the current extraordinary market conditions  as of october   nasdaq implemented a temporary suspension of its rules requiring a minimum closing bid price and of the rules requiring a minimum market value of publicly held shares requirements 
the suspension was extended on december  during the suspension  nasdaq will not take any action to delist any security for these concerns 
the suspension will remain in effect through friday  april  and these rules are currently scheduled to be reinstated on monday  april  if after the suspension is lifted  the closing bid price per share of our common shares continues to be below for a total of consecutive business days  our common shares could be delisted 
in accordance with nasdaq marketplace rules  we would have a period of calendar days to regain compliance after the receipt of a nasdaq staff deficiency letter by maintaining a closing bid price of per share for a minimum of consecutive business days 
if we do not regain compliance  we may appeal nasdaq s delisting determination to a nasdaq listing qualifications panel 
if we fail to maintain continued listing  our common shares may be traded over the counter on the otc bulletin board or in the pink sheets 
these alternative markets  however  are generally considered to be less efficient than  and not as broad as  nasdaq 
many otc stocks trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on the nasdaq markets  which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our common shares  and impair our ability to raise additional capital 
in addition  our common shares may become subject to penny stock rules 
the sec generally defines penny stock as an equity security that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
we are not currently subject to the penny stock rules because our common shares qualify for an exception to the sec s penny stock rules for companies that have an equity security that is quoted on the nasdaq stock market 
however  if our common shares were delisted  our common shares would become subject to the penny stock rules  which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell our common shares 
if our common shares were considered penny stock  the ability of broker dealers to sell our common shares and the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares in the secondary market would be limited and  as a result  the market liquidity for our common shares would be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that trading in our common shares will not be subject to these or other regulations in the future 
should our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments prove to be inadequate to meet our funding requirements  additional sources of funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our working capital requirements and cash flows are subject to quarterly and yearly fluctuations  depending on such factors as levels of sales  timing of deliveries and collection of receivables  inventory levels  customer payment terms and supplier terms and conditions 
our primary sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
should our amount of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at any time prove to be insufficient to meet our needs  due to the adverse effects  including adverse effects upon our cash flow  of any of the other risks  uncertainties  trends and other factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report  we may need to seek additional funds from external financing sources which may include a variety of debt and or equity financings  but these financings may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all with the result that our liquidity would be materially adversely affected 
any such adverse effect upon our liquidity could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the obligations of united bank card inc under the purchase and sale option agreement among optimal payments corp  united bank card  inc and jared isaacman  dated as of february   are unsecured and there is a risk that we will not receive payment in full of the purchase price payable there under 
on february   optimal payments corp 
entered into a purchase and sale option agreement with united bank card  inc and jared isaacman 
under the terms of the agreement  united bank card has the right to cause optimal payments corp 
to sell  and optimal payments corp 
has the right to require united bank card to purchase  optimal payments corp 
s right to residual payments and other ancillary revenues from the processing of credit card present transactions for a portfolio of merchant accounts 
the purchase price to be paid by united bank card under the agreement is million 
the purchase price will be subject to adjustment monthly by i subtracting revenues that have been retained by optimal payments corp 
after deducting payment to united bank card of fees relating to the servicing of the merchant accounts by united bank card and ii adding a notional rate of per annum to the resulting amount 
united bank card will be entitled to exercise its purchase right at any time up to december  and optimal payments corp 
will be entitled to exercise its sale right at any time on or following the earlier of i february  and ii the sale of united bank card 
united bank card s obligations under the agreement are being guaranteed by jared isaacman  however  neither united bank card s obligations nor jared isaacman s guarantee are secured 
if united bank card and jared isaacman were to default under their obligations  we might not be in a position to collect the purchase price as reduced pursuant to the adjustments described above and we might not find another buyer for the portfolio of residual payments and ancillary revenues 
our business depends upon the services of key personnel 
our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and to grow our business depends largely upon the services of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer  the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business and overall results of operations 
wowwee s future success depends largely on the continued contribution of its key executives  designers and technical personnel 
the loss of services of any of these key personnel could harm wowwee 
recruiting skilled designers and technical personnel is highly competitive 
if wowwee fails to retain any of these key personnel  and or fails to hire  train and integrate replacement personnel  it might not be able to maintain and expand its business  and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate businesses we acquire into our operations 
our future growth strategy may include acquiring other businesses 
for example  in november we acquired wowwee 
however  we may not be able to identify and acquire suitable target businesses or  to the extent required  obtain financing for such acquisitions on satisfactory terms or at all 
integrating acquired businesses into our operations may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating an acquisition  the diversion of management s attention from day to day operations  the difficulty in integrating widely dispersed operations with distinct corporate cultures  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business  the difficulty of incorporating acquired technologies successfully  the potential impairment of relationships with employees  customers and strategic partners  and the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies 
customer satisfaction or performance problems at an acquired business could adversely affect the reputation of our entire business 
future acquisitions may be financed through the issuance of common shares  which may dilute the ownership of our shareholders  or through the incurrence of indebtedness 
acquisitions may also result in significant charges to earnings 
furthermore  competition for acquisition candidates could escalate  thereby increasing the costs of making acquisitions or making suitable acquisitions more difficult to find 
we are subject to the risk that a taxation authority could challenge certain filing positions we have taken  and that a successful challenge could require us to pay significant additional taxes 
although we believe that all filing positions we take in our tax returns are reasonable and appropriate  there is no assurance that a taxation authority will not challenge those positions 
such challenges could include disputing positions taken in connection with the transfer of our online gaming processing business to fireone group plc and its affiliates in  and the subsequent public offering of a portion of the fireone group plc ordinary shares 
a challenge to certain filing positions we have taken  if successful  could result in us being required to pay additional taxes including penalties and interest and the amount of such additional taxes could be material to us 
we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar and euros 
the majority of our revenues are generated in us dollars and euros 
a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in both canadian dollars and euros 
a fluctuation in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar or the euro may result in variations in our revenues  expenses and earnings 
we have not implemented a currency hedging program 
our operating strategy for wowwee might not succeed and the anticipated benefits to us from our acquisition of wowwee might not be realized 
our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of the wowwee business will depend  in part  on the successful implementation of specific new strategies designed to enhance the growth and financial performance of the wowwee business 
these include expanding sales and distribution through a broadening of wowwee s sales channels  particularly outside north america in emerging markets  expanding product design  development and production capabilities to produce an increased number of products at varying price points  broadening development initiatives into products that combine computer connectivity  utility and entertainment  embarking on branded entertainment initiatives  licensing  publishing and merchandising  and evaluating potential acquisition opportunities 
if we fail to succeed in implementing these and other strategies that we might develop  wowwee could fail to grow  we may not realize the full benefits anticipated from the acquisition of the wowwee business  and our financial performance and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if wowwee does not satisfy consumer preferences our results of operations may be adversely affected 
wowwee competes with a wide range of manufacturers  marketers and sellers of consumer electronics and play products  many of which are larger than us and have greater financial resources than we do 
consumer preferences change 
if its competitors products achieve greater market acceptance than wowwee s products  wowwee s products are unable to satisfy consumer preferences  or wowwee fails to respond to changes in consumer preferences with products that achieve and sustain market acceptance in a timely and cost effective manner  demand for wowwee s products could decrease and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
wowwee s business is seasonal and its annual operating results depend  in large part  upon the relatively brief holiday season in the fourth quarter of the year 
retail sales of wowwee s products are susceptible to seasonal variations  with a majority of sales occurring between september and december 
as a result  wowwee s operating results depend  in large part  upon sales made during this period 
if wowwee s sales  operating earnings or cash flows from operating activities during the september to december period in any fiscal year are low  we may not be able to compensate sufficiently for the generally lower sales  operating earnings  or cash flows from operating activities during the first eight months of the fiscal year 
tighter inventory management by retailers resulting in shorter lead times for production and possible shipping disruptions during peak demand times may adversely affect wowwee s ability to deliver its products in time to meet retailer demands 
as retailers attempt to manage their inventories better by requiring suppliers to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell products to consumers  suppliers such as wowwee may have shorter lead times for production  and disruptions in shipping  for any reason  from china during peak demand times may affect the ability of wowwee to deliver its products in time to meet retailer demand 
wowwee s sales are concentrated among a relatively small number of major retailer customers  which exposes wowwee to any financial difficulties or changes in purchasing preferences or policies of these customers 
a small number of major retail customers account for a large proportion of wowwee s sales 
wowwee s customers make purchases by one time purchase orders  as opposed to making long term purchase commitments 
these customers could reduce their overall purchases of wowwee s products for any reason  including due to financial difficulties  or could reduce the shelf space allotted for such products 
any such change by a major customer of wowwee could significantly harm its business and our results of operations 
consolidation among wowwee s major customers could compound the effect upon us of any financial difficulties suffered by such customers or any changes in the purchasing preferences or policies of such customers 
increased consolidation among its customers could negatively impact the ability of wowwee to negotiate higher sales prices for its products and could result in lower gross profit margins 
all of wowwee s products are manufactured in china and we are subject to the risk that political developments  including currency revaluation and trade relations between china and the markets in which wowwee s products are sold  could increase the costs of producing and delay or prevent shipping such products 
all of wowwee s products are manufactured by third parties in the people s republic of china 
social and economic conditions in china affecting the movement of products from china to the markets in which wowwee s products are sold  particularly north america  and the labor and other costs of doing business in china could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 
factors that could negatively affect wowwee include a potential revaluation of the chinese yuan  which may increase the cost of producing products in china  increased labor costs and labor disputes that could result in difficulties in transporting products manufactured in china to the ports on the western coast of north america 
also  a negative change in china s trade status with the united states or the european union  including the imposition of trade sanctions  could significantly increase the cost of products imported from china 
any increase in the cost of producing and the cost of  or disruptions in  shipping wowwee s products in and from china could significantly adversely affect our results of operations 
a reduction or interruption in the supply of raw materials  parts and components or a significant increase in the price of supplies used to produce wowwee s products could negatively affect wowwee s gross profit margins 
wowwee may from time to time encounter shortages of materials  parts and components from its suppliers or a price increase in such materials  parts and components resulting from their shortage 
price increases for components such as resin used in plastics  rising fuel and transportation costs and raw material prices  may significantly increase wowwee s operating costs  reduce wowwee s gross profit margins and our results of operations 
due to market conditions  timing of pricing decisions  competition and other factors  there can be no assurance that wowwee will be able to offset any of such increased costs by adjusting the prices of its products because increases in the prices of wowwee s products could result in lower sales 
as a developer and supplier of consumer products  wowwee is subject to various government regulations  violation of which could subject us to sanctions 
as a developer and supplier of consumer products  wowwee operates in a highly regulated environment in the united states and international markets 
regulations that apply to its products and their importation include regulation of advertising directed toward children and product safety 
there can be no assurance that wowwee or its products will be in compliance in the future with such regulations 
in addition  changes in laws or regulations may lead to increased compliance related costs in wowwee s business 
failure to comply with such regulations could result in monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could have a negative impact on wowwee  our financial condition and our results of operations 
wowwee could also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall  the costs of which could be significant 
in addition  any product recall  regardless of direct costs of the recall  may harm consumer perceptions of wowwee s products 
wowwee could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls  which could harm wowwee 
products that have been or may be developed by wowwee may expose us to potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such products 
there can be no assurance that a claim will not be brought against us in the future 
while we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage  we may not be able to maintain such coverage or such coverage may not be adequate to cover all potential claims 
moreover  even if we maintain sufficient insurance coverage  any successful claim could significantly harm wowwee s reputation among consumers  which could result in decrease sales  harming our financial condition and our results of operations 
failure by wowwee to protect its proprietary intellectual property and information could have a material adverse effect on wowwee  our financial condition and results of operations 
the value of wowwee depends to a large degree on its ability to protect its intellectual property and information  including its trademarks  trade names  copyrights and trade secrets 
wowwee s business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting its products or infringing on its intellectual property rights 
any failure by wowwee to protect its proprietary intellectual property and information or a successful challenge by a third party that wowwee has infringed its intellectual property rights  could have a material adverse effect on wowwee  our financial condition and our results of operations 
optimal payments is at risk of loss due to fraud  disputes and merchant insolvency 
optimal payments faces risks of loss due to fraud and disputes between consumers and merchants  including the unauthorized use of credit card and bank account information and identity theft  merchant fraud  disputes over the quality of goods and services  breaches of system security  employee fraud and use of its system for illegal or improper purposes 
when a consumer pays a merchant for goods or services using a credit card and the cardholder disputes the charge  the amount of the disputed item gets charged back to optimal payments and the relevant credit card association may levy fees against optimal payments 
chargebacks can arise from the unauthorized use of a cardholder s card number or from a cardholder s claim that a merchant failed to perform a transaction 
in addition  if optimal payments chargeback or dispute rate becomes excessive  credit card associations may require it to pay fines and have done so in the past 
there is a risk that optimal payments may be required to pay fines in the future and the amount of such fines may be material 
while optimal payments attempts to recover from the merchant the amount charged back and the amount of any fines imposed upon it by credit card associations  optimal payments may not always be successful in doing so for various reasons  such as merchant insolvency 
optimal payments may not be able to safeguard against security and privacy breaches in its electronic transactions 
a significant element of electronic commerce and communication is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
although optimal payments strives to use only proven applications for premium data security and integrity to process electronic transactions  use of these applications may not be sufficient to address changing market conditions or developments in technology or the security and privacy concerns of optimal payments existing and potential customers 
optimal payments may not be able to prevent security or privacy breaches 
a security or privacy breach could expose optimal payments to liability and to potentially costly litigation  cause optimal payments to incur expenses relating to the remediation of these breaches  and cause optimal payments customers to lose confidence in its services  harm its reputation  and deter customers from using optimal payments services 
although optimal payments requires that its agreements with service providers who have access to merchant and consumer data include confidentiality obligations that restrict these parties from using or disclosing any consumer or merchant data except as necessary to perform their services under the applicable agreements  there can be no assurance that these contractual measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure of merchant or consumer data 
individuals may attempt to circumvent the measures that optimal payments takes to protect customer transaction data 
security breaches could result in the disclosure of proprietary information  such as bank account or credit card information 
if optimal payments is unable to protect the security and privacy of its electronic transactions and data  it could be exposed to risk of loss  litigation and possible liability  and its business volume  revenues and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
optimal payments payments systems might be used for illegal or improper purposes 
despite its measures to detect and prevent identity theft  unauthorized use of credit cards  and similar misconduct  and to monitor and comply with laws and regulations restricting or prohibiting the processing of certain types of transactions for its merchant customers  optimal payments payments systems are susceptible to illegal or improper uses by third parties 
these uses may include illegal online gaming  fraudulent sales of goods or services  illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances  software and other intellectual property piracy  money laundering  bank fraud  child pornography trafficking  prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products and online securities fraud 
illegal or improper use of payments systems may lead to increased government regulation of optimal payments or other legal consequences which may have an adverse impact on its revenues and results of operations 
in addition  laws or regulations that restrict or prohibit the business activities of optimal payments merchant customers may prevent optimal payments from providing  or may make it impracticable for it to continue to provide  its payments systems to such merchants and their customers  which would adversely affect its revenues and results of operations 
optimal payments must comply with credit card association rules and practices  which could impose additional costs and burdens on its payments business 
optimal payments must comply with the operating rules of the various credit card associations with which it is registered 
the associations could adopt operating rules with which it may be difficult or impossible for optimal payments to comply 
in addition  cases of fraud or disputes between consumers and merchants can result in chargebacks 
if optimal payments chargebacks or disputes become excessive  its processing suppliers could fine it or terminate its ability to accept credit cards for payments 
the termination of optimal payments relationships with credit card associations  or acquiring banks  would limit its ability to provide transaction processing services 
the failure of optimal payments systems  the systems of third parties or the internet could negatively impact its business and harm its reputation for reliability 
computer viruses  disgruntled or rogue employees  electronic break ins  power losses  telecommunications failures  security breaches  natural disasters and similar events could damage or disrupt the function of optimal payments systems and those of third parties upon whom it relies  such as bank processing and credit card systems  thereby adversely affecting optimal payments business and reputation 
optimal payments insurance policies may not adequately compensate it for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in these systems 
if optimal payments relationships with its banking partners deteriorated  its ability to process transactions could be impaired or halted 
optimal payments relies on strategic partnerships and suppliers to help supply  promote and distribute its services 
optimal payments particularly depends upon its strategic banking relationships 
the credit card association members and financial institutions that process electronic transactions have adopted guidelines that apply to online transactions 
while we believe that optimal payments operations comply with these guidelines  credit card association members and financial institutions could nonetheless decide in the future to refuse to process transactions for optimal payments 
such a decision could be implemented with little or no advance notice to optimal payments 
if such a situation occurred and optimal payments were not able to conclude alternative arrangements with other credit card association members or financial institutions  its ability to carry out payment transactions could be impaired or even halted 
optimal payments operates in a competitive market for its services 
potential competitors in optimal payments market include credit card association members  financial institutions  payment processors and other similar entities  many of which may have greater financial resources than optimal payment does  more firmly entrenched market positions or greater brand recognition 
optimal payments may not be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new services or offer new services that appeal to its customers as fast as its competitors 
if optimal payments fails to anticipate or respond effectively to customer requirements or experiences significant delays in product developments or roll outs  it may lose its market share and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
optimal payments relies upon non exclusive arrangements with independent sales agents to acquire and retain its customers 
optimal payments relies solely upon independent sales agents to acquire and retain its customers 
its arrangements with these independent sales agents are non exclusive 
as a result  optimal payments sales agents may enter into arrangements with optimal payments competitors that provide preferential treatment to those competitors or they may terminate their arrangements with optimal payments 
if optimal payments fails to maintain strong relationships with its independent sales agents or fails to provide its independent sales agents with sufficient incentives to motivate their sales efforts  optimal payments customer base may not expand and could decrease 
optimal payments business is subject to fluctuations in general business conditions 
the current downturn in general economic conditions has caused some of optimal payments merchant customers to experience difficulty in supporting their current operations and implementing their business plans 
if these merchants make fewer sales of their products and services  optimal payments will have fewer transactions to process  resulting in lower revenues 
in addition  in a recessionary environment  the merchants optimal payments serves become subject to a higher risk of insolvency  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
optimal payments bears the credit risk for chargebacks related to billing disputes between credit card holders and merchants 
if a merchant seeks protective relief under bankruptcy laws or is otherwise unable or unwilling to reimburse optimal payments for chargebacks borne by optimal payments  optimal payments may be liable for the full transaction amount of a chargeback 
the legal status of online gaming is uncertain in some of the jurisdictions in which optimal payments has provided settlement processing services for online gaming activities 
future enforcement proceedings may subject us to substantial penalties 
reports of enforcement proceedings that are unfavorable to optimal payments or to its customers or suppliers may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares 
in many jurisdictions there are few  if any  laws or regulations that deal directly with payment processing for online gaming transactions 
the legal status of online gaming itself is uncertain in many of the jurisdictions in which optimal payments has operated 
while some jurisdictions have taken the position that online gaming is legal and have adopted or are in the process of reviewing legislation to regulate online gaming  other jurisdictions have taken the opposite view and enacted legislation to attempt to restrict or prohibit online gaming 
for example  the united states unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of prohibits any person engaged in the business of betting or wagering from knowingly accepting payments related to unlawful bets or wagers transmitted over the internet  which resulted in our then majority owned subsidiary  fireone group plc  ceasing to process settlement transactions originating from united states customers that may be viewed as related to online gaming 
we may be exposed to adverse consequences as a result of future enforcement proceedings  governmental investigations or lawsuits initiated against optimal payments in jurisdictions where online gaming is restricted or prohibited  including the united states in the aftermath of the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of any adverse findings  rulings or judgments rendered against optimal payments could involve substantial penalties  fines  injunctions or other sanctions being invoked against it and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
any future enforcement or legal proceedings threatened or commenced against optimal payments relating to online gaming  whether or not ultimately successful  could involve substantial litigation expense and the diversion of the attention of key executives 
the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted 
from time to time  reports about regulatory initiatives  or enforcement proceedings that are or would be unfavorable to us  or to optimal payments customers or suppliers  have had a swift and negative impact on the trading price of our common shares  and our common shares may again experience trading price volatility in the future due to such reports 
optimal payments status under certain financial services regulations is unclear 
optimal payments operates in an industry subject to government regulation 
optimal payments currently is subject to money laundering regulations and may in the past have been subject to money transmitter or electronic money regulations in various jurisdictions 
if optimal payments is found to have been in violation of any such regulations  it could be exposed to financial liability  including substantial fines which could be imposed on a per transaction basis  and disgorgement of our profits 
we have a material amount of intangible assets which  if they become impaired  would result in a reduction in our net income 
current accounting standards require that goodwill and intangible assets be periodically evaluated for impairment 
goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquire 
we tested the goodwill of optimal payments for impairment at june  and we tested the remaining intangibles held in this segment for impairment at december  as a result of our analyses  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of approximately million in the second quarter of and an impairment charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of in addition  we tested the consumer  robotic  toy and entertainment segment for impairment at september  and at december   and at december  a goodwill impairment loss of approximately million and an impairment loss of approximately million on amortizable intangibles were recognized for this segment 
we also recorded goodwill impairment losses of million and million in and  respectively related to our discontinued operations 
after recording these impairment losses  at december   approximately million  or  of our total assets represented intangible assets 
any further declines in our assessment of future cash flows from the wowwee segment could result in a further write down of our intangible assets and a reduction in our net income 
we may be subject to additional litigation stemming from our operation of the u scan self checkout business 
in  we settled an action alleging that the u scan self checkout systems that we marketed infringed upon the claimant s patent 
in  and  a second party sent demand letters to us alleging a different patent infringement 
we may in the future be subject to other litigation relating to our prior involvement in the self checkout business 
defending against such litigation may be time consuming  expensive and distracting from the conduct of our current businesses  and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict 
the adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

overview we operated businesses in two segments during through wowwee our business segment established by the acquisition in november  and currently comprised of wowwee group limited  wowwee canada inc  wowwee usa  inc 
and ww sablon holdings  we design  develop  market and distribute technology based  consumer robotic  toy and entertainment products 
through optimal payments corp 
we process credit card payments for retail point of sale merchants 
on october   we sold substantially all of the assets of the payments processing segment that were used exclusively in the business of processing payments for card not present transactions for a cash consideration of million  and on august   we sold substantially all of the assets of the payment processing segment that were used exclusively in the business of processing payments for canadian card present transactions  for cash consideration of million with up to an additional million receivable in the future  contingent on the achievement of certain earnings goals 
the results of operations for these business segments are included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations  and the remaining assets and liabilities of these segments are classified as discontinued in the consolidated balance sheets 
subsequent to year end  we also entered into agreements for the sale of two portfolios of residual payments from merchant processing transactions for a total consideration of approximately million 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the remaining elements of the payment processing operations consist of two us card present merchant portfolios  both of which process credit card payments primarily for small and medium sized retail point of sale merchants and are wholly reliant on independent sales representatives 
we manage these operations through a management services agreement with a third party  we do not employ any people in connection with these two portfolios on august   we acquired sablon distribution sa  a distributor of toy products in the benelux countries  austria and germany  based in wauthier braine  belgium 
the acquisition strengthens and broadens wowwee s direct distribution model and positions wowwee closer to retailers and end users in sablon distribution s markets 
the former owners and senior management team of sablon distribution remain with the company and they continue to operate in the same capacities 
the acquisition was completed at an all cash price of approximately million eur million paid upon completion of the acquisition plus up to an additional million eur million payable in the first quarter of based upon the consolidated net equity of sablon distribution at the end of  as well as an earnout based on the consolidated net revenues of sablon distribution in each of and we expect the unfavorable economic conditions experienced in to continue into we also expect wowwee s revenues to be under pressure in as a result of a continued pull back in consumers willingness to spend and retailers desire to reduce inventories  weakening foreign exchange in international markets  and the sale of fewer entertainment related products in as a result  wowwee is managing its business based on reduced revenue assumptions and taking actions intended to improve gross margins and strengthen its balance sheet  including the following wowwee continues to focus on lower price point products wowwee continues to renegotiate product costs with vendors wowwee is reassessing its advertising spending and strategy with the expectation that advertising expense will be at the low end of its historical range wowwee intends to prudently manage its receivable and inventory levels wowwee is planning to tightly manage its capital expenditures 
we intend to focus on gross margins and the preservation of cash in see liquidity and capital resources current economic environment 
our industry segments we operated in two segments during wowwee consumer  robotic  toy and entertainment products and optimal payments payment processing see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
wowwee based in hong kong  with offices in carlsbad  california  new york  new york  wauthier braine  belgium  and montreal  quebec  wowwee designs  develops  markets and distributes technology based  consumer robotic  toy and entertainment products that can be sold at a variety of price points 
for  wowwee s product offering encompassed five distinct lines wowwee robotics  wowwee flytech  wowwee alive  wowwee technologies and think wow toys 
see item business for details of wowwee s product lines 
wowwee products are sold in a range of brick and mortar channels 
some of our retail customers in the us also carry certain wowwee products on their internet sales sites 
online sales of wowwee s products are also made through internet based e tailers such as amazon 
com and buy 
com 
wowwee s products are predominately produced in china by third party manufacturers with which wowwee has long standing relationships 
consistent with industry practice  the use of third party manufacturers allows wowwee to avoid incurring fixed manufacturing costs  while improving flexibility  capacity and production technology 
by outsourcing its manufacturing process  wowwee maintains a flexible business model that enables it to be responsive to changing technology 
in addition  once a product has reached its commercialization phase  wowwee is able to minimize inventory risk by manufacturing products based upon actual customer orders  nonetheless  certain customer orders may be subject to cancellation 
upon final assembly  products can be shipped directly from the manufacturing locations to retailers and distributors  with title to the products passing to retailer customers in the country of origin 
although wowwee does not conduct the day to day manufacturing of its products  it is extensively involved in the design of the product prototype and production tools  dies and molds for its products and seeks to ensure quality control by actively reviewing the production process and testing the products produced by its manufacturers 
wowwee employs quality control inspectors who rotate among its manufacturers factories to monitor the production of substantially all of its products 
wowwee s quality assurance personnel advise as to compliance with applicable regulations during each phase of product development  perform compliance testing and coordinate third party independent compliance testing on all wowwee products 
once pre production testing has been completed and product production has been approved  wowwee s quality assurance personnel monitor production at the manufacturer s facility for compliance with wowwee s quality requirements 
within the united states  canada and europe  wowwee sells its products directly to its retail customers through its direct sales channel and through independent sales representatives 
for retailers across the rest of the world  wowwee utilizes a network of distributors located in various jurisdictions 
in  wowwee intends to distribute its products in europe directly to retailers through sablon 
wowwee products are also available for sale through wowwee s internet based store http www 
wowweestore 
com 
in  approximately of its products were sold in north america  with the balance being sold internationally 
wowwee does not have written agreements with its customers 
instead  sales are made based on purchase orders  primarily against letters of credit 
the majority of orders are traditionally written during the first two quarters of the year  with shipments occurring throughout the year as new product becomes available 
the majority of product shipments occur during the third and fourth quarters of the year 
revenue is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii products are shipped to customers who assume risk of loss  iii collection of the respective receivable is probable and iv sales price is fixed or determinable 
accruals for customer discounts  rebates  incentives and allowances are recorded when the related revenues are recognized  as a reduction of revenues 
wowwee s engineering and design team develops new technologies using internal capabilities and seeks to identify emerging or underutilized innovations that are currently being developed or that are available in the marketplace 
in order to leverage the man hours invested in prior products  older generations of products frequently form the foundation for the next generation of products as well as new product lines 
new technologies are then integrated to enhance the overall functionality of the product 
in sourcing technologies  wowwee reviews the latest technology innovations at trade shows  conferences  colleges and universities  on the internet  and through word of mouth 
wowwee regularly reviews technologies or product concepts from third party sources that it believes could have potential synergies with wowwee s current product line or that could be successfully commercialized based upon wowwee s development process 
wowwee also licenses third party technologies for development within unique consumer applications developed by wowwee 
significant developments in this segment in on august   we acquired sablon distribution sa  a distributor of products in the benelux countries  austria and germany  based in wauthier braine  belgium

processes credit card payments for retail point of sale merchants 
optimal payments generates revenues primarily from fees charged to merchants for processing services 
fees charged to merchants typically include a discount rate  based upon a percentage of the dollar amounts processed  and a variety of fixed transaction fees 
merchant fees charged are based upon the merchant s transaction volume 
other fees are derived from a variety of fixed transaction fees  including fees for monthly minimum charge volume requirements  statement fees  annual fees and fees for other miscellaneous items 
discount and other fees related to payment transactions are recognized at the time the merchant s transactions are processed

seasonality revenue derived from the payments processing business segment is currently not subject to seasonality 
revenue from the wowwee business segment consumer robotic  toy and entertainment is subject to seasonal variability 
in  the majority of our net sales were made in the third and fourth quarters 
generally  the first quarter is the period of lowest shipments and sales in our business and the toy industry generally and therefore the least profitable due to various fixed costs 
seasonality factors will cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
our results of operations may also fluctuate as a result of factors such as the timing of new products and related expenses  the advertising activities of our competitors  delivery schedules set by our customers and the emergence of new market entrants 
we believe  however  that the low retail price of our lower priced products may be less subject to seasonal fluctuations than our higher priced toy products 
these seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times causes risk in our business associated with the underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of toys that do not match consumer demand 
retailers are also attempting to manage their inventories more tightly in recent years  requiring us to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers 
these factors increase the risk that we may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times  or that our own inventory levels may increase due to the need to pre build products before orders are placed 
in anticipation of retail sales in the traditional holiday season  the company significantly increases its production in advance of the peak selling period  resulting in a corresponding build up of inventory levels in the first three quarters of its fiscal year 
seasonal shipping patterns result in significant peaks in the third and fourth quarters in the respective levels of inventories and accounts receivable  which result in seasonal working capital financing requirements 
we ship products in accordance with delivery schedules specified by our customers  who usually request delivery of their products within three to six weeks of the date of their orders for orders shipped fob china or hong kong and within three days on orders shipped domestically 
because customer orders may be canceled at any time without penalty  our backlog may not accurately indicate sales for any future period 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with canadian gaap  which requires us to make numerous estimates and assumptions 
financial results as determined by actual events could differ from those estimates and assumptions  and therefore affect our reported results of operations and financial position 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies described here are those that are most important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements also involves significant management judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while best estimates have been used for reporting financial statement items subject to measurement uncertainty  management considers that it is possible  based on existing knowledge  that changes in future conditions in the near term could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 
near term is considered to be within one year from the date of the financial statements 
goodwill and other intangibles we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method 
accordingly  the purchase price of a business acquisition is allocated to its identifiable net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  on the basis of estimated fair values as at the date of purchase  with any excess being assigned to goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired at the date of acquisition using a projected discounted cash flow method and other valuation methods 
we make a number of significant estimates when calculating fair value using a projected discounted cash flow method 
these estimates include estimating projected future cash flows  the number of years used  the discount rate and others 
we believe that our estimates and valuation methods are reasonable 
they are consistent with our inherent planning and reflect our best estimates  but they have inherent uncertainties that management may not be able to control 
goodwill is not amortized but rather evaluated under an impairment approach 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  b significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and c significant negative industry or economic trends 
due to the subjective nature of the impairment analysis  significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect the conclusion regarding the future cash flows necessary to support the valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill 
the valuation of goodwill involves a high degree of judgment and consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value 
based on the assumptions underlying the valuation  impairment is determined by estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing that value to the reporting unit s book value 
if the fair value is more than the book value of the reporting unit  an impairment loss is not indicated 
if impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of its assets and liabilities excluding goodwill  with the excess amount representing the fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the book value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of that goodwill 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we generally use a present value technique discounted cash flow 
the factor most sensitive to change with respect to our discounted cash flow analyses is the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit which is  in turn  sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses 
if actual revenue growth and or margins are lower than our expectations  the impairment test results could differ 
we applied what we believe to be the most appropriate and consistent valuation methodology for each of the reporting units 
if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies  the impairment test results could differ 
other intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the amounts recorded as intangible assets at the date of acquisition represent the estimated fair value of these assets based on estimated future cash flows discounted at appropriate discount rates 
for intangibles with finite lives  we make estimates of future cash flows to be generated from the related assets 
in  we recorded impairment losses of million on goodwill and other intangibles relating to continuing operations and an additional million are recorded in the results from discontinued operations 
see results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the business environment  customers financial condition  historical collection experience  accounts receivable aging  customer disputes and the collectability of specific customer accounts 
if there were a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
the size of the allowance for doubtful accounts is also affected by the timing of the realization of uncollectible accounts receivable balances as well as the offsetting allowance 
major customers accounts are monitored on an ongoing basis  more in depth reviews are performed based on changes in a customer s financial condition and or the level of credit being extended 
when a significant event occurs  such as a bankruptcy filing by a specific customer  and on a quarterly basis  the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and the balance adjusted to reflect our current assessment of credit loss 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title transfer has occurred product shipment  the price is fixed or readily determinable  and collectability is probable 
sales are recorded net of sales returns and discounts  which are estimated at the time of shipment based upon historical data 
we routinely enter into arrangements with our customers to provide sales incentives  support customer promotions  and provide allowances for returns and defective merchandise 
such programs are based primarily on customer purchases  customer performance of specified promotional activities  and other specified factors such as sales to consumers 
accruals for these programs are recorded as sales adjustments that reduce gross revenue in the period the related revenue is recognized 
reserve for inventory obsolescence we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
based upon a consideration of quantities on hand  actual and projected sales volume  anticipated product selling prices and product lines planned to be discontinued  slow moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value 
failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in our under producing popular items or overproducing less popular items 
furthermore  significant changes in demand for our products would impact management s estimates in establishing our inventory provision 
management estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded  as an increase to cost of sales  when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard 
income taxes we provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method of tax allocation 
under this method  future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on deductible or taxable temporary differences between financial statement values and tax values of assets and liabilities using substantively enacted income tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance against future income tax assets if  based on available information  it is more likely than not that some or all of the future income tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the reliability of tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of the future tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
we considered the scheduled reversal of tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we accrue a tax reserve for additional income taxes and interest  which may become payable in future years as a result of audit adjustments by tax authorities 
the reserve is based on management s assessment of all relevant information  and is periodically reviewed and adjusted as circumstances warrant 
as of december   our income tax reserves are approximately million 
stock based compensation we use the fair value based method to account for stock based compensation and other stock based payments  such as stock options and restricted share units 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at fair value at the date of grant and is expensed over the award s vesting period 
the fair value of stock options granted is determined at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires certain assumptions  including future stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  and expected time to exercise 
changes to any of these assumptions  or the use of a different option pricing model  would result in different fair values for stock based compensation 
contingent liabilities our former gaming payment processing services segment derived a substantial portion of its revenue prior to october  from processing transactions from us based gaming 
therefore  we may be exposed to adverse consequences as a result of enforcement proceedings  governmental investigations or lawsuits initiated against us in jurisdictions where gaming is restricted or prohibited 
following announcements by the us attorney s office in the southern district of new york relating to its investigation of the us internet gambling industry  we announced on may  that we had initiated discussions with the us attorney s office in the southern district of new york and were in the process of responding to a voluntary request for information issued by the us attorney s office 
we have not recorded any provision for this matter because the outcome of these discussions and the amount of loss  if any  are not determinable 
while best estimates have been used for reporting financial statement items subject to measurement uncertainty  management considers that it is possible that changes in future conditions in the near term could require a material change in the recognized amounts of certain assets and liabilities 
near term is considered to be within one year from the date of the financial statements 
ogop payments inc has received a request for information from the us attorney s office in the eastern district of new york pertaining to its former involvement in processing transactions for internet pharmacies 
ogop payments inc has had discussions with that office relating to those processing activities 
no provision has been recorded by ogop payments inc for this matter because the outcome of these discussions and the amount of any loss  if any  are not determinable 
we are also party to litigation arising in the normal course of operations 
the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
should we fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several legal matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period  the consolidated operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 
recent accounting pronouncements a new accounting policies the following accounting standards have recently been issued by the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica  and the financial accounting standards board fasb that are relevant to our company 
references to fasb and statement of financial accounting standards sfas relate to us gaap and therefore may affect the note to our consolidated financial statements that discloses canadian us gaap differences 
capital disclosures on january   we adopted section  capital disclosures  which established guidelines for disclosure of both qualitative and quantitative information that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the entity s objectives  policies and processes for managing capital 
this new standard relates to disclosure only and did not impact our financial results 
financial instruments on january   we adopted section  financial instruments disclosure  which describes the required disclosure for the assessment of the significance of financial instruments for an entity s financial position and performance and of the nature and extent of risk arising from financial instruments to which the entity is exposed and how the entity manages those risks 
in addition  we adopted section  financial instruments presentation  which establishes standards for presentation of financial instruments and non financial derivatives 
it carries forward the presentation related requirements of section  financial instruments disclosure and presentation 
these new standards relate to disclosure only and did not impact our financial results 
inventories on january   we adopted section  inventories  which replaces section and harmonizes the canadian standards related to inventories with the international financial reporting standards ifrs 
this section provides changes to the measurement and more extensive guidance on the determination of cost  including allocation of overhead  narrows the permitted cost formulas  requires impairment testing  and expands the disclosure requirements to increase transparency 
the adoption of this standard did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
fair value measurements on january  we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the standard did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
b future accounting pronouncements the following accounting pronouncements have recently been issued by the cica and the fasb and may be relevant to our company 
references to fasb and sfas relate to us gaap and therefore may affect the note to our consolidated financial statements that discloses canadian us gaap differences 
goodwill and intangible assets in february  the cica issued section  goodwill and intangible assets  which will replace section  goodwill and other intangible assets and section  research and development costs 
the standard provides guidance on the recognition of intangible assets in accordance with the definition of an asset and the criteria for asset recognition  as well as clarifying the application of the concept of matching revenues and expenses  whether these assets are separately acquired or internally developed 
this standard applies to interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after october  we expect that the adoption of this standard will not have a significant effect on our financial results 
international financial reporting standards in february  canada s accounting standards board acsb confirmed that canadian gaap as used by publicly accountable enterprises will be fully converged with ifrs  as issued by the international accounting standards board iasb 
the changeover date is for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after january  we are currently assessing the future impact of these new standards on the consolidated financial statements 
business combinations and consolidations in january  the cica issued cica handbook section  business combinations  section  consolidations  and section  non controlling interests 
these sections will replace the former cica handbook section  business combinations and section  consolidated financial statements and establish a new section for accounting for a non controlling interest in a subsidiary 
cica handbook section establishes standards for the accounting for a business combination  and states that all assets and liabilities of an acquired business will be recorded at fair value 
obligations for contingent considerations and contingencies will also be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date 
the standard also states that acquisition related costs will be expensed as incurred and that restructuring charges can only be recorded when the definition of a liability is met  which will generally result in these amounts being expensed in the periods after the acquisition date 
it provides the canadian equivalent to ifrs  business combinations january 
the section applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after january  and early adoption is permitted 
cica handbook section establishes standards for the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
cica handbook section establishes standards for accounting for a non controlling interest in a subsidiary in the preparation of consolidated financial statements subsequent to a business combination 
it is equivalent to the corresponding provisions of ifrs international accounting standards ias  consolidated and separate financial statements january 
cica handbook section and section apply to interim and annual consolidated financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after january  earlier adoption of these sections is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year 
all three sections must be adopted concurrently 
we are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of these sections 
credit risk and fair value in january  the cica issued eic  credit risk and the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities  which clarifies that the credit risk of counterparties should be taken into account in determining the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
the eic will be adopted on january  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant effect in our financial results 
sfas no 
r  business combinations in december  the fasb issued a revised standard on accounting for business combinations 
the major changes to accounting for business combinations include the following all business acquisitions will be measured at fair value  the existing definition of a business would be expanded  certain pre acquisition contingencies would be measured at fair value  most acquisition related costs would be recognized as expenses are incurred they would no longer be part of the purchase consideration  obligations for contingent consideration would be measured and recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition measurement and recognition would no longer be dependent on settlement of the contingency  non controlling interests would be measured at fair value at the date of acquisition ie  of the assets and liabilities would be measured at fair value even when an acquisition is less than  goodwill  if any  arising on a business combination reflects the excess of the fair value of the acquiree  as a whole  over the net amount of the recognized identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and would be allocated to the acquirer and the non controlling interest 
the statement is effective for periods beginning on or after january  we will apply the standard for acquisitions occurring after this date 
sfas no 
non controlling interest in consolidated financial statements in december  the fasb issued a revised standard on accounting for non controlling interests and transactions with non controlling interest holders in consolidated financial statements 
this revised standard specifies that non controlling interests are to be treated as a separate component of equity  not as a liability or other items outside of equity 
because non controlling interests are an element of equity  increases and decreases in the parent s ownership interest that leave control intact are accounted for as capital transactions rather than as a step acquisition or dilution gains or losses 
the carrying amount of the non controlling interests is adjusted to reflect the changes in ownership interests  and any difference between the amount by which the non controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity attributable to the controlling interests 
this standard requires net income and comprehensive income to be displayed for both the controlling and the non controlling interests 
additional required disclosures and reconciliations include a separate schedule that shows the effects of any transactions with the non controlling interests on the equity attributable to the controlling interests 
the statement is effective for periods beginning on or after december  sfas will be applied prospectively to all non controlling interests  including any that arose before the effective date 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment to fasb statement no 
in march  the fasb issued the above noted statement  which requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments  and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features on derivative agreements 
the statement is effective for periods beginning on or after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to materially affect our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles and sfas accounting for financial guarantee insurance contracts in may  the fasb issued the above noted statements 
we do not expect the adoption of these statements to affect our consolidated financial statements 
financial condition as at december   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  compared to million as at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments is primarily due to business acquisitions million  as well as cash used in operations million and the purchase of property and equipment and intangibles million  off set by proceeds received from the sale of card not present and canadian card present payment processing assets million 
we have various credit facilities through our subsidiaries located in belgium and hong kong  of which million were used at december  of this amount  million was assumed at the date of the sablon acquisition

working capital as at december  was million  as compared to million at december  this decrease is due primarily to cash used in the acquisition of sablon distribution  cash used in operations and the purchase of property and equipment and intangibles  off set by proceeds received from the sale of card not present and canadian card present payment processing assets 
accounts receivable as at december  were million  as compared to million at december  the increase of million resulted primarily from the acquisition of sablon distribution 
inventories as at december  were million  as compared to million at december  the increase of million resulted from an increase of million of raw materials due to a greater amount of product lines in and an increase of finished goods of million due to the acquisition of sablon distribution 
as a result of the impairment losses recorded during  we have no goodwill as at december   compared to million of goodwill as at december  see the explanation of impairment losses below 
intangible assets decreased by million  from million as at december  to million as at december  this decrease is due primarily to amortization during the year of million and impairment losses of million  offset by acquisitions of million 
shareholders equity as at december  was million  as compared to million as at december  the decrease is attributable primarily to our net loss  which includes the impairment of goodwill for the period 
quarterly results the following table sets forth certain summarized unaudited quarterly financial data for the periods presented 
the financial data has been derived from unaudited financial statements that  in the opinion of management  reflect all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of such quarterly data 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
the unaudited financial statements are prepared on the basis of canadian gaap  which is different in some regards from us gaap 
the following quarterly results are adjusted to present the revenues of the canadian card present and card not present payment processing businesses as discontinued operations  and include the results of operations of wowwee and sablon from november  and august   respectively  the dates of acquisition

results of operations on october   we sold substantially all of the assets of the payments processing segment that were used exclusively in the business of processing payments for card not present transactions for a cash consideration of million  and on august  we sold substantially all of the assets of the payment processing segment that were used exclusively in the business of processing payments for canadian card present business for cash consideration of million with up to an additional million receivable in the future  contingent on the achievement of certain earnings goals 
the results of operations for these businesses are included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations  and the remaining assets and liabilities of these businesses are classified as discontinued in the consolidated balance sheets 
on august   we acquired sablon distribution sa  a distributor of products in the benelux countries  austria and germany  based in wauthier braine  belgium 
the acquisition strengthens and broadens wowwee s direct distribution structure and positions wowwee closer to retailers and end users in sablon distribution s markets 
the former owners and senior management team of sablon distribution remain with the company and they continue to operate in the same capacities 
the acquisition was completed at an all cash price of approximately million eur million paid upon completion of the acquisition plus up to an additional million eur million payable in the first quarter of based upon the consolidated net equity of sablon distribution at the end of  as well as an earnout based on the consolidated net revenues of sablon distribution in each of and compared with excluding amounts classified as discontinued operations revenues increased by million from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to the acquisition of wowwee in november and our acquisition of sablon distribution in august in  revenues in the consumer robotic  toy and entertainment segment were million  compared to million in revenues in comprised a full year of activity from the wowwee acquisition and four months of activity from the sablon distribution acquisition completed on august  in  revenues in this segment were comprised of revenues from wowwee from november  the date of acquisition 
revenues in payment processing decreased from million to million as a result of the sale of the card not present and canadian card present payment processing assets in  as previously described 
in january and february  we sold two other payment processing portfolios in this segment and expect revenues and costs to decline significantly in we expect to focus our activities on the consumer robotic  toy and entertainment segment in the future approximately of revenues were derived from customers located in the united states in compared to in we expect this percentage to decline in as a result of the sablon acquisition  which will result in greater european sales  and the sale of the payment processing businesses 
cost of sales and transaction processing excluding amortization increased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  due primarily to the acquisition of wowwee in november and our acquisition of sablon distribution in august amortization of intangibles pertaining to cost of sales and transaction processing costs increased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the increase in amortization is due primarily to the intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of wowwee in november and our acquisition of sablon distribution in august selling  general and administrative expenses excluding amortization and stock based compensation increased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is due primarily to our acquisition of wowwee in november and our acquisition of sablon distribution in august the stock based compensation pertaining to selling  general and administrative expense is attributable to the accounting for the fair value of stock options granted 
stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  increased by million  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to options issued in november  and to a modification to the expiry date of options issued in from april  to april  since these options were vested at the date of modification  the incremental value of the fair value of the modified options of million was expensed in research and development expense increased by million during the year  from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  research and development expenses are comprised primarily of personnel related expenditures associated with the development of new products in the wowwee business segment 
amortization of property and equipment pertaining to costs of sales increased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to the addition of capital assets as a result of the wowwee and sablon distribution acquisitions 
impairment losses were recorded in both the consumer robotic  toy and entertainment and payment processing segments 
in the consumer robotic  toy and entertainment segment  impairment losses were recorded due largely to a general deterioration of the economic environment 
sales  operating profits and cash flows in the consumer robotic  toy and entertainment products segment were lower than expected in we tested the consumer robotic  toy and entertainment segment for impairment at september  and december  we revised our forecast for the next five years to reflect lower growth expectations for this segment 
at december   a goodwill impairment loss of million and an impairment loss of million on amortizable intangibles was recognized for this segment 
the fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
in addition  at june   we tested goodwill for impairment in the payment processing segment as we determined that there was a more likely than not expectation that a significant portion  or this entire segment  would be sold over the course of the following months 
as a result of this analysis  the goodwill in the segment was determined to be impaired since the estimated fair value to be realized as proceeds from transactions would be less than the carrying value of the segment including goodwill 
as a result  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment loss of million in the second quarter of we also tested the remaining intangibles held in the payment processing segment at december  for impairment as we determined that there was a more likely than not expectation that a significant portion of these intangibles would be sold over the course of the next twelve months 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million at december  based on the estimated fair value to be realized as proceeds from these transactions 
the recovery for income taxes was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  significant components of our tax provision include the effect of the goodwill impairment loss in the amount of million and of stock based compensation in the amount of million  which are not deductible for tax 
other significant components of our provision are the change in the valuation allowance of million  which reflects an increase in the benefit of losses not recorded  and an increase of million caused by differences in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant components of our tax provision include the change in valuation allowance of million 
our tax provision includes the effect of future taxes on unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses  which arise upon the conversion into canadian dollars of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in us dollars for purposes of determining taxable income under canadian income tax regulations 
since the us dollar is our measurement currency and our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars  these foreign exchange gains losses do not impact earnings before income taxes 
in  our tax provision includes a future tax charge of million related to unrealized foreign exchange compared to a recovery of million in with respect to future income tax assets  as at december  we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million million related to assets that we determined were not more likely than not to be realized 
our ability to ultimately realize these future income tax assets is dependent upon our future profitability within the allowable carry forward period  thus creating sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of these assets 
our net loss in was million or per share basic and diluted  compared to net loss of million per share basic and diluted in ebitda was a loss of million or per diluted share for compared to ebitda of million or per diluted share for a reconciliation of this non gaap financial information is presented in the table below 
we use non gaap measures to assess our operating performance 
securities regulations require that companies caution readers that earning and other measures adjusted to a basis other than gaap do not have standardized meanings and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used by other companies 
accordingly  they should not be considered in isolation 
we use ebitda to measure our performance from one period to the next without the variation caused by certain adjustments that could potentially distort the analysis of trends in our operating performance  and because we believe it provides meaningful information on our financial condition and operating results 
ebitda  as we use it  is calculated as earnings before investment income  taxes and depreciation and amortization and excludes the impacts of impairment loss  stock based compensation and discontinued operations 
we believe it is useful to exclude these items as they are either non cash expenses  items that cannot be influenced by management in the short term  or items that do not impact core operating performance 
excluding these items does not imply they are necessarily non recurring

the decrease in revenue in our payments processing segment was due primarily to the cessation  in october  of payment processing for the us gaming business as a result of the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of  in the united states 
cost of sales and transaction processing increased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the increase in transaction processing costs and cost of sales was due to our acquisition of wowwee in november amortization of intangibles pertaining to transaction processing costs and cost of sales increased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the increase in amortization is due primarily to the intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of wowwee in november selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is due primarily to the reduction of our payments processing business segment 
approximately million of these expenses are attributed to wowwee 
the stock based compensation pertaining to selling  general and administrative expense is attributable to the accounting for the fair value of stock options and restricted share units granted 
stock based compensation expense of million was incurred for the year ended december  research and development expenses of million were incurred during the year ended december  research and development expenses are comprised primarily of personnel related expenditures associated with the development of products in the wowwee business segment

in  our tax provision includes a future tax recovery of million related to unrealized foreign exchange compared to a recovery of million in with respect to future income tax assets  as at december  we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million million related to assets that we determined were not more likely than not to be realized

accordingly  they should not be considered in isolation 
we use ebitda to measure our performance from one period to the next without the variation caused by certain adjustments that could potentially distort the analysis of trends in our operating performance  and because we believe it provides meaningful information on our financial condition and operating results 
ebitda  as we use it  is calculated as earnings before investment income  taxes and depreciation and amortization and excludes the impacts of impairment loss  stock based compensation and discontinued operations 
we believe it is useful to exclude these items as they are either non cash expenses  items that cannot be influenced by management in the short term  or items that do not impact core operating performance 
excluding these items does not imply they are necessarily non recurring 
reconciliation of non gaap financial information expressed in thousands of us dollars  except per share amounts twelve months ended december  unaudited unaudited net loss earnings add deduct amortization of intangibles pertaining to cost of sales and transaction processing amortization of equipment pertaining to cost of sales amortization of equipment pertaining to selling  general and administrative stock based compensation pertaining to selling  general and administrative investment income income tax provision loss gain from discontinued operations ebitda diluted shares ebitda per diluted share liquidity and capital resources as at december   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  compared to million as at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments is primarily due to business acquisition million  cash used in operations million and the purchase of property and equipment and intangibles million  off set by proceeds received from the sale of card not present and canadian card present assets million in the payment processing business segment 
we have various credit facilities through our subsidiaries located in belgium and hong kong  of which million were used at december  of this amount  million was assumed at the date of the sablon distribution acquisition 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we intend to finance our operations from available cash resources and existing credit lines 
we expect to use less cash from operations in compared to by managing costs in line with reduced revenue expectations and reducing our investments in working capital 
as at december   our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  net of bank indebtedness  totaled million 
operating activities used million of cash and cash equivalents in  as compared to using million in this decrease in use is due mainly to a decrease in use of cash from discontinued operating assets and liabilities 
cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was million in compared to cash generated of million in the decrease in is primarily due to the increased loss from operations  as well as additional investments in working capital accounts receivable and inventories in compared to financing activities generated million of cash in  compared to using million in in  we utilized additional financing from available credit facilities in belgium and hong kong of million 
in  we repaid the bank indebtedness of million 
investing activities from continuing operations generated million of cash in  compared with million in the decrease of approximately million can be explained primarily by the following increases in  proceeds from dispositions of property and equipment and businesses increased by million  in  million less cash was used for acquisitions  and in  transaction costs related to business acquisitions and disposals decreased by million 
decreases in  million less cash was generated on the maturity of short term investments  and in  purchases of property  equipment and intangibles increased by million 
current economic environment the downturn in the global economy had a significant effect on the toy industry and our company 
consumer confidence reached an all time low in december of  driving retail sales weakness in the fourth quarter as consumers  fearful of the economy s direction  cut back their discretionary spending 
toy retailers and manufacturers were impacted by the economic downturn  with estimates a significant number of chinese toy manufacturers closing their operations and significant toy sellers in the us  us  mexico  and other major markets closing their operations or entering bankruptcy 
as a result of lower than expected sales  margins and cash flows in the consumer robotic  toy and entertainment segment  we recorded goodwill impairment losses of million in we expect the unfavourable economic conditions experienced in to continue into we also expect revenues to be under pressure in as a result of a continued pull back in consumers willingness to spend and retailers desire to reduce inventories  weakening foreign exchange in international markets  and the sale of fewer entertainment related products in as a result  we are managing our business based on reduced revenue assumptions and taking actions intended to improve margins and strengthen our balance sheet 
risk management strategies are likely to evolve in response to future conditions and circumstances  including the effects and consequences resulting from the current economic downturn 
these future strategies may not fully insulate us in the near term from adverse effects  the more significant of which relate to liquidity and capital resources as well as exposure to credit losses 
we expect to focus on margins and conserve cash in as a result  we are planning to tightly manage our inventories  capital expenditures and other spending activity in we expect that some of our customers and vendors may experience difficulty in obtaining the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials 
our focus for is on strengthening our balance sheet and managing costs in line with anticipated reduced revenues with the goal of improving the profitability and cash flows generated by our business 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be adequate to meet our needs for at least the next months 
we have no financial obligations of significance  including any off balance sheet arrangements  other than long term lease commitments for our premises in the united states  canada and hong kong 
these are summarized in note a of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the timing of our contractual commitments during the next five years and thereafter  related to our operating leases  is as follows in thousands of us dollars contractual obligations total to to thereafter operating leases long term debt we have granted two letters of guarantee  issued by highly rated financial institutions to indemnify third parties in the event that we do not perform their contractual obligations 
as at december   the maximum potential liability under these letters of guarantee was million 
we have not included long term liabilities related to discontinued operations of million in the above table because these will only be settled upon resolution of the investigation by the us attorney s office see note e of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity table december  carrying value fair value thousands of us dollars notes denominated in us dollars  with a weighted average effective yield of  maturing on march  total fair value has been determined based upon quoted market values as at december  interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates 
short term investments consist of short term notes invested at fixed interest rates 
the risk that we will realize a loss as a result of a decline in the fair value of these investments is limited because although available for sale  these investments are short term and are generally held to maturity 
we are exposed primarily to interest rate fluctuations as a result of cash and bank indebtedness which bears interest at variable interest rates 
a increase in the interest rate would have decreased the net loss and comprehensive loss by million in the twelve month period ended december  an equal but opposite effect would result assuming a decrease in interest rates 
a significant portion of our cash flows and financial assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars  which is our functional and reporting currency 
foreign currency risk is limited to the portion of our business transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars  primarily for head office expenses in canada and european operations 
our foreign currency transactions fluctuate in the respective exchange rates relative to the us dollar which will create volatility in our cash flows and the reported amounts for revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses in its consolidated statement of operations on a period to period basis 
additional earnings variability arises from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar at the rates of exchange at each balance sheet date  the impact of which is reported as a foreign exchange gain and loss which is included as part of selling  general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
our objective in managing our foreign currency risk is to minimize our net exposures to foreign currency cash flows  by transacting with third parties in us dollars to the maximum extent possible and practical and holding cash and cash equivalents in us dollars 
we monitor and forecast the values of net foreign currency cash flow and balance sheet exposures and with the aid of external consultants manage our cash flow to hold on hand sufficient levels of foreign currencies to meet our obligations 
from time to time  we engage in the use of derivative financial instruments to manage our currency exposure 
note b of the notes to our consolidated financial statements presents an indication of our significant foreign currency exposures 
based on these exposures  a weakening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar and euro would have increased the net loss and comprehensive loss in by million 
as assumed strengthening of the us dollar would have an equal but opposite effect on our net loss
