item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our business the kroger co 
was founded in and incorporated in it is one of the nation s largest retailers  as measured by revenue  operating  supermarket and multi department stores under two dozen banners including kroger  ralphs  fred meyer  food less  king soopers  smith s  fry s  fry s marketplace  dillons  qfc and city market 
of these stores  have fuel centers 
we also operate convenience stores and fine jewelry stores 
kroger operates manufacturing plants  primarily bakeries and dairies  which supply approximately of the corporate brand units sold in our retail outlets 
our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores 
we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers 
such costs include procurement and distribution costs  facility occupancy and operational costs  and overhead expenses 
our operations are reported as a single reportable segment the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers 
our performance by focusing on the customer through our customer st strategy  we were able to report solid results for fiscal year in a particularly tough economy 
at the beginning of the year  we expected to grow supermarket identical sales  excluding fuel  by to 
for  supermarket identical sales  excluding fuel  were  meeting the upper end of our original guidance 
at the outset of fiscal year  kroger s earnings guidance was a range of to per diluted share 
our earnings was per diluted share or per diluted share  excluding the effect of a 
per diluted share charge for damage and disruption caused by hurricane ike 
our earnings of per diluted share  excluding the charge for damage and disruption caused by hurricane ike  represents a growth rate of over kroger s full year earnings of per diluted share 
we believe that this growth plus kroger s dividend yield of more than  creates a strong return for shareholders 
our market share also rose in based on our internal data and analysis  we estimate that our market share increased approximately basis points in across our major markets 
we define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores 
this is the fourth consecutive year kroger has achieved significant market share gain 
over the past four years combined  kroger s market share in our major markets has increased approximately basis points 
market share is critical to us because it allows us to leverage the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base 
we hold the number one or number two market share position in of or our major markets 
our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share 
these market share results demonstrate to us that our long term strategy is working 
as population growth continues in the major markets where we operate  we intend to continue to grow kroger s business by maintaining our existing strong market share and by building on additional opportunities for sales growth 
we estimate that approximately of the share in our major markets as much as billion is held by competitors who do not have kroger s economies of scale 
our economies of scale allow us to deliver increasing value to customers  which is a competitive edge  particularly in today s economic climate 
kroger s business model is structured to produce sustainable earnings per share growth in a variety of economic and competitive conditions  primarily through strong identical sales growth 
we believe this is the right approach to produce sustainable earnings growth over a long period of time 
we recognize that continual investment in our customer st strategy is necessary to drive strong  sustainable identical sales growth 
we believe that this customer st strategy along with our financial strategies are delivering value to customers  shareholders  bondholders  and our associates  and so we remain committed to our plan 
results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for compared to and for compared to comparability is affected by certain income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods

sales total sales in millions percentage increase percentage increase total food store sales without fuel total food store fuel sales total food store sales other sales total sales other sales primarily relate to sales at convenience stores  including fuel  jewelry stores and sales by our manufacturing plants to outside customers 
the growth in our total sales in over fiscal was primarily the result of identical supermarket sales increases  increased fuel gallon sales  and inflation across most departments 
identical supermarket sales and total sales  excluding fuel  increased due to increased transaction count and average transaction size  and inflation across all departments 
after adjusting for the extra week in fiscal  total sales increased in over fiscal we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters 
fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below 
differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage 
annualized identical supermarket sales include all sales at the fred meyer multi department stores 
we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales 
our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below  based on the week period of  compared to the week period of the previous year 
the identical store count in the table below represents the total number of identical supermarkets as of january  and february  identical supermarket sales in millions including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers identical th quarter store count we define a supermarket as comparable when it has been in operation for five full quarters  including expansions and relocations 
as is the case for identical supermarket sales  fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket comparable sales results calculations illustrated below 
annualized comparable supermarket sales include all fred meyer multi department stores 
we calculate annualized comparable supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of comparable sales 
our annualized comparable supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below  based on the week period of  compared to the same week period of the previous year 
the comparable store count in the table below represents the total number of comparable supermarkets as of january  and february  comparable supermarket sales in millions including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers comparable th quarter store count fifo gross margin we calculate first in  first out fifo gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs  including advertising  warehousing and transportation  but excluding the last in  first out lifo charge 
merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expense 
fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness 
our fifo gross margin rates were in  in and in our retail fuel sales reduce our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales 
excluding the effect of retail fuel operations  our fifo gross margin rates decreased basis points in  basis points in and basis points in the decrease in our non fuel fifo gross margin rate reflects our continued reinvestment of operating cost savings into lower prices for our customers 
in addition  fifo gross margin in  compared to  decreased due to high inflation in product costs 
lifo charge the lifo charge was million in  million in and million in like many food retailers  we continued to experience product cost inflation in at levels that have not occurred for several years 
this increase in product cost inflation caused the increase in the lifo charge in  compared to and in addition  product cost inflation in  compared to  caused the increase in the lifo charge in compared to operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative og a expenses consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages  health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs  utilities and credit card fees 
rent expense  depreciation and amortization expense  and interest expense are not included in og a

og a expenses  as a percent of sales excluding fuel  decreased basis points in  basis points in and basis points in the decrease in our og a rate in  excluding the effect of retail fuel operations  was primarily the result of increased identical supermarkets sales growth and a settlement received from credit card processers  partially offset by the million charge related to hurricane ike and increases in credit card fees and health care costs 
the decrease in our og a rate in  excluding the effect of retail fuel operations  was primarily the result of strong identical sales growth  increased productivity  and progress that was made in in controlling our utility  health care and pension costs 
these improvements were partially offset by increases in credit card fees 
excluding the effect of retail fuel operations and expenses recorded for one time legal reserves  our og a rate declined basis points in rent expense rent expense was million in  as compared to million in and million in rent expense  as a percent of sales  was in  as compared to in and in the decrease in rent expense  as a percent of sales  reflects our increasing sales and our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing whenever possible 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense was billion in  billion in and billion in the increases in depreciation and amortization expense were the result of capital expenditures totaling billion in  billion in and billion in depreciation and amortization expense  as a percent of sales  was in  in and in the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in  compared to  as a percent of sales  is primarily the result of increasing sales 
the increase in our depreciation and amortization expense in  compared to  as a percent of sales  is due to an annual depreciation charge in both years with containing weeks of sales due to the structure of our fiscal calendar 
interest expense net interest expense totaled million in  million in and million in the increase in interest expense in  compared to  was primarily the result of an increase in the average total debt balance for the year  partially offset by interest income related to the mark to market of ineffective fair value swaps 
the decrease in interest expense in  compared to  was the result of replacing borrowings with new borrowings at a lower interest rate 
the average total debt balance in was comparable to income taxes our effective income tax rate was in  in and in the effective tax rates for those years differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes 
in addition  the effective tax rate for differs from the expected federal statutory rate due to the resolution of some tax issues 
the effective rate in includes an adjustment of some deferred tax balances 
during the third quarter of  we resolved favorably some outstanding tax issues 
this resulted in a tax benefit of approximately million and reduced our effective tax rate by 
in  during the reconciliation of our deferred tax balances  and after the filing of our annual federal and state tax returns  we identified adjustments to be made in prior years deferred tax reconciliation 
we corrected these deferred tax balances in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended february   which resulted in a reduction of our fiscal provision for income tax expense of approximately million and reduced the rate by 
we do not believe these adjustments are material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended february   or to any prior years consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we have not restated any prior year amounts 
common stock repurchase program we maintain stock repurchase programs that comply with securities exchange act rule b and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common stock  from time to time 
we made open market purchases totaling million in  billion in and million in under these repurchase programs 
in addition to these repurchase programs  in december we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans 
this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises  and the tax benefit from these exercises 
we repurchased approximately million in  million in and million in under the stock option programs 
in  to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility  we reduced the amount of stock repurchased during the year  decreasing the cash used for stock purchases in  compared to capital expenditures capital expenditures  including changes in construction in progress payables and excluding acquisitions  totaled billion in compared to billion in and billion in the increase in capital spending in compared to and was the result of increasing our focus on remodels  merchandising and productivity projects 
the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage supermarket storing activity beginning of year opened opened relocation acquired acquired relocation closed operational closed relocation end of year total food store square footage in millions critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
self insurance costs we primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims 
the liabilities represent our best estimate  using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods  of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january  we establish case reserves for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known 
for both workers compensation and general liability claims  we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits 
we account for the liabilities for workers compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate 
a basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately million 
general liability claims are not discounted 
we are also similarly self insured for property related losses 
we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of million on a per claim basis  except in the case of an earthquake  for which stop loss coverage is in excess of million per claim  up to million per claim in california and million outside of california 
the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability  which can affect the liability recorded for such claims 
for example  variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized 
similarly  changes in legal trends and interpretations  as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs 
our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
impairments of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred 
these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
when a trigger event occurs  we perform an impairment calculation  comparing projected undiscounted cash flows  utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores  to the carrying value for those stores 
if we identify impairment for long lived assets to be held and used  we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value 
fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows 
we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value 
with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal  we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value  reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal 
we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling million in  million in and million in we record costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as operating  general and administrative expense 
the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows 
our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation  the economy and market competition 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as reviewing long lived assets for impairment at a different organizational level  could produce significantly different results 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and also upon the occurrence of trigger events 
we perform reviews at the operating division level 
generally  fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings  or discounted projected future cash flows  and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment 
we base projected future cash flows on management s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future 
if we identify potential for impairment  we measure the fair value of a division against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the division s goodwill 
we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the division s goodwill over the implied fair value 
if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units  we would need to recognize an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the division s goodwill over the implied fair value 
results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during  and are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level  could produce significantly different results 
similar to our policy on impairment of long lived assets  the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items such as inflation  business valuations in the market  the economy and market competition 
store closing costs we provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date  net of estimated subtenant income 
we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores 
we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores  which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years 
adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known 
we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs  or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose  is adjusted to earnings in the proper period 
we estimate subtenant income  future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located  our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets  inflation rates and general economic conditions 
we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value 
we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property  equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets 
we classify inventory write downs in connection with store closings  if any  in merchandise costs 
we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred 
post retirement benefit plans a company sponsored defined benefit pension plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas  which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet 
we record  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  actuarial gains or losses  prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized 
we adopted the measurement date provisions of sfas effective february  the majority of our pension and postretirement plans previously used a december measurement date 
all plans are now measured as of our fiscal year end 
the non cash effect of the adoption of the measurement date provisions of sfas decreased shareowners equity by approximately million million after tax and increased long term liabilities by approximately million 
there was no effect on our results of operations 
the determination of our obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions  including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets  may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability 
the objective of our discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
in making this determination  we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans 
our methodology for selecting the discount rate as of year end was to match the plan s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity 
benefit cash flows due in a particular year can be settled theoretically by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year 
the discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows 
the selection of the discount rate as of year end represents the equivalent single rate under a broad market aa yield curve constructed by an outside consultant 
we utilized a discount rate of for year end the basis point increase in the discount rate decreased the projected pension benefit obligation as of january   by approximately million 
to determine the expected return on pension plan assets  we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories 
for and  we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 
our pension plan s average return was for the calendar years ended december   net of all investment management fees and expenses  primarily due to the poor performance of the financial markets in the value of all investments in our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december   net of investment management fees and expenses declined 
we believe our pension return assumption is appropriate because we expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performances as the very long term historical average annual return for example  the s p index has returned annually on a compound basis for the years ending december  for the various markets in which the plan invests 
we have been advised that during  the trustees plan to increase the allocation of non core assets  including high yield debt securities  commodities and real estate 
collectively  these changes should improve the diversification of pension plan assets 
the trustees have advised us that they expect these changes will have little effect on the total portfolio risk but will increase the likelihood of achieving the expected rate of return 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 
sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger s pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below in millions 
percentage point change projected benefit obligation decrease increase expense decrease increase discount rate expected return on assets we contributed million in  million in and million in to our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans 
although kroger is not required to make cash contributions to its company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during fiscal  we made a million cash contribution on february  additional contributions may be made if required under the pension protection act to avoid any benefit restrictions 
we expect any voluntary contributions made during will reduce our minimum required contributions in future years 
among other things  investment performance of plan assets  the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations  and future changes in legislation  will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 
net periodic benefit cost decreased in and compared to due to participants in the cash balance formula of the consolidated retirement benefit plan being moved to a defined contribution k retirement savings account plan effective january  participants under that formula continue to earn interest on prior contributions but no additional pay credits will be earned 
the k retirement savings plan provides to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from kroger based on participant contributions  plan compensation  and length of service 
we contributed and expensed million in and million in to employee k retirement savings accounts 
b multi employer plans we also contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements 
these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers 
the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose 
trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions 
the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 
we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded  in accordance with gaap 
we made contributions to these plans  and recognized expense  of million in  million in  and million in based on the most recent information available to us  we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits 
we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets  ie  the amount of underfunding  as of december  because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans  we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of kroger s contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing kroger s share of the underfunding 
nonetheless  the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of kroger or of any employer 
as of december   we estimate that kroger s share of the underfunding of multi employer plans to which kroger contributes was billion  pre tax  or billion  after tax 
this represents an increase in the amount of underfunding estimated as of december   compared to december  the increase in the amount of underfunding is attributable to the recent market downturn 
our estimate is based on the best information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others  and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 
our estimate is imprecise and not necessarily reliable 
we have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger 
rather  we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences 
in  our contributions to these plans increased approximately over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately since we do not expect a significant increase in our contributions to multi employer pension plans in  compared to  subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions 
we believe our contributions to multi employer pension plans could as much as double over the next several years  after  to reduce this underfunding 
finally  underfunding means that  in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds  we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability 
any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated  in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations  returns on the assets held in the multi employer plans and benefit payments 
the amount could decline  and kroger s future expense would be favorably affected  if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining  trustee action or favorable legislation 
on the other hand  kroger s share of the underfunding could increase and kroger s future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline  if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining  trustee action or adverse legislation 
deferred rent we recognize rent holidays  including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements  as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
fair value of financial instruments in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a market based framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not expand or require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial assets and financial liabilities for fiscal years beginning after november  fasb staff position fsp partial deferral of the effective date of statement no 
fsp  deferred the effective date of sfas for most non financial assets and non financial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  effective february   we adopted sfas  except for non financial assets and non financial liabilities which are deferred until february  by fsp sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by sfas are as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable  level unobservable pricing inputs in which little or no market activity exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
for those financial instruments carried at fair value in the consolidated financial statements  the following table summarizes the fair value of these instruments at january  fair value measurements using in millions quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level significant other observable inputs level significant unobservable inputs level total available for sale securities variable interest entities in december  the fasb issued fas and fin r  disclosures by public entities enterprises about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities fas and fin r 
fas and fin r require additional disclosures about an entity s involvement with variable interest entities and transfers of financial assets 
effective january   we adopted fas and fin r in the first quarter of  we made an investment in the little clinic llc tlc 
tlc operates supermarket walk in medical clinics in seven states  primarily in the midwest and southeast 
at the date of investment  tlc was determined to be a variable interest entity vie under fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  with kroger being the primary beneficiary 
we were deemed the primary beneficiary due to our current ownership interest and half of our written put options being at a floor price 
as a result  we consolidated tlc in accordance with fin r 
the minority interest was recorded at fair value on the acquisition date 
the fair value of tlc was determined based on the amount of the investment made by kroger and the percentage acquired 
our assessment of goodwill represents the excess of this amount over the fair value of tlc s net assets as of the investment date 
creditors of tlc have no recourse to the general credit of kroger 
conversely  creditors of kroger have no recourse to the assets of tlc 
in addition  if requested by tlc s board of directors by january   we have agreed to make a pro rata portion of an additional capital contribution

r  share based payment sfas r 
under this method  we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after january   as well as all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize share based compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  over the requisite service period of the award 
in addition  we account for restricted stock awards under sfas r 
we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award  over the period the awards lapse 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market 
in total  approximately in and in of inventories were valued using the lifo method 
cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the fifo method 
replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by million at january   and by million at february  we follow the link chain  dollar value lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 
we follow the item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions 
this method involves counting each item in inventory  assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold 
the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting 
we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities 
we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 
vendor allowances we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold 
in most cases  vendor allowances are applied to the related product by item  and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item 
when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item  we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold 
we recognized approximately billion in  billion in and billion in of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs 
we recognized more than of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow information net cash provided by operating activities we generated billion of cash from operations in compared to billion in and billion in the increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to strong operating results adjusted for non cash expenses 
in addition  changes in our operating assets and liabilities also affected the amount of cash provided by our operating activities 
we realized decreases in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of million in  million in and million in the increase in the change in operating assets and liabilities in  compared to  is primarily due to an increase in income taxes receivable 
the increase in the change in operating assets and liabilities in  compared to  is primarily attributable to an increase in forward inventory buying activity

accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  as amended 
we had prefunded employee benefit costs of million in each of the three years ended  and the mark to market adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by million in and million in factors affecting liquidity we currently borrow on a daily basis approximately million under our f p a rated commercial paper cp program 
these borrowings are backed by our credit facility  and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility 
we have capacity available under our credit facility to backstop all cp amounts outstanding 
if our credit rating declines below its current level of bbb baa bbb  the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating 
this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility  under which we believe we have sufficient capacity 
however  in the event of a ratings decline  we do not anticipate that access to the cp markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time ie  in excess of days 
although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating  the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our applicable percentage ratio 
our credit facility also requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our financial covenants 
a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility 
these financial covenants and ratios are described below our applicable percentage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated total interest expense  as defined in the credit facility was to as of january  our current borrowing rates are determined from the better of our applicable percentage ratio or our credit ratings as defined by the credit facility 
our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit facility was to as of january  if this ratio exceeded to  we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired 
our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense  as defined in the credit facility was to as of january  if this ratio fell below to  we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired 
consolidated ebitda  as defined in our credit facility  includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses 
our credit agreement is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments  based on year of maturity or settlement  as of january  in millions of dollars thereafter total contractual obligations long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations low income housing obligations financed lease obligations self insurance liability construction commitments purchase obligations total other commercial commitments credit facility standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees total the contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  which totaled approximately million in this table also excludes contributions under various multi employer pension plans  which totaled million in we adopted fin on february  see note to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the adoption of fin the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined 
amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of january  applicable to our variable interest debt instruments  excluding commercial paper borrowings due to the short term nature of these borrowings  and stated fixed and swapped interest rates  if applicable  for all other debt instruments 
the amounts included in the contractual obligations table for self insurance liability have been stated on a present value basis 
long term debt includes amounts under our credit facility which are also included in the other commercial commitments table 
our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction 
these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business  such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities 
our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties 
any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of january   we maintained a billion  five year revolving credit facility that  unless extended  terminates in outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings  and some outstanding letters of credit  reduce funds available under the credit agreement 
in addition to the credit agreement  we maintained three uncommitted money market lines totaling million in the aggregate 
the money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates  usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement 
as of january   we had no borrowings under our credit agreement and net outstanding commercial paper of million  that reduced amounts available under our credit agreement 
in addition  as of january   we had borrowings under our money market lines totaling million 
the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled million as of january  in addition to the available credit mentioned above  as of january   we had authorized for issuance billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december  we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured workers compensation claims 
these bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and are placed with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self insured retention levels 
these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger  as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs 
market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and  in some instances  availability of these bonds may become more limited  which could affect our costs of  or access to  such bonds 
although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds  if this does become an issue  we would issue letters of credit  in states where allowed  against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements 
this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 
most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co 
and some of our subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements 
in addition  we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate entities in which we have ownership interest 
our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness  should the entities be unable to meet their obligations  totals approximately million 
based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of january   it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations 
we have also agreed to guarantee  up to million  the indebtedness of an entity of which we have ownership interest 
our share of the responsibility  as of january   should the entity be unable to meet its obligations  totals approximately million and is collateralized by approximately million of inventory located in our stores 
in addition  we have guaranteed half of the lease payments of a location leased by an entity in which we have a ownership interest 
the net present value of the guaranteed rental payments is approximately million 
we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions 
we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations 
due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties  and various other remedies available to us  we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 
we have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses  including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities 
in addition to the above  we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business 
such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to kroger  indemnities related to the sale of our securities  indemnities of directors  officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work  and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans 
while kroger s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability  we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability

outlook this discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about kroger s future performance 
these statements are based on management s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available 
such statements relate to  among other things projected change in net earnings  identical sales growth  expected pension plan contributions  our ability to generate operating cash flow  projected capital expenditures  square footage growth  opportunities to reduce costs  cash flow requirements  and our operating plan for the future  and are indicated by words such as comfortable  committed  will  expect  goal  should  intend  target  believe  anticipate  and similar words or phrases 
these forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations  projections  beliefs  intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate  uncertainties about the general economy  our labor relations  our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially 
we expect earnings per diluted share in the range of for this represents earnings per share growth of approximately in  excluding the per diluted share charge in related to hurricane ike 
in addition  our shareholder return is enhanced by our dividend by over 
we expect identical supermarket sales growth  excluding fuel sales  of in  assuming product cost inflation of 
in  we will continue to focus on driving sales growth and balancing investments in gross margin and improved customer service to provide a better shopping experience for our customers 
we expect to finance these investments with operating cost reductions 
we expect non fuel operating margins to improve slightly in  excluding the benefit of an expected lower lifo charge 
in  we expect fuel margins to be approximately per gallon  as well as continued strong growth in gallons sold 
in  we expect the lifo charge to be million  assuming product cost inflation of 
we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital investments  debt reduction and to pay cash dividends 
as market conditions change  we plan to re evaluate the above uses of cash flow and our stock repurchase activity 
we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage  as well as from increased productivity from existing locations 
capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion  as well as focusing on productivity increase from our existing store base through remodels 
in addition  we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate  logistics and technology improvements 
the continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations  logistics  manufacturing procurement  category management  merchandising and buying practices  and should reduce merchandising costs 
we intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements 
we expect capital investment for to be in the range of billion  excluding acquisitions 
total food store square footage is expected to grow approximately before acquisitions and operational closings 
based on current operating trends  we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity  including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility  will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future 
we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions 
we believe we have adequate sources of cash if needed under our credit agreement 
we expect that our og a results will be affected by increased costs  such as higher pension costs and credit card fees  as well as any potential future labor disputes  offset by improved productivity from process changes and leverage gained through sales increases 
we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately we expect rent expense  as a percent of total sales and excluding closed store activity  will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate 
we believe that in there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration  productivity improvements  shrink  warehousing and transportation 
these savings will be invested in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers 
although we were not required to make cash contributions to company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during and do not anticipate being required to do so in  we contributed million to these plans in and we made a million contribution in on february  we expect any elective contributions made during will decrease our required contributions in future years 
among other things  investment performance of plan assets  the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations  and future changes in legislation  will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 
we also expect expense for company sponsored defined benefit pension plans to be comparable to in addition  we expect our cash contributions and expense to the k retirement savings account plan from automatic and matching contributions to participants to increase in  compared to we do not expect a significant increase in our contributions to multi employer pension plans in compared to subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions 
in addition  we believe our contributions to multi employer pension plans could as much as double over the next several years after we expect our expense from the credit extended to our customers through our company branded credit card in to be comparable to of million 
the expense represents an increase in net charge offs of approximately million  compared to  due to the weak economy  higher outstanding balances  and portfolio maturation 
this rate is still below the credit card industry average and the credit portfolio continues to have an above average credit score 
various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals 
these include the extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the impact that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates 
our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit  including our bank credit facilities  could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us 
we have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in  covering associates in albuquerque  arizona  atlanta  dallas  dayton  denver and portland 
in all of these store contracts  rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations 
a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material effect on our results 
if market conditions change  it could affect our uses of cash flow 
our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may be affected by labor disputes  industry consolidation  pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors  including non traditional competitors  our response to these actions  the state of the economy  including the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities  trends in consumer spending  stock repurchases  and the success of our future growth plans 
our estimate of product cost inflation could be affected by general economic conditions  weather  availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging  and other factors beyond our control 
the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by expected food inflation during the year 
if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units and variable interest entities  an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the division s goodwill over the implied fair value would need to be recognized 
in addition to the factors identified above  our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in kroger private label sales  the effect of our sister stores new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store and reductions in retail pricing 
our operating margins  without fuel  could fail to slightly improve as expected if we are unable to pass on any cost increases  fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differs from our expectations 
our expected operating margin per gallon of fuel and fuel gallons sold could be affected by changes in the price of fuel or a change in our operating costs 
we have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business  as well as to the material litigation facing kroger  and believe we have made adequate provisions for them where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where we believe an adverse outcome is probable 
unexpected outcomes in these matters  however  could result in an adverse effect on our earnings 
consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business  either favorable or unfavorable  cannot be foreseen 
rent expense  which includes subtenant rental income  could be adversely affected by the state of the economy  increased store closure activity and future consolidation 
depreciation expense  which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases  is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets  or the remaining terms of leases 
use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation was followed 
our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws  the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses 
the actual amount of automatic and matching cash contributions to our k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of participants  savings rate  plan compensation  and length of service of participants 
our contributions and recorded expense related to multi employer pension funds could increase more than anticipated 
should asset values in these funds further deteriorate  if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability  or should our estimates prove to be understated  our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated  after if weakness in the financial markets continues or worsens  our contributions to company sponsored defined benefit pension plans could increase more than anticipated 
changes in laws or regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements 
changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions  including the rate of inflation  population growth and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate  may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores 
this would negatively affect earnings and sales growth 
general economic changes may also affect the shopping habits of our customers  which could affect sales and earnings 
changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators 
for example  we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base 
since gasoline generates low profit margins  we expect to see our fifo gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase 
although this negatively affects our fifo gross margin  gasoline sales provide a positive effect on og a expense as a percent of sales 
our capital expenditures  expected square footage growth  and number of store projects completed during the year could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores  if development costs vary from those budgeted or if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget 
interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment  changes in the company s credit ratings  fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt  decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely affects our operations and results in an increase in debt 
impairment losses could be affected by changes in our assumptions of future cash flows or market values 
our cash flow projections include several years of projected cash flows and include assumptions on variables such as inflation  the economy and market competition 
our estimated expense and obligation for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits could be affected by changes in the assumptions used in calculating those amounts 
these assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs 
adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products  or may decrease the customer demand for certain products 
increases in demand for certain commodities could also increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products 
additionally  increases in the cost of inputs  such as utility costs or raw material costs  could negatively affect financial ratios and earnings 
although we presently operate only in the united states  civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods 
if we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers  our fifo gross margin and net earnings will suffer 
other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information 
accordingly  actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in  contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure  fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 
we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt  and interest rate swaps 
our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates 
to do this  we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure  ii limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of billion or less  iii include no leveraged products  and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status 
as of january   we did not have any outstanding interest rate swaps designated as fair value or cash flow hedges 
in  we terminated nine fair value interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million 
three of these terminated interest rate swaps were purchased and became ineffective fair value hedges in the proceeds received at termination were credited to interest expense in the amount of million 
we have unamortized proceeds from twelve interest rate swaps once classified as fair value hedges totaling approximately million 
the unamortized proceeds are recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt 
in addition to the interest rate swaps noted above  in we entered into three forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling million 
a forward starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates on debt for an established period of time 
we entered into the forward starting interest rate swaps in order to lock into fixed interest rates on forecasted issuances of debt in and in  we terminated two of these forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million 
in  we terminated the remaining forward interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
the unamortized payments and proceeds on these terminated forward starting interest rate swaps have been recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings as the payments of interest to which the hedge relates are made 
as of february   other long term liabilities totaling million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements 
annually  we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines 
the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 
the table below provides information about our underlying debt portfolio as of january  the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long term debt  excluding capital leases as of january  interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments 
the variable component of each variable rate debt is based on the us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january  the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments as of january  refer to notes  and of our consolidated financial statements expected year of maturity thereafter total fair value in millions debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate commodity price protection we enter into purchase commitments for various resources  including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores  warehouses  manufacturing facilities and administrative offices 
we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business 
those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases 
some of the product we purchase is shipped in corrugated cardboard packaging 
we sell corrugated cardboard when it is economical to do so 
as of january   we maintained a derivative instrument to manage exposure to changes in corrugated cardboard prices 
this derivative has a three year term 
the instrument does not qualify for hedge accounting  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  as amended 
accordingly  the change in the fair value of this instrument is marked to market in our consolidated statements of operations in og a expenses 
as of january   the fair value of this instrument was insignificant
