item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies and use of estimates  and note to the accompanying financial statements 
the million of capitalized water costs on our balance sheet represent the costs of the water rights we own and the related infrastructure developed to provide water and wastewater services 
we own or have the exclusive rights to use water in several river basins throughout colorado  with our most significant assets being located in the denver metropolitan area and the arkansas river basin in southern colorado 
each of these assets is explained in detail below 

table of contents rangeview water supply and the lowry range our rangeview water our rangeview water supply defined below includes a total of approximately  acre feet of tributary surface water   acre feet of nontributary and not nontributary groundwater rights  and storage rights associated with the lowry range 
of the  acre feet of lowry range groundwater  we own approximately  acre feet of non tributary and not nontributary groundwater which we can export from the lowry range to supply water to nearby communities and developers in need of additional water supplies this water asset is referred to as our export water 
we also have the right to convert up to  acre feet of the export groundwater to a similar amount of surface water for use off the lowry range 
we hold the exclusive right to develop and deliver through the remaining  acre feet of groundwater  along with the balance of the surface water  for use on the lowry range 
collectively we refer to these as our rangeview water supply 
we acquired our rangeview water supply in april pursuant to the following agreements  which collectively are referred to as the rangeview water agreements i the amended and restated lease agreement the lease between the state board of land commissioners the land board and the rangeview metropolitan district the district  a quasi municipal political subdivision of the state of colorado  ii the agreement for sale of export water between us and the district  and iii the service agreement between us and the district for the provision of water service to the lowry range 
pursuant to the rangeview water agreements  we design  construct  operate and maintain the district s water and wastewater systems to provide water and wastewater service to customers within the district s  acre service area at the lowry range 
in exchange for providing water service  we receive of all amounts received by the district relating to water services  after deducting the required royalty to the land board  which initially totals of gross revenues received from water sales 
the rangeview water agreements require us to charge customers fair market rates for water service based on the average of similar rates and charges at three nearby communities 
see the water and wastewater tap fees section below 
pursuant to the wastewater service agreement the wastewater agreement between us and the district  we also design  finance  construct  operate and maintain the district s wastewater system to provide wastewater service to customers within the district s service area 
in exchange for providing wastewater services  we receive of the district s wastewater tap fees and of the district s monthly wastewater service fees  as well as the right to use or sell the reclaimed water 
on the lowry range  we operate both the water and the wastewater systems during our contract period on behalf of the district  who owns the facilities for both systems 
at the expiration of our contract term in  ownership of the water system facilities servicing customers on the lowry range will revert to the land board  with the district retaining ownership of the wastewater facilities 
off the lowry range  we use our export water as well as other supplies owned by us to provide water service to our customers and we own these facilities 
historically we have contracted with third parties for the construction of these facilities  which is a practice we plan to continue 
the lowry range property the lowry range was acquired by the land board in the s and according to the land board it is one of the most complex and visible properties held in trust by the land board 
located in unincorporated arapahoe county  about miles southeast of metro denver  the lowry range is one of the largest contiguous parcels under single ownership next to a major metropolitan area in the united states 
the lowry range is approximately  acres in size or about square miles of land 
of the  acres  we have the exclusive rights to provide water and wastewater services to approximately  acres 

table of contents in december  the land board selected two development partners for the lowry range  one for a parcel designated by the land board as the development parcel including approximately  acres of the lowry range and one for a parcel designated as the conservation parcel including approximately  acres 
in june  the land board entered into an agreement with a developer for sole development rights of six sections of the lowry range 
of this  we have the exclusive rights to provide water and wastewater services to two sections or approximately  acres 
as further detailed in item a risk factors  in january  the developer withdrew from the project 
we continue to work with the land board to develop the lowry range water assets for customers located on and off the lowry range using the lowry range s surface and groundwater supplies in conjunction with a water management program to provide state of the art  environmentally sensitive  sustainable water and wastewater services  at commercially reasonable rates 
the land board to date has not finalized an agreement on the conservation parcel with its tentative partner 
despite the developer s withdrawal  our agreements with the district and the land board remain intact and we remain the exclusive water service provider to  acres of the lowry range 
the land board continues to own the property and has stated its desire to continue to pursue its three part vision for the lowry range which includes land development  conservation  and water resource development 
however  we are not aware of any other projects planned by the land board and it may be some time before the land board commences another project 
beginning in the s and continuing with the lease  we have been a dedicated partner with the land board in the pursuit of development opportunities at the lowry range 
we continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to provide water and wastewater services to the lowry range and we look forward to continuing to work with the land board on these important and valuable assets 
additionally  on june   the colorado supreme court upheld the decision of the district court  water division i  state of colorado water court requiring the city of aurora aurora to remove three reservoir sites from its water court applications because the reservoir sites were already adjudicated to us pursuant to agreements with the land board 
this process began in when aurora filed an application for conditional water rights with the water court in which aurora listed numerous potential sites for reservoirs for storage of its water rights 
three of the potential reservoir sites were located on the lowry range on reservoir sites which had been adjudicated by the district and the land board and for which the land board had previously granted the right to obtain rights of way and to construct reservoirs to the district 
water supplies and water storage reservoirs are competitively sought throughout the west and along the front range of colorado 
we believe regional cooperation among area water providers in developing new water supplies and water storage provides the most cost effective way of expanding and enhancing service capacities for area water providers 
we continue to discuss developing water supplies and water storage opportunities with area water providers 
arkansas river water we own approximately  acre feet of senior water rights in the arkansas river basin 
currently this water is being used for agricultural purposes on the approximately  acres of real property we own in southern colorado  which is being leased to area farmers 
the water rights we own are represented by over  shares of the fort lyon canal company the flcc  which is a non profit mutual ditch company established in the late s to operate and maintain the mile long fort lyon canal between la junta  colorado and lamar  colorado 
we acquired these assets on august   from high plains a m  llc hp a m pursuant to an asset purchase agreement the arkansas river agreement 
pursuant to agreements we entered into with hp a m  described in greater detail in note to the accompanying financial statements  the management of these farm leases is being performed by hp a m through august  after that date  depending on certain factors described in the accompanying financial statements  hp a m may extend the management services agreement  or we may assume management of the farms 
pursuant to the management services agreement  while hp a m is managing the leases  hp a m is responsible for all expenses associated with maintaining the leases with the exception of the water assessment fees paid to the flcc  which fees are borne by us 
as compensation for their management responsibilities  hp a m retains all lease and certain other non crop income associated with the farms and the water used thereon 
the farm land and related personal property and other non water assets were acquired because the amount of water we will ultimately be permitted to develop for municipal purposes is based on the historical consumptive use of such water 
we anticipate that approximately  acre feet of the  acre feet we own will be available for non agricultural uses along the front range  but the arkansas river water will not be available for such purposes until we successfully file for a change of use in water court as described below 
by owning the land and having the water continue to be used for agricultural purposes  we continue to maintain beneficial use of the water 

table of contents in order to use this water for municipal purposes we must file a change of use application with the water court 
this will likely be a lengthy process and require a substantial amount of capital for legal and engineering services 
if we successfully change the use of our water rights to include municipal uses  we would then need to construct a pipeline and other infrastructure to transport the water to the municipal customers  which could cost in excess of million 
although we have not yet filed a change of use application 
we are working with the flcc and other interested parties in the arkansas river valley to mitigate any adverse impacts to the local communities and to make investments and decisions on farming operations which benefit continued agricultural operations as well as providing new municipal water supplies for the front range 
we are conducting a rotational crop study program and participating in discussions with area interests including the lower arkansas valley super ditch super ditch  which is a group of arkansas valley irrigators that have assembled to study alternatives to traditional buy and dry agricultural to municipal water transfers 
due to the renewable nature of surface water  owning this large portfolio of surface water allows us to more effectively market our water and wastewater services to customers in the denver metropolitan market as well as other markets such as the colorado springs region 
timing of the development of the arkansas river water will depend on the timing of new connections to our water and wastewater systems 
we plan to fund the development of the arkansas river water  much like the other water we own  by using proceeds generated from the sale of taps associated with new connections to our system 
in addition to increasing our service capacities  the arkansas river water may present additional market opportunities for us to assist other water providers in solving their long term water supply needs for their existing and new connections 
see also item a risk factors for additional information on the risks associated with a water transfer case and other risks associated with the arkansas river water 
arapahoe county fairgrounds agreement for water service in  we entered into an agreement for water service the county agreement with arapahoe county the county to design  construct  operate and maintain a water system for  and provide water services to  the arapahoe county fairgrounds the fairgrounds  which is located west of the lowry range 
pursuant to the county agreement we purchased acre feet of water in further details of the funding arrangements with the county are described in note to the accompanying financial statements 
pursuant to the county agreement we constructed various wholesale and special facilities  including a new deep water well  a foot tall   gallon water tank and pipelines to transport water to the fairgrounds 
the construction of the special and wholesale facilities were completed in our fiscal  and we began providing water service to the fairgrounds on july  sky ranch water supply and water service agreements the sky ranch property incorporates approximately acres located four miles north of the lowry range along interstate as described in item a risk factors below  the developer of sky ranch currently has a plan of liquidation pending in federal bankruptcy court 
we are party to two water service agreements the sky ranch agreements with the developer of sky ranch which  based on the approved preliminary development plans  obligate us to provide water service to the homes  businesses  schools and other customers at the development  which could include service to up to  sfes 
the sky ranch agreements also grant us the right to purchase a total of acre feet of water located beneath sky ranch as described in greater detail in note to the accompanying financial statements 
due to the pending bankruptcy proceeding  the timing of development at sky ranch  if any  and the status of the sky ranch agreements  is uncertain 
paradise water supply in we acquired the conditional rights to build a  acre foot reservoir to store colorado river tributary water and a right of way permit from the us bureau of land management for property at the dam and reservoir site collectively known as our paradise water supply 
due to the significant development costs of water assets along the western slope and agreements with other western slope water interests  the use of our paradise water supply is limited to opportunities along the western slope

table of contents well enhancement and recovery systems in january  we  along with two other parties each of whom own rd of the venture  formed well enhancement and recovery systems  llc well enhancement llc  to develop a new deep water well enhancement tool and process which we believe will increase the efficiency of wells into the denver basin groundwater formation 
in our fiscal  the well enhancement tool and process was completed and tested on two deep water wells developed by an area water provider with favorable results 
according to studies performed by an independent hydro geologist  preliminary results indicate the well enhancement tool effectively increased the production of the two test wells by approximately and when compared to that of nearby wells developed in similar formations at similar depths 
based on the positive results of the test wells  we continue to refine the process of enhancing deep water wells and anticipate marketing the tool to area water providers 
we did not utilize the well enhancement tool during due to a lack of wells being drilled in the denver metropolitan market 
during the fiscal years ended august   and  well enhancement llc expensed approximately   and  respectively  for research and development activities 
since we are a rd owner of well enhancement llc  we recorded approximately   and  respectively  of well enhancement llc s losses for the fiscal years ended august   and revenues we generate revenues predominately from three sources water and wastewater tap fees  construction fees  and monthly service fees 
we typically negotiate the payment terms for tap fees  construction fees  and other water and wastewater service fees with each developer  builder or municipality before we commit to providing service and before construction of the project commences 
water and wastewater tap fees tap fees are paid by the developer in advance of construction activities and are non refundable 
tap fees are typically used to fund construction of the wholesale facilities and defray the acquisition costs of obtaining water rights 
pursuant to our rangeview water agreements with the district and the land board  pricing for water tap fees as well as water usage charges described further below is controlled through a market driven pricing mechanism in which our rates and charges may not exceed the average of similar rates and charges of three nearby water providers 
due to increases in tap fees at these communities  effective july   water tap fees increased  to  per sfe  which is a increase over the water tap fee 
wastewater tap fees remained unchanged at  table a provides a summary of our water tap fees since table a water system tap fees water tap fees per sfe percentage increase tap fees revenues are deferred and recognized in the statement of operations as income as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies and use of estimates and note to the accompanying financial statements 
developers owning rights to either surface water or groundwater underlying their properties may receive a credit against a portion of their water tap fees if they elect to sell their water to us  which is negotiated at the time of the service agreement 

table of contents construction fees construction fees are fees we receive  typically in advance  from developers  for us to build certain infrastructure such as special facilities 
construction revenues are deferred and recognized in the statement of operations as income as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies and use of estimates and note to the accompanying financial statements 
monthly service fees monthly water usage charges are assessed to our customers based on actual metered usage each month 
water usage pricing uses a tiered pricing structure which is capped at the average of the prices charged by the same three surrounding water providers used as the basis for our water tap fees 
despite increases by these water providers  in we chose not to increase our monthly usage rates in order to provide more competitive usage charges in our service area  however  the tiered pricing structure has increased over the past several years as noted in table b below table b tiered water usage pricing structure price per thousand gallons amount of consumption base charge per sfe gallons to  gallons  gallons to  gallons  gallons and above water revenues are sensitive to timing and volume of water use  meaning the more water used by a customer in a given month  the higher the cost of additional incremental water deliveries to the customer 
based on this  for a typical residential customer using approximately acre feet of water annually  during a typical weather year  water usage fees total approximately per year 
wastewater customers are charged a flat monthly fee of per sfe  or per year per sfe  which was last increased on july  from per sfe  an increase of 
we also collect other immaterial fees and charges from residential customers and other end users to cover miscellaneous administrative and service expenses  such as application fees  review fees and permit fees 
land board royalties and district fees pursuant to the rangeview water agreements  the land board is entitled to royalty payments based on a percentage of revenues earned from water sales that utilize water from the lowry range or export water 
the calculation of royalties depends on whether the customer is located on the lowry range or elsewhere  and whether the customer is a public or private entity 
in addition  the district is entitled to retain of amounts collected with respect to water sales to customers located on the lowry range  after deducting the royalty payment to the land board 
pursuant to the wastewater agreement  the district is entitled to of our wastewater service charge revenue not including wastewater tap fees from customers on the lowry range 
the land board does not receive a royalty from wastewater services 
lowry range customers for services to customers located on the lowry range  the district collects fees from customers  pays the royalties to the land board  retains its own fee  and remits the remainder to us 
water service related payments from customers on the lowry range generate royalties to the land board at a rate of of gross revenues 
when either i metered production of water used on the lowry range in any calendar year exceeds  acre feet or ii  surface acres on the lowry range have been rezoned to non agricultural use  finally platted and water tap agreements have been entered into with respect to all improvements to be constructed on such acreage  the land board may elect  at its option  to receive  in lieu of its royalty of of gross revenues  of the net profits derived by the district and pure cycle after the land board s election from the sale or other disposition of water on the lowry range 
to date neither of these conditions has been met and such conditions are not likely to be met any time soon 

table of contents export water customers payments for export water also generate royalty payments to the land board 
these royalties vary depending on a number of factors 
when we withdraw  treat and deliver water to customers located off the lowry range  incurring the costs related to this process  royalties to the land board are based on our net revenues  which are defined as gross revenues less costs  including reasonable overhead allocations  incurred as a direct and indirect result of incremental activity associated with the withdrawal  treatment and delivery of the water 
royalties payable to the land board for export water sales escalate based on the amount of net revenue we receive and are lower for sales to a water district or similar municipal or public entity than for sales to a private entity as noted in table c table c royalties for export water sales royalty rate private public net revenues entity entity over  our current operations we designed  built and operate water and wastewater systems that serve customers both on the lowry range as well as customers off the lowry range including the arapahoe county fairgrounds 
during fiscal we delivered approximately million gallons of potable water to our customers 
on average  this equates to approximately  gallons per month during the winter and over six million gallons per month during the summer 
our wastewater treatment facility has a permitted capacity of  gallons per day and currently receives about  gallons per day 
we operate and maintain all of our water and wastewater facilities with limited assistance from third party contractors 
we designed  constructed and operate the facilities serving customers on the lowry range and plan to operate this system  together with facilities serving customers in areas outside the lowry range  in an integrated manner to capitalize on economies of scale and ensure the most efficient use of our water 
currently we provide service to approximately single family equivalent water connections and single family wastewater connections both on and off the lowry range 
significant customers table d lists the customers which accounted for of more of our revenues for the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
table d significant customers of water usage fees ridgeview youth services center schmidt aggregates combined of wastewater service fees ridgeview youth services center 
table of contents our projected operations this section should be read in conjunction with item a risk factors 
we design  construct and operate our existing and future water and wastewater facilities using advanced water purification and wastewater treatment technologies which allow us to use our water supplies in an efficient and environmentally friendly manner 
we plan to develop our water and wastewater systems in stages to efficiently meet increasing demands in our service areas  thereby reducing the amount of up front capital costs required for construction 
we use third party contractors to construct our facilities as needed 
we employ licensed water and wastewater operators to operate our water and wastewater systems 
as our systems expand  we expect to hire additional personnel to operate our systems  read meters  bill customers  and manage our operations 
we plan to take advantage of advanced technologies  such as systems that enable meter readings and billings to be done remotely  to keep labor and other operating costs low 
our water and wastewater systems conjunctively use surface and groundwater supplies and storage of raw water and highly treated effluent supplies to provide a balanced sustainable water supply for our customers 
integrating conservation efforts with effective water reuse makes our water and wastewater systems environmentally responsible 
our denver based supplies are a valuable  locally available  resource located near the point of use 
this enables us to incrementally develop infrastructure to produce  treat and deliver water to customers based on their growing demands 
adding our locally available supplies to our intermediate and longer term supplies from the arkansas river balances both current and ongoing supplies to meet the growing water demands in the front range market 
our arkansas river supplies are located in southeast colorado and will require an approximately mile pipeline and water treatment and pumping facilities with an estimated cost of over million to deliver the water to front range customers 
we are currently investigating various pipeline alignments and potential partnerships for construction of these facilities 
we are also in discussion with the arkansas valley super ditch which is studying the feasibility of developing a system wide mechanism to transfer water from the arkansas river basin to water short regions through a rotational crop fallowing program 
converting the arkansas water to municipal use and constructing a delivery system will be a long term process  but one which will allow us to work closely with those who might benefit or otherwise be impacted by any water transfers 
the development of this water will require us to apply for a change of use application in the water court which is anticipated to take from one to more than three years and require a significant capital investment 
however  we do not plan on starting this process in the near term and anticipate that the tap fees and usage fees from taps sold utilizing our rangeview water supply  along with funding from other pipeline partners  will be sufficient to fund the water delivery facilities 
based on our initial development plans  we expect the development of our rangeview water supply to require a significant number of high capacity deep water wells 
we anticipate drilling separate wells into each of the three principal aquifers located beneath the lowry range 
each well is intended to deliver water to central water treatment facilities for treatment prior to delivery to customers 
development of our lowry range surface water supplies will require facilities to divert surface water to storage reservoirs to be located on the lowry range and treatment facilities to treat the water prior to introduction into our distribution systems 
surface water diversion facilities will be designed with capacities to divert the surface water when available particularly during seasonal events such as spring run off and summer storms 
based on preliminary engineering estimates  the full build out of water facilities including diversion structures  transmission pipelines  reservoirs  and water treatment facilities on the lowry range will cost in excess of million and will accommodate water service to customers located in and outside the lowry range 
rangeview metropolitan district the district is a quasi municipal corporation and political subdivision of colorado formed in for the purpose of providing water and wastewater service to the lowry range 
the district is required to utilize the  acre feet of water leased to it by the land board to serve customers on the lowry range 
the district is run by an elected board of directors 
the only eligible voters and the only persons eligible to serve as directors are the owners of property within the boundaries of the district 
we own certain rights to the real property which encompasses the current boundaries of the district 
the current directors of the district are mark w 
harding and scott e 
lehman both employees of pure cycle  and an independent board member 

table of contents we are party to a right of first refusal agreement with the owners of the property comprising the district 
pursuant to a tenancy in common agreement  in the event of death  bankruptcy or incompetence of any tenant  that tenant s estate or representative must offer the property interest of that tenant to the remaining tenants for purchase 
if the remaining tenants do not purchase all of such person s interest  the property must be offered to us pursuant to the right of first refusal agreement 
in addition  if any tenant wants to sell his interest in the parcel  such tenant must find a bona fide buyer and then offer the property to us 
we have the right  at our option  to buy the property by matching the terms of the bona fide third party offer or by paying the appraised value of the property as determined by independent appraisers 
a tenant may also negotiate a sale directly with us if he elects not to locate a bona fide buyer 
each of the directors listed above currently owns an undivided interest in the land comprising the district 
under applicable colorado law  entities are not qualified to serve as directors of municipal districts and may not vote 
our president and corporate secretary serve as elected members of the board of directors of the district 
pursuant to colorado law  directors receive for each board meeting or a maximum of  per year 
we and the district s board of directors transact business on an arms length basis 
potential conflicts of interest of the directors in transactions between us and the district are disclosed in filings with the colorado secretary of state 
the district and we were each represented by separate legal counsel in negotiating the rangeview water agreements and those agreements were approved by the independent members of the district s board and by the land board at the time they were entered into 
it is likely that at some point in the future  the district s board of directors will be comprised entirely of independent directors 
as the land board develops the lowry range  landowners on the lowry range may petition to include their land within the district s boundaries 
provided such petition complies with applicable law  the district is required by the rangeview water service agreements to proceed with due diligence to include the area designated in such petition within the district s boundaries 
as the district s boundaries expand  the base of persons eligible to serve as directors and eligible to vote will also increase 
water and growth in colorado in  the colorado economy  much like that of the us as a whole  has experienced a continuing recession 
housing starts fell nearly over the prior year and the unemployment rates rose to in august  as compared to in august despite this  the denver regional council of governments drcog  a voluntary association of over county and municipal governments in the denver metropolitan area  estimates that the denver metropolitan area population will increase by about from today s million people to million people by the year a recent statewide water supply initiative report by the colorado water conservation board estimates that the south platte river basin  which includes the denver metropolitan region  will grow from a current population of approximately million to approximately million by the year  while the state populations increases from million to million 
accordingly  approximately of the projected state population increase is anticipated to occur within the south platte river basin 
significant increases in colorado s population  particularly in the denver metro region and other areas in the water short south platte river basin  together with increasing agricultural  recreational  and environmental water demands will intensify competition for water supplies 
estimated population increases brings increased demand for water services  exceeding what municipal service providers are currently capable of providing especially during drought conditions 
the statewide water supply initiative estimates that population growth in the denver region and the south platte river basin will result in additional water supply needs of over  acre feet by the year  which must be met with new water sources 
many cities and municipalities require property developers to demonstrate they have sufficient water supplies for their proposed projects before considering rezoning or annexation applications 
based on this  we focus our water marketing activities to developers and homebuilders that are active along the colorado front range as well as other area water providers in need of additional supplies 
colorado s future water supply needs will be met through conservation  reuse and the development of new supplies 
our rules and regulations for water and wastewater service call for adherence to strict conservation measures  including low flow water fixtures  high efficiency appliances  and advanced irrigation control devices 
additionally  our systems are designed and constructed using a dual pipe water distribution system that has one pipe to supply customers with high quality potable drinking water and a second pipe to supply raw or reclaimed water for irrigation 
typically  about one half of the water needed to meet denver area residential water demands is used for lawn and outdoor landscape irrigation 
along with most major water providers  we believe that raw or reclaimed water supplies provide the lowest cost water for irrigation 
our systems will include an extensive water reclamation system  in which essentially all effluent water from wastewater treatment plants will be reused to meet non potable water demands 
this will enhance our ability to provide quality water service and reinforce the importance of water reuse and our commitment to environmentally responsible water management policies 

table of contents competition we negotiate individual service agreements with developers and or homebuilders  cities and municipalities to design  construct and operate water and wastewater systems and to provide services 
these service agreements address all aspects of the development of the water and wastewater systems including i the purchase of water and wastewater taps in exchange for our obligation to construct the wholesale facilities  ii the establishment of payment terms  timing  capacity and location of special facilities if any  and iii specific terms related to our provision of ongoing water and wastewater services 
although we have exclusive long term water and wastewater service contracts for the majority of the lowry range we currently have the exclusive rights to serve two of the six development sections currently proposed at the lowry range  providing water service using our export water and arkansas river water is subject to competition 
moreover  competitors have attempted to challenge our exclusive rights to service the lowry range 
see item a risk factors lowry range below 
alternate sources of water are available  principally from other private parties  such as farmers or others owning senior water rights that have historically been used for agriculture  and from municipalities seeking to annex new development areas in order to increase their tax base 
our principal competition in areas close to the lowry range is the city of aurora  which has the ability to offer potential purchasers incentives  such as annexation and tax credits  which we cannot 
the other principal factors affecting competition for potential purchasers of our arkansas river water and export water include the availability of water for the particular purpose  the cost of delivering the water to the desired location and the reliability of the water supply during drought periods 
we believe the water assets we own and have the exclusive right to use  which have a supply capacity of approximately  sfe units  provide us a significant competitive advantage along the front range 
our legal rights to the rangeview water supply have been confirmed for municipal use and a significant portion of our water supply is close to denver area water users 
our pricing structure is competitive and our water portfolio is well balanced with senior surface water rights  groundwater rights  storage capacity and reclaimed water supplies

item a risk factors our business  operations  and financial condition are subject to significant risks 
these risks include those listed below and may include additional risks of which we are not currently aware or which we currently do not believe are material 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs  our business could be materially adversely affected 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
we are dependent on the development of the lowry range  sky ranch  and other areas near our rangeview water supply that are potential markets for our rangeview water supply 
providing water service using our rangeview water supply is one of our principal sources of future revenue 
the timing and amount of these revenues will depend significantly on the development of the lowry range  sky ranch and other potential developments near our rangeview water supply and along the colorado front range 
the development of these areas is not within our control 

table of contents lowry range as noted in item business  in june  the land board entered into an agreement with a developer for the sole development rights of six sections or approximately  acres of the lowry range 
of this  approximately two sections or approximately  acres were subject to our service rights under the lease 
in january  the developer withdrew from the development agreement 
the land board continues to own the property  however  we are not aware of any other projects planned by the land board and it may be some time before the land board commences another project 
even if the land board does proceed with another development plan  there can be no assurance that development will occur or that water sales will occur on acceptable terms or in the amounts or time required for us to support our costs of operation 
additionally  certain of our rights on the lowry range have been challenged 
on june   the colorado supreme court upheld the decision of the water court requiring the city of aurora to remove certain reservoir sites from its water court applications because the reservoir sites were already adjudicated to us pursuant to agreements with the land board 
while aurora has been unsuccessful so far in obtaining rights to the adjudicated reservoirs under the lease  additional legal action may become necessary to enforce our rights to the reservoirs and to provide water and wastewater service to the lowry range 
if additional legal proceedings become necessary and our rights under the lease are adversely ruled upon in such legal proceedings  it could materially adversely impact the value of our interests  including the value of our rangeview water supply 
our surface water interests and reservoirs sites at the lowry range are conditional decrees and are subject to a finding of reasonable diligence from the water court every six years 
to arrive at that finding  the water court must determine that we  together with the land board  continue to diligently pursue the development of the water rights 
if the water court is unable to make such a finding  these portions of the lowry range water supply could be lost 
the lowry range conditional decrees are currently under their first review by the water court to determine if such decrees meet the diligence criteria 
if the water court does not make a determination of reasonable diligence  it would materially adversely impact the value of our interests in the rangeview water supply 
because of the prior use of the lowry range as a military facility  environmental clean up may be required prior to development  including the removal of unexploded ordnance 
there is often significant delay in adoption of development plans  as the political process involves many constituencies with differing interests 
in the event water sales are not forthcoming or development of the lowry range is delayed indefinitely  we would need to incur additional short or long term debt obligations or seek to sell additional equity to generate operating capital  and there are no assurances that we would be successful in obtaining additional operating capital 
in addition  the land board may not develop large portions of the lowry range significantly limiting our ability to utilize the non export water specifically reserved for use on the lowry range 
sky ranch the developer of sky ranch has filed a plan of liquidation in bankruptcy court  which remains pending 
there has been no resolution of our claims against the developer of sky ranch and we do not know how the liquidation will impact our agreements with sky ranch or the sky ranch property 
the sky ranch agreements could be rejected in the bankruptcy proceeding leaving us with unsecured damage claims which would likely have little or no value 
in addition to our claims against the developer  a bank holds a security interest in the entire sky ranch development  including our agreements 
we are not aware of the bank s intentions with respect to its rights in the development 
until these issues are resolved  there will be no development and consequently no sales of water taps or water at sky ranch 
we cannot reasonably predict how long this process will take or whether any of our rights related to sky ranch will have any value following the liquidation of the sky ranch developer 
the colorado housing market and economic conditions could adversely affect our operations 
our operations are affected by general economic conditions and the pace and location of real estate development activities in the greater denver metropolitan area  most particularly areas which are close to our rangeview water supply 
since  the colorado housing market has seen significant declines in new construction  which could continue for some time 
the current instability in the credit markets has exacerbated the decline in demand for new homes 
new connections to our water and wastewater systems depend on real estate development in our service areas 
we have no ability to control the pace and location of real estate development activities which affect our business 
if the downturn in the homebuilding and credit markets continues  intensifies  or if the national economy weakens further and economic concerns intensify  it could have a significant negative impact on our business 

table of contents we are involved in on going discussion with the land board to clarify our rights and obligations with respect to our rangeview water supply and such negotiations may not be successful 
our rangeview water supply rights derive principally from the lease between the land board and the district which was entered into in prior to any development of the lowry range or of areas outside the lowry range that utilize our export water 
the terms of the lease did not fully anticipate the specific circumstances of development that have arisen and may not clearly delineate rights and responsibilities for the forms of transactions that may arise in the future 
we are involved in ongoing discussions with the land board to clarify the terms of the lease 
an unfavorable outcome in such discussion could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
in order to utilize the arkansas river water acquired in fiscal  we must apply for a change of use with the water court and this may take several years to complete 
the change of use of our arkansas river water requires a favorable ruling by the water court  which could take several years and be a costly and contentious effort since it is anticipated that many parties will oppose the change of use and the transfer of the water 
there are several conditions which must be satisfied prior to our receiving a change of use decree for transfer of our arkansas river water 
one condition that we must satisfy is a showing of anti speculation in which we  as the applicant  must demonstrate that we have contractual obligations to provide water service to customers prior to the water court ruling on the transfer of a water right 
the water court is also expected to limit the transfer to the consumptive use portion of the water right and to address changing the historic use of the water from agricultural uses to other uses such as municipal and industrial use 
we expect to face opposition to any consumptive use calculations of the historic agricultural uses of this water 
the water court may impose conditions on our transfer of the water rights such as requiring us to mitigate the loss of the farming tax base  imposing re vegetation requirements to convert soils from irrigated to non irrigated  and imposing water quality measures 
any such conditions will likely increase the cost of transferring the water rights 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to develop our water rights  in particular the arkansas river water 
development of water rights requires a substantial capital investment 
we anticipate financing water and wastewater systems primarily through the sale of water taps and water delivery charges to users 
however  we cannot assure you that these sources of cash will be sufficient to cover our capital costs 
moreover  the development of the arkansas river water will require a pipeline and other infrastructure to deliver the water to the front range  which is anticipated to cost over million 
we likely would be required to partner with others to finance a project of this magnitude and there is no assurance we would be able to obtain the financing necessary to develop our arkansas river water 
our valuation of the tap participation fee payable to hp a m contains estimates and management assumptions 
the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
as part of our acquisition of the arkansas river water rights from hp a m  we granted hp a m a tap participation fee entitling hp a m to receive ten percent of the gross proceeds of our sales of forty thousand  water taps the tap participation fee 
for accounting purposes we have estimated the fair value of the tap participation fee payable to hp a m using available historic market information and estimated future market data and projections 
we believe the estimates we used reasonably reflect the fair value of the tap participation fee 
accounting estimates involve matters of uncertainty and judgment and interpreting relevant market data is inherently subjective in nature 
many factors are necessary to estimate future market conditions  including but not limited to  supply and demand for new homes  population growth along the front range  tap fee increases at our rate base districts  and other market forces beyond our control 
the actual results could differ materially from the accounting estimates reflected in our balance sheet which would result in significant changes to the fees being paid to hp a m and to the imputed interest being reflected on our future statements of operations associated with the tap participation fee 
in the event of default by hp a m on any of the promissory notes secured by deeds of trust on our properties  we would be required to cure the defaults or lose the properties 
certain of the real properties we acquired from hp a m are subject to promissory notes  aggregating approximately million in principal and interest as of august  the notes are secured by deeds of trust on the properties we own  but are solely the responsibility of hp a m 
because of hp a m s financial position and the substantial penalties imposed on hp a m in the event of a default  the likelihood of hp a m defaulting on the notes is deemed remote 
as a result the promissory notes are not reflected on our balance sheet 
however  if hp a m was to default on any of the notes  and the defaults were not cured  we would lose up to approximately of the real properties we acquired which equates to approximately of our arkansas river water rights 

table of contents our net losses may continue and we may not have sufficient liquidity to pursue our business objectives 
we have experienced significant net losses and could continue to incur net losses 
for the fiscal years ended august   and  we had net losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  on revenues of approximately   and  in the respective periods 
our cash flows from operations have not been sufficient to fund our operations in the past  and we have been required to raise debt and equity capital to remain in operation 
since  we have raised approximately million through the issuance of common stock to support our operations 
our ability to fund our operational needs and meet our business objectives will depend on our ability to generate cash from future operations 
if our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are not sufficient to fund our operations and the significant capital expenditure requirements to build our water delivery systems  we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities  or seek to obtain additional debt or equity capital  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
the rates we are allowed to charge customers on the lowry range are limited by the lease with the land board and our contract with the district and may not be sufficient to cover our costs of construction and operation 
the prices we can charge for our water and wastewater services on the lowry range are subject to pricing regulations set in the lease with the land board 
both the tap fees and our usage rates and charges are capped at the average of the rates of three surrounding water providers 
annually we survey the tap fees and rates of the surrounding providers and we typically adjust our tap fees and rates and charges based on the average of those charged by this group 
our costs associated with the construction of water delivery systems and the production  treatment and delivery of our water are subject to market conditions and other factors  which may increase at a significantly greater rate than the prices charged by the three surrounding providers 
factors beyond our control and which cannot be predicted  such as drought  water contamination and severe weather conditions  like tornadoes and floods  may result in additional labor and material costs that may not be recoverable under our rate structure 
either increased customer demand or increased water conservation may also impact the overall cost of our operations 
if the costs for construction and operation of our water services  including the cost of extracting our groundwater  exceed our revenues  we would be providing service to the lowry range at a loss 
we may petition the land board for rate increases  however  there can be no assurance that the land board would approve a rate increase request 
we have three full time employees and may not be able to manage the increasing demands of our expanding operations 
we currently have three employees to administer our existing assets  interface with applicable governmental bodies  market our services and plan for the construction and development of our future assets 
we may not be able to maximize the value of our water assets because of our limited manpower 
we depend significantly on the services of mark w 
harding  our president 
the loss of mr 
harding would cause a significant interruption of our operations 
the success of our future business development and ability to capitalize on growth opportunities depends on our ability to attract and retain additional experienced and qualified persons to operate and manage our business 
state regulations set the training  experience and qualification standards required for our employees to operate specific water and wastewater facilities 
failure to find state certified and qualified employees to support the operation of our facilities could put us at risk  among other things  for operational errors at the facilities  for improper billing and collection processes  and for loss of contracts and revenues 
we cannot assure you that we can successfully manage our assets and our growth 
we may be adversely affected by any future decision by the colorado public utilities commission to regulate us as a public utility 
the colorado public utilities commission cpuc regulates investor owned water companies operating for the purpose of supplying water to the public 
the cpuc regulates many aspects of public utilities operations  including establishing water rates and fees  initiating inspections  enforcement and compliance activities and assisting consumers with complaints 
we do not believe we are a public utility under colorado law 
we currently provide services by contract to the district  which supplies the public 
quasi municipal metropolitan districts  such as the district  are exempt by statute from regulation by the cpuc 
however  the cpuc could attempt to regulate us as a public utility 
if this were to occur  we might incur significant expense challenging the cpuc s assertion of jurisdiction  and we may be unsuccessful 
in the future  existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities 
if we become regulated as a public utility  our ability to generate profits could be limited and we might incur significant costs associated with regulatory compliance 

table of contents there are many obstacles to our ability to sell our paradise water supply 
we currently earn no revenues from our paradise water supply  which as of august  has a recorded cost of approximately million 
our ability to convert our paradise water supply into an income generating asset is limited 
due to the cost of developing western slope water and agreements with other western slope water interests  our use of the paradise water supply is limited to opportunities along the western slope 
as part of our water court decree for the paradise water supply  we are permitted to construct a storage facility on the colorado river 
however  due to a stipulation entered into with various objectors to our paradise water rights and the strict regulatory requirements for constructing a reservoir on the main stem of the colorado river  we do not anticipate completing the storage facility at its decreed location 
we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to make use of this asset or sell the water profitably 
our paradise water supply is also conditioned on a finding of reasonable diligence from the water court every six years 
to arrive at that finding  the water court must determine that we continue to diligently pursue the development of the water rights 
if the water court is unable to make such a finding  our right to the paradise water supply would be lost and we would be required to impair the paradise water supply asset and incur a million charge against earnings 
the fiscal review was completed in but not without objectors and not without us having to agree to certain stipulations to remove the objections 
in order to continue to maintain the paradise water right  over the next six years we must i select an alternative reservoir site  ii file an application in water court to change the place of storage  iii identify specific end users and place s of use of the water  and iv identify specific source s of the water rights for use 
conflicts of interest may arise relating to the operation of the district 
our officers and employees constitute a majority of the directors of the district 
pure cycle  along with our officers and employees and one unrelated individual  own  as tenants in common  the acres that form the district 
we have made loans to the district to fund its operations 
at august   total principal and interest owed to us by the district was approximately  the district is a party to our agreements with the land board and receives fees of of the revenues from the sale of water on the lowry range 
proceeds from the fee collections will initially be used to repay the district s obligations to us  but after these loans are repaid  the district is not required to use the funds to benefit pure cycle 
we have received benefits from our activities undertaken in conjunction with the district  but conflicts may arise between our interests and those of the district  and with our officers who are acting in dual capacities in negotiating contracts to which both we and the district are parties 
we expect that the district will expand when more properties are developed and become part of the district  and our officers acting as directors of the district will have fiduciary obligations to those other constituents 
there can be no assurance that all conflicts will be resolved in the best interests of pure cycle and its shareholders 
in addition  other landowners coming into the district will be eligible to vote and to serve as directors of the district 
there can be no assurances that our officers and employees will remain as directors of the district or that the actions of a subsequently elected board would not have an adverse impact on our operations 
we are required to maintain stringent water quality standards and are subject to regulatory and environmental risks 
we must provide water that meets all federal and state regulatory water quality standards and operate our water and wastewater facilities in accordance with these standards 
we face contamination and pollution issues regarding our water supplies 
improved detection technology  increasingly stringent regulatory requirements  and heightened consumer awareness of water quality issues contribute to an environment of increased focus on water quality 
we cannot assure you that in the future we will be able to reduce the amounts of contaminants in our water to acceptable levels 
in addition  the standards that we must meet are constantly changing and becoming more stringent 
future changes in regulations governing the supply of drinking water and treatment of wastewater may have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
in october  the water quality control division of the colorado department of public health and environment advised us of proposed changes to the discharge permit for the district s coal creek wastewater reclamation facility 
the revised permit requires compliance with effluent ammonia limitations  use of e 
coli rather than fecal coliform as an indicator of effluent disinfection efficacy  and a more stringent lower effluent chlorine residual limitation 
the revised permit establishes a schedule for complying with the new criteria and although we do not anticipate having significant difficulties complying with the revised permit  future requirements may be more costly and difficult 

table of contents our water supplies are subject to contamination  including contamination from naturally occurring compounds  pollution from man made sources and intentional sabotage 
in addition  we handle certain hazardous materials at our water treatment facilities  primarily sodium hypochlorite 
any failure of our operation of the facilities or any contamination of our supplies in the future  including sewage spills  noncompliance with water quality standards  hazardous materials leaks and spills  and similar events could expose us to environmental liabilities  claims and litigation costs 
if any of these events occur  we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the supply from another source or treat the contaminated supply 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully manage these issues  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
we might not be able to recover the costs associated with these liabilities through our rates and charges or insurance or such recovery may not occur in a timely manner 
our contracts for the construction of water and wastewater projects may expose us to certain completion and performance risks 
we intend to rely on independent contractors to construct our water and wastewater facilities 
these construction activities may involve risks  including shortages of materials and labor  work stoppages  labor relations disputes  weather interference  engineering  environmental  permitting or geological problems and unanticipated cost increases 
these issues could give rise to delays  cost overruns or performance deficiencies  or otherwise adversely affect the construction or operation of our water and wastewater delivery systems 
in addition  we may experience quality problems in the construction of our systems and facilities  including equipment failures 
we cannot assure you that we will not face claims from customers or others regarding product quality and installation of equipment placed in service by contractors 
certain of our contracts may be fixed price contracts  in which we may bear all or a significant portion of the risk for cost overruns 
under these fixed price contracts  contract prices are established in part based on fixed  firm subcontractor quotes on contracts and on cost and scheduling estimates 
these estimates may be based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials  and other issues 
if these subcontractor quotations or cost estimates prove inaccurate  or if circumstances change  cost overruns may occur  and our financial results would be negatively impacted 
in many cases  the incurrence of these additional costs would not be within our control 
we may have contracts in which we guarantee project completion by a scheduled date 
at times  we may guarantee that the project  when completed  will achieve certain performance standards 
if we fail to complete the project as scheduled  or if we fail to meet guaranteed performance standards  we may be held responsible for cost impacts and or penalties to the customer resulting from any delay or for the costs to alter the project to achieve the performance standards 
to the extent that these events occur and are not due to circumstances for which the customer accepts responsibility or cannot be mitigated by performance bonds or the provisions of our agreements with contractors  the total costs of the project would exceed our original estimates and our financial results would be negatively impacted 
our customers may require us to secure performance and completion bonds for certain contracts and projects 
the market environment for surety companies has become more risk averse 
we secure performance and completion bonds for our contracts from these surety companies 
to the extent we are unable to obtain bonds  we may not be awarded new contracts 
we cannot assure you that we can secure performance and completion bonds when required 
we may operate engineering and construction activities for water and wastewater facilities where design  construction or system failures could result in injury to third parties or damage to property 
any losses that exceed claims against our contractors  the performance bonds and our insurance limits at such facilities could result in claims against us 
in addition  if there is a customer dispute regarding performance of our services  the customer may decide to delay or withhold payment to us 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations  which could affect demand for our water service and our revenues 
demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with cooling systems  irrigation systems and other outside water use 
throughout the year  and particularly during typically warmer months  demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels 
if temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than expected or there is more rainfall than expected  the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 

table of contents weather conditions and overuse may interfere with our sources of water  demand for water services  and our ability to supply water to our customers 
we depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers and to continue our expansion efforts 
conditions beyond our control may interfere with our water supply sources 
drought and overuse may limit the availability of water 
these factors might adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and our revenues and earnings may be adversely affected 
additionally  cool and wet weather  as well as drought restrictions and our customers conservation efforts  may reduce consumption demands  also adversely affecting our revenue and earnings 
furthermore  freezing weather may also contribute to water transmission interruptions caused by pipe and main breakage 
if we experience an interruption in our water supply  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
item b unresolved staff comments we have no unresolved staff comments

our md a section includes the following items our business a general description of our business  our services and our business strategy 
critical accounting policies and estimates a discussion of our critical accounting policies that require critical judgments  assumptions and estimates 
results of operations analysis of our results of operations for the three fiscal years presented in our financial statements 
we present our discussion in the md a in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
liquidity  capital resources and financial position an analysis of our cash position and cash flows  as well as a discussion of our financing arrangements 
our business we are a water and wastewater service provider 
we contract with land owners  land developers  home builders  cities  and municipalities to design  construct  operate and maintain water and wastewater systems using our balanced water portfolio consisting of surface water and groundwater supplies  surface water storage  aquifer storage  and reclaimed water supplies 
we generate cash flows and revenues by i selling taps connections to our water and wastewater systems and or ii monthly service fees and consumption charges from metered deliveries 
tap fee connection charges are a one time fee typically paid by developers which are used to recoup the cost of the company s water rights and for construction of the various facilities required to withdraw  store  treat and deliver water to customers and reclaim  store  treat and deliver treated effluent water to satisfy irrigation demands 
monthly service fees and consumption charges from metered deliveries of water and flat monthly fees for wastewater are paid by customers homeowners  business owners or consumers of water and wastewater services 
monthly service fees include i base monthly fees  ii monthly metered water usage fees both potable and irrigation uses which are charged at different rates  and iii other service related fees 
we currently provide water service to approximately single family equivalent water connections and approximately single family equivalent wastewater connections 
during the fiscal years ended august   and  we did not sell any water or wastewater taps 
during the fiscal years ended august   and  we received approximately   and  from the sale of water  respectively  and we received approximately   and  from monthly wastewater service fees  respectively 
currently all monthly water and wastewater fees are generated utilizing our rangeview water supply 
see critical accounting policies and use of estimates below regarding our revenue recognition policies 

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the timing of revenue recognition  the impairment analysis of our water rights  management s valuation of the tap participation fee  and share based compensation 
below is a summary of these critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenues consist mainly of tap fees and monthly service fees 
as further described in note to the accompanying financial statements  proceeds from tap sales are deferred upon receipt and recognized in income based on whether we own or do not own the facilities constructed with the proceeds 
we recognize tap fees derived from agreements for which we construct infrastructure the customer will own as revenue  along with the associated costs of construction  pursuant to the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method requires management to estimate the percent of work that is completed on a particular project  which could change materially throughout the duration of the construction period and result in significant fluctuations in revenue recognized during the reporting periods throughout the construction process 
we did not recognize any revenues pursuant to the percentage of completion method during the fiscal years ended august   or tap fees derived from agreements for which we own the infrastructure are recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated service life of the assets constructed with said fees 
although the cash will be received up front and most construction will be completed within one year of receipt of the proceeds  revenue recognition may occur over years or more 
management is required to estimate the service life  and currently the service life is based on the estimated useful accounting life of the assets constructed with the tap fees 
the useful accounting life of the asset is based on management s estimation of an accounting based useful life and may not have any correlation to the actual life of the asset or the actual service life of the tap 
this is deemed a reasonable recognition life of the revenues because the depreciation of the assets constructed generating those revenues will be matched with the revenues 
impairment of water assets and other long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever management believes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows we expect to be generated by the eventual use of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired and therefore the costs of the assets deemed to be unrecoverable  the impairment to be recognized would be the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
our water assets will be utilized in the provision of water services which inevitably will encompass many housing and economic cycles 
our service capacities are quantitatively estimated based on an average single family home utilizing 
acre feet of water per year 
our water supplies are legally decreed to us through the water court 
the water court decree allocates a specific amount of water subject to continued beneficial use which historically has not changed 
thus  individual housing and economic cycles typically do not have an impact on the number of connections we can serve or the amount of water legally decreed to us 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

table of contents our front range and arkansas river water rights we determine the undiscounted cash flows for our denver based assets and the arkansas river valley assets by estimating tap sales to potential new developments in our service area and along the front range  using estimated future tap fees less estimated costs to provide water services  over an estimated development period 
actual new home development in our service area and the front range  actual future tap fees  and actual future operating costs  inevitably will vary significantly from our estimates  which could have a material impact on our financial statements as well as our results of operations 
we performed an impairment analysis as of august   and determined that our rangeview and arkansas river water assets were not impaired and their costs were deemed recoverable 
our impairment analysis is based on development occurring within areas in which we have service agreements eg sky ranch and the lowry range as well as in surrounding areas including the front range  and the i corridor 
we estimate that we have the ability to provide water services to approximately  sfe s using our combined front range and arkansas river water assets which have a carrying value of approximately million as of august  based on the carrying value of our water rights  the long term and uncertain nature of any development plans  current tap fees of  and estimated gross margins  we estimate that we would need to add approximately  new water connections requiring approximately of our portfolio to generate net revenues sufficient to recover the costs of our front range and arkansas river water assets 
if tap fees increase  we would need to add approximately  new water taps requiring approximately of our portfolio to recover the costs of our front range and arkansas river water assets 
if tap fees decrease  we would need to add approximately  new water taps requiring approximately of our portfolio to recover the costs of our front range and arkansas river water assets 
although the withdrawal of the lowry range developer  the sky ranch bankruptcy filing  and changes in the housing market throughout the front range have delayed our estimated tap sale projections  they do not alter our water ownership  nor our service obligation to these properties or the number of sfe s we can service 
our paradise water rights every six years the paradise water supply is subject to a finding of reasonable diligence review by the water court and the state engineer 
for a favorable finding  the water court must determine that we continue to diligently pursue the development of the water rights 
if the water court does not make such a finding  our right to the paradise water supply would be lost and we would be required to impair the paradise water supply asset 
the most recent diligence review was started in our fiscal and was completed in  but not without objectors and not without us having to agree to certain stipulations to remove the objections 
in order to continue to maintain the paradise water right  over the next six years we must i select an alternative reservoir site  ii file an application in water court to change the place of storage  iii identify specific end users and place s of use of the water  and iv identify specific source s of the water rights for use 
we fully intend to meet the stipulations by the date of the next diligence review 
for our paradise water supply  we determined the undiscounted cash flows by estimating the proceeds we could derive from the leasing of the water rights to commercial  industrial  and agricultural users along the western slope of colorado  and based on the impairment analysis we completed at august   we believe the paradise water supply is not impaired and the costs are deemed recoverable 
tap participation fee on august   we acquired  acre feet of arkansas river water along with approximately  acres of real property and other associated rights from hp a m 
along with common stock issued to hp a m  we agreed to pay hp a m this may increase to under circumstances described in note to the accompanying financial statements of our tap fees on the sale of the next  water taps we sell from and after the date of the arkansas river agreement  of which  water taps remain to be paid as of august  the tap participation fee is payable when we sell water taps and receive funds from such water tap sales or other dispositions of property purchased in the hp a m acquisition 
the tap participation fee liability is valued by estimating new home development in our service area over an estimated development period 
this was done by utilizing third party historical and projected housing and population growth data for the denver metropolitan area applied to an estimated development pattern supported by historical development patterns of certain master planned communities in the denver metropolitan area 
this development pattern was then applied to estimated future water tap fees determined by using historical water tap fee trends 
based on updated new home activity in the denver metropolitan area  we updated the estimated discounted cash flow analysis as of february  due to a lack of significant changes  no such update was deemed necessary as of august  actual new home development in our service area and actual future tap fees inevitably will vary significantly from our estimates which could have a material impact on our financial statements as well as our results of operations 
an important component in our estimate of the value of the tap participation fee  which is based on historical trends  is that we reasonably expect water tap fees to continue to increase in the coming years 
tap fees are a market based pricing metric which in part demonstrates the increasing costs to acquire and develop new water supplies 
it is thus a market metric which in part demonstrates the increasing value of our water assets 
we continue to assess the value of the tap participation fee liability and update its valuation analysis whenever events or circumstances indicate the assumptions used to estimate the value of the liability have changed materially 
the difference between the net present value and the estimated realizable value will be imputed as interest expense using the effective interest method over the estimated development period utilized in the valuation of the tap participation fee 

table of contents obligations payable by hp a m certain of the properties we acquired pursuant to the arkansas river agreement are subject to outstanding promissory notes with principal and accrued interest totaling approximately million at august  these notes are secured by deeds of trust on the properties 
we did not assume any of these promissory notes and are not responsible for making any of the required payments under these notes 
this responsibility remains solely with hp a m 
however  in the event of default by hp a m  we may make payments on any or all of the notes and cure any or all defaults 
if we do not cure the defaults  we will lose the properties securing the defaulted notes and the water rights associated with said properties 
if hp a m defaults on any of the promissory notes  we can foreclose on a defined amount of pure cycle stock issued to hp a m being held in escrow and reduce the tap participation fee by two times the amount of notes defaulted on by hp a m 
although the likelihood of hp a m defaulting on the notes is deemed remote  which is the primary reason these notes are not reflected on our balance sheet  we continue to monitor the status of the notes for any indications of default 
we are not aware of any defaults by hp a m as of august  share based compensation we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards made to key employees and directors on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
we then expense the fair value over the vesting period of the grant using a straight line expense model 
the fair value of share based payments requires management to estimate calculate various inputs such as the volatility of the underlying stock  the expected dividend rate  the estimated forfeiture rate and an estimated life of each option 
these assumptions are based on historical trends and estimated future actions of option holders and may not be indicative of actual events which may have a material impact on our financial statements 
see note to the accompanying financial statements for further details on share based compensation expense 
results of operations executive summary the results of our operations for the fiscal years ended august   and were as follows table g summary results of operations change fiscal years ended august  millions of gallons of water delivered water revenues generated water delivery operating costs incurred excluding depreciation and depletion water delivery gross margin wastewater treatment revenues wastewater treatment operating costs incurred wastewater treatment gross margin general and administrative expenses net losses 
table of contents water and wastewater usage revenues our water service charges are based on a tiered pricing structure that provides for higher prices as customers use greater amounts of water 
our rates and charges are established based on the average of three surrounding water providers 
table b in item business  outlines our tiered pricing structure and changes during the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
our wastewater customers are charged flat monthly fees based on their number of tap connections 
fiscal compared to fiscal water deliveries during fiscal dropped approximately over water deliveries in fiscal  due mainly to precipitation being higher in fiscal  particularly in the late spring and early summer months which are the main irrigation months 
water usage fees in fiscal decreased over fiscal which is mainly a result of the decreased water usage which was partially offset by the increased water usage fees 
wastewater usage fees remained at per wastewater tap per month 
gross margins for water services decreased approximately in compared to this was due to the decreased water usage as noted above 
the decrease in the gross margin percentage was not as large as the decrease in water usage due to our efforts to maintain costs knowing water usage was decreasing 
gross margins for wastewater services in fiscal decreased over fiscal due to timing of various testing procedures 
fiscal compared to fiscal water deliveries during fiscal dropped approximately over water deliveries in fiscal  due mainly to precipitation being higher in fiscal however  water usage fees in fiscal increased over fiscal which is mainly a result of the timing of water usage and an increasing block pricing scale as of july  for an entire fiscal year in versus two months in fiscal wastewater usage fees remained at per wastewater tap per month and before that they increased july   from to per wastewater tap per month 
consistent with water taps  the increased wastewater fees in fiscal is a result of the higher usage fees being charged for the entire fiscal versus two months in fiscal gross margins for water services remained constant from fiscal to fiscal gross margins for wastewater services in fiscal increased over fiscal due to certain testing and compliance expenses incurred during fiscal not experienced in fiscal general and administrative and other expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the fiscal years ended august   and were impacted by the share based compensation expenses as follows amounts are approximate table h g a expenses change fiscal years ended august  g a expenses as reported share based compensation expenses g a expenses less share based compensation expenses 
table of contents the changes in g a expenses  with and without share based compensation expenses  are mainly attributable to the following fiscal compared to fiscal from fiscal to fiscal  g a expenses  without share based compensation expenses  decreased approximately  which is mainly a result of management s cost cutting efforts in light of the poor economy and lack of new home development in our targeted service areas 
specifically  the following accounts decreased during excluding share based compensation expenses our salary and salary related expenses in fiscal and were  and  respectively  which is less than a change 
salary and salary related expenses including share based compensation expenses totaled approximately  and  for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
this decrease is less than 
consulting fees decreased approximately  or  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal this was entirely due to the decrease in use of consultants as a result of the withdrawal of the developer from the lowry range development project 
professional fees legal and accounting decreased approximately  or  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal this is a result of our reduced use of legal counsel as a result of the withdrawal of the developer from the lowry range development project and less activity in water court 
costs associated with being a corporation and costs associated with being a publicly traded entity decreased approximately  or  from  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal this is due primarily to the elimination of franchise fees paid to the state of delaware due to our reincorporation into colorado 
fiscal compared to fiscal from fiscal to fiscal  g a expenses decreased approximately  which is mainly a result of excluding share based compensation expenses our salary and salary related expenses in fiscal and were  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
salary and salary related expenses including share based compensation expenses totaled approximately  and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
the decrease in salaries is mainly attributable to management and employee wages remaining unchanged in and there being no incentive compensation paid in as compared to incentive compensation of  being paid in fiscal upon the completion of the july equity offering 
professional fees legal and accounting totaled approximately  and  for and  respectively 
this decrease of  is a result of legal and accounting bills incurred in fiscal related to our consultations with the staff of the commission which did not recur in costs associated with being a corporation and costs associated with being a publicly traded entity decreased approximately  from  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal this is due primarily to the elimination of franchise fees paid to the state of delaware due to our reincorporation into colorado 
the above decreases were offset by the following significant increases 
during fiscal and  we expensed approximately  and  related to water assessment charges payable to the flcc 
this is an increase of  which is a result of the flcc increasing assessments for the current fiscal year 
this represents our share based on the number of flcc shares we own of flcc s annual operating and maintenance expenditures 
additionally  in fiscal and we expensed approximately  and  respectively  for work performed in the arkansas river valley on our behalf by hp a m 
the increase is a result of increased salaries to the hp a m farm management personnel which resulted in an increase in our costs 
we paid approximately  and  in consulting fees related to our discussions with the former developer of the lowry range concerning the potential development of six sections of the lowry range in fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents depreciation and depletion charges for the fiscal years ended august   and were approximately   and  respectively  which are changes of less than per fiscal year 
interest income totaled approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
this represents interest earned on the temporary investment of capital in cash equivalents or available for sale securities  interest accrued on the note payable by the district and interest accrued on the special facilities construction proceeds receivable from the county 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal of approximately  is due to a significant decline in interest rates due to the recessionary economy and decreasing levels of cash investments 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal of approximately  was due to additional funds being invested in interest bearing accounts as a result of the proceeds raised in the july equity offering 
imputed interest expense related to the tap participation fee payable to hp a m totaled approximately million  million and million for the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
this represents the expensed portion of the difference between the relative fair value of the liability and the net present value of the liability recognized under the effective interest method 
the decreases in the imputed interest expense from fiscal through fiscal is a result of the updated valuations performed in the first quarter of fiscal and the second quarter of fiscal  which are explained in greater detail in note to the accompanying financial statements 
liquidity  capital resources and financial position at august   our working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  was approximately million  approximately million of which consisted of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we also have an effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which we may elect to sell up to another million of stock at any time and from time to time 
we believe that at august   we have sufficient working capital to fund our operations for the next fiscal year 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing the water from our primary water projects in the near term 
in order to generate working capital to support our operations  we may incur additional short or long term debt or seek to sell additional equity securities 
development of the water that we own  have rights to use  or may seek to acquire  will require substantial capital investments 
we anticipate that capital required for the development of the water and wastewater systems will be financed through the sale of water taps to developers and water delivery charges to users 
we anticipate tap fees will be sufficient to generate funds with which we can design and construct the necessary wholesale facilities 
however  once we receive tap fees from a developer  we are contractually obligated to construct those wholesale facilities  even if our costs are not covered by the fees we receive 
we cannot assure you that these sources of cash will be sufficient to cover all our capital costs  in which case we would need to seek additional financing 
pursuant to the arkansas river agreement we agreed to pay hp a m of our water tap fees received on the sale of the next  water taps 
as of august   we have estimated the value of the tap participation fee at approximately million based on a discounted cash flow valuation analysis  which was originally prepared at august   and was updated as of november  and february  see note in the accompanying financial statements for the impact of the revaluation 
the actual amount to be paid will inevitably differ from our estimates 
tap participation payments are not payable to hp a m until we receive water tap fee payments 
we did not sell any taps but did sell some non irrigated land and made tap participation fee payments during the fiscal year ended august  totaling approximately  which is the equivalent of taps and is further described in note to the accompanying financial statements 
as of august   there are  taps that remain subject to the tap participation fee 
we are obligated to pay the flcc annual water assessment charges which are the charges assessed to the flcc shareholders for the upkeep and maintenance of the fort lyon canal 
the payments are payable to the flcc each calendar year 
in december  the board and shareholders of the flcc approved a decrease in the calendar assessments from per share to per share  which equates to a decrease in our water assessments from approximately  per year to approximately  per year 
however  the flcc shareholders also approved a water purchase prior to august  subsequent to our fiscal year end we were notified that our share of the acquired water is approximately  on august   we entered into the county agreement to provide water service to the fairgrounds 
in accordance with gaap  upon completion of construction of the fairgrounds facilities and the initiation of water service to the fairgrounds in july  we began ratably recognizing deferred tap fee revenues as income 
the tap fees received from the county are being recognized in income over the estimated useful life of the constructed assets  or years 
in addition  we started recognizing deferred special facilities funding as revenues in fiscal  which will also be recognized over the useful life of the constructed assets 
see also note to the accompanying financial statements for information regarding the amendment to the county agreement in regards to the special facilities funding and the receipt of water rights in august 
table of contents operating activities operating activities include revenues we receive from the sale of water and wastewater services to our customers  costs incurred in the delivery of those services  g a expenses  and depletion depreciation expenses 
cash used by operating activities was approximately million  million and million for the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
the increase from to was approximately  which is less than 
the decrease of approximately million dollars from fiscal to fiscal is primarily a result of having a gain on the extinguishment of caa interests of approximately  whereas fiscal had a loss on the extinguishment of caa interests of approximately  which is a  fiscal year over fiscal year impact to the cash flow statement 
the remaining difference was due to the timing of payments and receipts related to operating assets 
as a result of the arkansas river agreement signed on august   we imputed approximately million  million and million of interest on the tap participation fee during the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
these are reflected as non cash items in the statements of cash flows 
during the fiscal years ended august   and  we accrued interest on the note receivable from the district of approximately   and  respectively 
the decreases fiscal year over fiscal year are due to falling interest rates due to the economy 
the district note bears interest at prime plus 
we also accrued approximately   and  of interest on the construction proceeds receivable from the county during the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
the decrease in the construction proceeds interest income is a result of payments made by the county since the prior fiscal year  which reduced the interest income recognized pursuant to the effective interest method  and due to the amendment to the county agreement reached with the county as described in note to the accompanying financial statements 
we incurred approximately   and  of depreciation  depletion and other non cash charges during the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
changes per fiscal year are less than 
we will continue to provide domestic water and wastewater service to customers in our service area and we will continue to operate and maintain our water and wastewater systems with our own employees 
investing activities on october  we entered into the denver groundwater purchase agreement the dgpa with the developer of sky ranch 
the dgpa provides us the right to purchase a total of acre feet of adjudicated decreed water rights owned by the developer 
under the dgpa  we have the right to acquire acre feet of water per year or of the total acre feet for a payment of  acquiring the entire acre feet requires payments totaling 
on march  and may   we exercised our rights and purchased a total of acre feet of denver aquifer groundwater for payments totaling  during our fiscal and fiscal we made the two required  payments pursuant to the dgpa  however  we have not received the water rights deeds from the developer  nor has the developer cashed either of the payments 
in november  the developer of sky ranch filed for chapter bankruptcy protection and on august  the developer filed a plan of liquidation 
because of the bankruptcy and since we have not received our water rights deeds from sky ranch  we have cancelled the two un cashed checks issued to sky ranch and have reversed the  that was included in the prepaid expenses account on our balance sheet 
we will continue to monitor the bankruptcy proceedings of sky ranch and vigorously seek to enforce our rights under the dgpa and other sky ranch agreements 
however  our rights related to sky ranch may have no value following the bankruptcy 
refer to the risk factors in item a for additional information on the bankruptcy 
we continue to invest in legal and engineering fees associated with our water rights  and we continue to invest in the right of way permit fees to the department of interior bureau of land management and legal and engineering costs for our paradise water supply 

table of contents cash used provided by investing activities for the fiscal years ended august   and was approximately million   and million  respectively 
investing activities in consisted mainly of the purchase of marketable securities of approximately million and the capitalization of approximately  related to investments in water systems 
investing activities in consisted mainly of  received from the maturity of available for sale securities  offset by  of investments in water rights 
the fiscal cash provided by investing activities was positively impacted by the sale of lawma shares  as more fully described in note to the accompanying financial statements and the sale of approximately million of available for sale securities 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities was approximately   and million the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
financing activities in consisted mainly of approximately  of payments received from the county on the construction note  offset by approximately  of tap participation fee payments made to hp a m as more fully described in note to the accompanying financial statements the cash generated from the non irrigated land sales that resulted in this tap participation fee payment is included in the investing activities above 
financing activities in consisted mainly of  of payments received from the county on the construction note offset by approximately  of debt payments to a related party 
financing activities in fiscal was positively impacted by the million raised in the equity offering offset by the million used to extinguish contingent obligations as described in note to the accompanying financial statements

we signed this lease on august   it is a three year lease with monthly lease payments of approximately  per month 
b the participating interests liability is payable to the caa holders upon the sale of export water  and therefore  the timing of the payments is uncertain and not reflected in the above table by period 
c the tap participation fee payable to hp a m is payable upon the sale of water taps 
because the timing of these water tap sales is not fixed and determinable  the estimated payments are not reflected in the above table by period 
the amount listed above includes an unamortized discount of approximately million 
the valuation of the tap participation fee payable to hp a m is a significant estimate based on available historic market information and estimated future market information 
many factors are necessary to estimate future market conditions  including but not limited to  supply and demand for new homes  population growth along the front range  cash flows  tap fee increases at our rate base districts  and other market forces beyond our control 
because the estimates and assumptions used to value the tap participation fees payable to hp a m are subjective  actual results could vary materially from the estimates 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general pure cycle has limited exposure to market risks from instruments that may impact the balance sheets  statements of operations  and statements of cash flows 
such exposure is due primarily to changing interest rates 
interest rates the primary objective for our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified short term interest bearing investments 
as of august   the majority of our capital is invested in certificates of deposit with stated maturities and locked interest rates and therefore not subject to interest rate fluctuations 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk
