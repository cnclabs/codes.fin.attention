our customers include prominent nationally recognized names such as jenny craig  inc  american airlines  inc  safeway inc  pinnacle foods group llc  panda restaurant group  inc and h 
j 
heinz company 
our goal is to be a leading developer and manufacturer of value added food products and provider of custom prepared frozen foods 
we intend to create superior value for our stockholders by continuing to execute our growth and operating strategies  including diversifying and expanding our customer base by focusing on sectors we believe have attractive growth characteristics  such as foodservice and retail  operating and investing in efficient production facilities  providing value added ancillary support services to customers  offering a broad range of products to customers in multiple channels  and continuing to pursue growth through strategic acquisitions and investments 
overall  we have performed well in the most difficult economic environment since the great depression 
sales to virtually all of our major customers have either decreased or grown less than expected as sales to their customers have decreased  their inventories have been reduced  and their new marketing initiatives delayed 
in addition  as previously disclosed  revenues to one of our significant accounts  h 
j 
heinz company  decreased million as they decided to self manufacture products previously produced by us 
while our foodservice accounts increased during the fiscal year  these gains were not enough to offset other account decreases 
during our fiscal fourth quarter  we were additionally impacted by the seasonality in our retail category  as retailers typically sell fewer frozen meals during warmer months  coupled with aggressive promotional activity from competing national brands 
in spite of all the above  we reported our second best earnings ever  generated million in net cash from operations  reduced long term debt million and increased retained earnings by million 
in addition  we plan to pay another million on our debt by the end of calendar year during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into an agreement with j 
r 
simplot company which designated j 
r 
simplot as the exclusive distributor of certain of our products to some of the nation s largest foodservice accounts 
we believe that this agreement represents a significant opportunity for us in fiscal year and beyond 
in addition  we extended our contracts with two of our largest customers  jenny craig  inc and safeway inc

simplot 
as our top line revenues decreased during fiscal year  our margins  primarily in our fourth quarter  were negatively affected by higher overhead costs as a percentage of net revenues on the lower sales volume 
although we expect continued margin pressure throughout fiscal year  we anticipate margins will improve as sales revenues increase as the economy begins to recover 
however  we believe we can offset the higher overhead costs and minor price concessions through reduced purchase prices of raw materials  production efficiencies and a change in mix of customers between retail  foodservice and airlines 

table of contents fiscal years  and were week periods 
for the fiscal year  net revenues of million reflected a decrease as compared to the fiscal year during fiscal year  decreased sales in the retail and airline category contributed to the decline

the earlier increase in gross profit in dollars and as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to higher margin sales along with on going manufacturing improvements  increased efficiencies and yields and modest increases in sales prices to several customers 
as previously disclosed  in order to improve our gross profit margins  we continue to analyze our lower margin accounts in order to increase margins or change to more profitable business

prior to our fourth quarter  our gross profit as a percentage of revenues was higher than fiscal year due largely to higher margin sales mix along with increased efficiencies and yields  favorable commodity prices  lower freight charges  lower product development costs and modest increases in sales prices to several customers  offset partially by higher overhead costs as a percentage of net revenues on lower sales volume 
in addition  in order to improve our gross profit margins  we continue to analyze our lower margin accounts and expect to move away from some of the accounts that do not meet our profit objectives towards higher margin business currently available to us

table of contents includes real estate leases 
the above table outlines our obligations as of september  and does not reflect the changes in our obligations that occurred after that date 
there have been no material changes to our obligations as of december  recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a standard that defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements 
the standard requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy ie  levels   and  as defined 
additionally  companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the level category  including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities 
the standard became effective for our fiscal year that began on september  the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
as of september   we had financial assets in cash  which are measured at fair value using quoted prices for identical assets in an active market level fair value hierarchy in accordance with the standard 
in february  the fasb issued changes to fair value accounting  which permits a one year deferral of the application of fair value measurements for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the guidance partially defers the effective date of fair value measurement to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this change 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the changes on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a standard on business combinations which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
the standard also modifies the recognition for preacquisition contingencies  such as environmental or legal issues  restructuring plans and acquired research and development value in purchase accounting 
the standard amends the standard on accounting for income taxes  and requires the acquirer to recognize changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable because of a business combination either in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination or directly in contributed capital  depending on the circumstances 
the standard also establishes disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the standard is effective on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the impact to us of the adoption of the standard will depend on the nature and size of any potential future acquisitions 
in december  the fasb issued a standard on the accounting for noncontrolling interests  which clarifies the classification of noncontrolling interests in consolidated statements of financial position and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling interests 
the standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in april  fasb issued changes regarding interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the changes enhance consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures from annually to quarterly 
the changes require disclosures on a quarterly basis of qualitative and quantitative information about fair value estimates for all those financial instruments not measured on the balance sheet at fair value 
the disclosure requirement became effective beginning with our first interim reporting period ending after june  the adoption of this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
on may   the fasb issued a standard related to subsequent events 
the standard is effective for interim or annual periods ending after june  and establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
entities are also required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated and the basis for that date 
we have evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance of these financial statements  december  
table of contents in june  the fasb issued a standard related to the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
the standard will become the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
on the effective date of this standard  the codification will supersede all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered non sec accounting literature not included in the codification will become non authoritative 
this standard is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
see note to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are related to our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk 
our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables 
we perform on going credit evaluations of each customer s financial condition and generally require no collateral from our customers 
a bankruptcy or other significant financial deterioration of any customer could impact its future ability to satisfy its receivables with us 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based primarily upon historical bad debt experience and current market conditions 
bad debt expense and accounts receivable write offs  net of recoveries  historically have been relatively small  as we generally transact the substantial portion of our business with large  established food or service related businesses 
for fiscal years  and  our write offs  net of recoveries  to the allowance for doubtful accounts were approximately   and  respectively 
a significant portion of our total net revenues during the last two fiscal years was derived from four customers 
jenny craig  inc  panda restaurant group  inc  safeway inc 
and h 
j 
heinz company  inc  accounted for approximately   and  respectively of our net revenues for fiscal year and approximately   and  respectively  of our net revenues for fiscal year receivables related to jenny craig  inc  panda restaurant group  inc through its distributors  safeway inc 
and h 
j 
heinz company accounted for approximately   and  respectively of our total accounts receivable balance at september  and approximately   and  respectively  of our total accounts receivable balance at september  inventories 
inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
we use a standard costing system to estimate our fifo cost of inventory at the end of each reporting period 
historically  standard costs have been materially consistent with actual costs 
we periodically review our inventory for excess items  and write it down based upon the age of specific items in inventory and the expected recovery from the disposition of the items 
we write down our inventory for the estimated aged surplus  spoiled or damaged products and discontinued items and components 
we determine the amount of the write down by analyzing inventory composition  expected usage  historical and projected sales information and other factors 
changes in sales volume due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could result in material increases in the write down of our inventory 

table of contents property and equipment 
the cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which range from three to ten years 
leasehold improvements to our plant no 
in vernon  california are amortized over the lesser of the initial lease term plus one lease extension period  initially totaling years  or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
other leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciation is generally computed using the straight line method 
we assess property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost of materials purchased and labor expended in betterments and major renewals are capitalized 
costs and related accumulated depreciation of properties sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts  and gains or losses on disposals are included in operating income 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill at least annually for impairment 
we have one reporting unit and estimate fair value based on a variety of market factors  including discounted cash flow analysis  market capitalization  and other market based data 
at september   we had goodwill of million 
a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect could decrease the estimated fair value of our business and  thus  cause our goodwill to become impaired and cause us to record a charge against operations in an amount representing the impairment 
income taxes 
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets based on whether we believe that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a charge to income at that time
