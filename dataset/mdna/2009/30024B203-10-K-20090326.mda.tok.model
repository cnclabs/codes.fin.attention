item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with  and are qualified by reference to  our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in item of this report and selected financial data included in item of this report 
certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform of refer to the cautionary statement about forward looking statements preceding item of this report 
also  for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business and operations see risk factors in item a of this report 
overview we were founded in  as a cleaner coal technology  energy production and environmental solutions company focused on developing our proprietary technologies 
our goal now is to leverage an integrated technology strategy  including a coal based technology platform and proven production process to deliver a cleaner  more efficient and affordable solid fuel available to meet the growing energy demands of industrial and utility customers while addressing important environmental concerns 
in addition  we are leveraging a science based carbon information management software solution built on a platform of ibm products and solutions to measure greenhouse gases and certify carbon emission reduction credits 
in november  we requested houlihan lokey  an international investment bank  to provide independent advice to our management and board of directors as we continue to explore the strategic positioning of the company 
we expect to consider and evaluate several alternatives during the engagement  including  but not limited to  the potential sale or joint venture of our buckeye subsidiary 
in march  we suspended operations at our fort union plant in order to redirect constrained resources  both capital and human  to focus on the commercialization of this process in future k fuel plants 
suspending production at fort union enabled us to reduce our cash expenditures 
the significant resources invested in the fort union plant served three important purposes first  as an engineering and process improvement platform  the fort union plant allowed evergreen and bechtel engineers and scientists to dramatically improve the performance of the k fuel process 
second  fort union served as an important coal testing facility that allowed evergreen to build a test results database from more than coal types drawn from across the globe 
third  fort union served as an important business development tool and production platform for thousands of tons of k fuel used for marketing and test burn purposes 
to date  we have idled the fort union boiler  processing towers and other equipment at the site and are safeguarding the assets and maintaining the plant in a non operational mode 
while we would be able to resume operations at the fort union plant to demonstrate the technology or to provide k fuel refined coal for test burns at utilities or other industrial sites  we would be required to return equipment to operational status  which could take several months 
as time passes and the plant remains idled  the time and costs to convert it to an operational status will increase 
we continue to evaluate redeploying some of the equipment to a future k fuel facility site 
the consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly and majority owned subsidiaries  including the nine months ended december  for buckeye industrial mining co 
acquisition date of april  
we consolidate all of our majority owned subsidiaries and reflect as minority interest the portion of these entities that we do not own and recorded in other long term liabilities 
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 

table of contents our segments include the c lock segment  plant segment  mining segment and technology segment 
the mining segment primarily represents our mining operations of our subsidiary  buckeye industrial mining co  and includes certain marketing personnel  the ash disposal facility and the preparation and blending facility 
the c lock segment reflects activities related to the measurement of green house gases and certification of environmental improvements as carbon credits 
the plant segment primarily represents revenue and costs related to our fort union plant in gillette  wyoming  at which we suspended operations in march the technology segment is comprised of all other operations that use  apply  own or otherwise advance our proprietary  patented k fuel process  including our headquarters and related operations  activities of evergreen energy asia pacific and kfx technology  llc  which holds the licenses to our technology 
corporate costs within our technology segment are allocated to our other segments  generally on a percentage based on the number of employees  total segment operating expenses  or segment operating expenses plus segment capital expenditures 
significant trends for the last several years  our operations have been focused on developing our technology and the construction of the fort union plant 
as a result  we have limited revenues from k fuel refined coal and  historically most of our costs are related to general and administrative expenses 
with the addition of buckeye  we have begun to generate revenue and incur more substantial mining costs 
in the future  we plan to build  own and operate k fuel and k direct refineries domestically and internationally  both wholly owned and through joint ventures 
through c lock technology we plan to generate future revenues from the measurement of greenhouse gases and certification of environmental improvements as carbon credits 
the following discussion and analysis is focused on the events and trends that we believe have or will in the future have the most significant impact on our business 
revenue trends in the future we expect to generate revenue from the following sources coal sales from our buckeye operations  revenues from the measurement of carbon credits using our web based patented technology  revenues from production facilities including k fuel and k direct plants domestically and internationally  and licensing of our technology  including license fees for constructing a plant and royalty fees for operating a plant 
we have granted certain rights and limited licenses for the use of certain k fuel technology  which may limit our revenue from production of k fuel refined coal to the extent that the rights are exercised 
see item note other assets and note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further details 
expense trends coal mining operating expenses with the acquisition of buckeye  we have incurred mine operating expenses including all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility 
as capital is available  we anticipate increasing our production at our mines 
we expect that the revenue generated from increased production will exceed the incremental mining costs 
fort union in march  we suspended operations at our fort union plant in order to redirect constrained resources  both capital and human  to focus on the commercialization of this process in future k fuel 
table of contents plants 
suspending production at fort union enabled us to reduce our cash expenditures 
overall  while we anticipate costs to decline in  we will continue to incur various costs related to maintaining the site in a non operational mode 
future k fuel and k direct facilities as we build future k fuel and k direct facilities and these facilities begin continuous operation  we will incur additional operational expenses  the most significant being coal transportation costs  raw material costs  outsourced engineering and technical support  plant maintenance costs  plant personnel labor costs  fluid processing costs  by product and water disposal costs  and royalty costs  relating to fees we owe to parties who own certain rights that support our patents and proprietary technology  primarily the koppelman estate 
see further discussion of the royalty owed to the estate of edward koppelman in note other assets in item of this report 
general and administrative expenses as we identify business development opportunities  build new plants  and generally expand our business including hiring additional personnel at our corporate offices  future plants and c lock locations and increasing outsourced professional services  we will incur additional expenses  the most significant of which are payroll and related burdens  non cash  share based compensation  business development costs for potential future k fuel and k direct plants  rent and utilities  and professional support fees 
we anticipate that accounting for non cash  share based compensation will add approximately million to million per year in the foreseeable future to our expenses 
in the event we should achieve certain performance goals  we would significantly accelerate recognition of these costs 
costs such as payroll and related burdens  professional support fees and utilities are variable costs that increase with size and adding locations 
as we build new plants and expand our vertical integration strategy  we expect these costs to increase in future periods 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the same period ended december  
table of contents revenues in our mining segment for the year ended december  were million and million for the same period ended december  respectively  as follows coal revenue includes mined raw and prepared coal sales within our buckeye operations 
buckeye coal sales  including transportation costs charged to customers  were million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
coal sales for the year ended december  were  tons at sales realization per ton sold compared to  tons at sales realization per tons sold for the year ended december  the increase in the sales realization per ton sold for the year ended december  was due to higher coal prices when compared to the year ended december  our production tons for the year ended december   were less than anticipated due to power outages and other weather issues related to hurricane ike 
in addition  we experienced unexpected adverse roof conditions resulting from clay vein slip areas in a section of one of our underground mining veins 
we have resolved the roof conditions by using longer bolts in each of the main entries  more bolts and narrowing the belt entry 
we were also required to obtain the mine safety and health administrations approval of the revised roof control and ventilation plans  which took longer than anticipated 
we believe that all issues are resolved and buckeye is now producing at expected levels 
we anticipate coal prices to remain consistent with the prices in brokered coal sales  net include the revenues reduced by costs associated with the purchase of coal from other coal producers  which we ship directly to customers 
we recognized  of net revenue for the year ended december  compared to  of net revenue for the year ended december  we enter into brokered coal sales as opportunities arise or as needed to meet certain customers requests  and as a result  revenues in this area fluctuate 
ash disposal revenues primarily include revenues generated from the disposal of coal combustion bi products at our ash pit in ohio 
ash disposal revenues were million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
k fuel refined coal revenue is comprised of sales of our k fuel product to third parties 
blended k fuel refined coal revenue represents the proportionate revenue related to k fuel that has been blended with other raw or prepared coal from our buckeye operations and sold to third parties 
the remaining revenue related to the raw or prepared coal is reflected in mining revenues 
k fuel refined coal and blended k fuel refined coal sales were  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively and are included in our plant segment 
coal mining operating expenses our coal mining operating expenses include all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility at buckeye  which principally comprises our mining segment 
coal mining operating expenses coal mining operating expenses include employee related costs  outside contracted mining costs for our underground mines  internal and external coal transportation costs  blasting  drilling  heavy equipment costs  purchased coal and other mining related costs 
coal mining operating expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cost per ton in comparing the year ended december  to is primarily due to the increased price of fuel used to mine and transport coal 
ash disposal ash disposal expenses include employee related costs  consulting costs  costs of repairs and maintaining culverts and drainage ponds  transportation  and heavy equipment costs and other costs

research and development costs were  and  for the years ended and  respectively 
as a result of cost cutting measures  we decreased the number of employees and the corresponding salary and wages in our lab at our gillette site 
asset impairment charges asset impairment charges were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
asset impairment charges for the year ended december   relate to further impairment of our boiler island which was classified as assets held for sale 
see note assets held for sale in item of this report for further details 
impairment charges for the year ended december  are as follows we suspended operations at our fort union plant to allow us to focus on future k fuel or k direct plants by redirecting constrained resources  both capital and human  to focus on the commercialization of our process 
we incurred impairment charges in our plant segment totaling million 
pursuant to the guidance of statements of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  we are required to evaluate the fair value of our boiler  which is classified as held for sale 
as result  of this fair value calculation we impaired the carrying value of our boiler by million in our technology segment  we impaired million of capitalized costs related to projects that we abandoned and or replaced with more cost effective projects in our plant segment  and we impaired capital costs of million related to a previously announced future potential project with a major utility because it was determined not to be economically feasible in our technology segment 

table of contents other income expense interest income interest income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income for the year ended december  was principally attributable to a lower cash balance as well as reduced interest rates during interest expense interest expense for the years ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
interest expense relates to the million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible secured notes due  which we completed in july the increase in interest expense is in direct relation to the time and amount of the notes outstanding in compared to we anticipate interest expense to significantly decrease in future periods due to the conversion of of these outstanding convertible secured notes 
gain on debt for equity exchange transactions during the year ended december   we entered into multiple individually negotiated agreements with certain existing noteholders to exchange million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible secured notes due  for an aggregate of million shares of our common stock 
we recognized a million gain  which was reduced by transaction costs  non cash reversal of debt issue costs and non cash adjustment related to the embedded derivatives 
other income expense during the year ended december   other expense was  as compared to million of other expense for the same period ended pursuant to fas  we estimated the fair value of the embedded derivatives as of july   when the notes were issued  and recorded those values as either assets or liabilities 
in addition  we are required to evaluate the fair value of the embedded derivatives at the end of each subsequent reporting period 
we recognized a decrease in the fair value of the derivatives of  for the year ended december  this fair value adjustment is a non cash item and each quarter s estimation exercise is impacted  in part  by our stock price 
for additional information  see note debt included in item of this report 
in addition we recognized a  gain for insurance reimbursements for cost incurred to repair certain equipment at our fort union plant for the year ended december  comparison of years ended december  and revenue revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the same period ended december  the increase in revenue primarily relates to our april acquisition of buckeye 
during the year ended december   we owned buckeye for only nine months 
during the year ended december   we owned buckeye for the entire twelve month period 
revenues in our mining segment for the year ended december  were million and million for the same period ended december  respectively  as follows buckeye coal sales  including transportation costs charged to customers  for the year ended december  were million or  tons at sales realization per ton sold and million or  tons at sales realization per ton sold for the period ended december  the decrease in the sales realization per ton sold for the year ended december  was due to a mix of types of coals sold during and downward pressure on coal pricing  particularly during the first quarter of resulting from depressed 
table of contents international coal prices 
during periods of depressed coal pricing  we strategically adjust the mix of coal we produce to focus less on our premium coals 
as prices had improved in  we increased production of our premium coals and our sales realization per ton increased in  as compared to we recognized  of net revenue for the year ended december  compared to  of net revenue for the year ended december  we enter into brokered coal sales as opportunities arise or as needed to meet certain customers requests  and as a result  revenues in this area fluctuate 
ash disposal revenues were million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
k fuel refined coal and blended k fuel refined coal sales were million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively and are included in our plant segment 
k fuel refined coal sales were less than expected primarily due to less production at our fort union plant for both periods 
coal mining operating expenses coal mining operating expenses coal mining operating expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase can be attributed to the acquisition of buckeye in april  resulting in recording nine months of buckeye s operation for the year ended december  compared to recording twelve months of buckeye s operations for the year ended december  ash disposal ash disposal expenses were million and million for the periods ended december  and  respectively

the following table summarizes our insurance and other costs related to each of our segments for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands technology plant mining c lock total insurance and other the increase for the year ended december  compared to the same period ended can be attributed to the following a licensing fee paid to the owner of the proprietary technology for the measurement of carbon emissions related to the formation of our subsidiary  c lock technology  inc  which is reflected in the c lock segment  increase in insurance due to the acquisition of buckeye  which is reflected in the mining segment  increase in business development costs associated with the identification of key public utility leads  which are candidates for our process  and development of those leads  which is reflected in the technology segment  and overall increase in property and commercial liability premiums for our fort union plant  which is reflected in the plant segment 
plant costs plant costs were higher than anticipated due to general start up issues with this first of a kind plant and technical and operation improvements being implemented 
plant costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the majority of the year ended december   we were in the construction and commissioning phases and most of the costs incurred during these phases were capitalized 
during the year ended december   we were in the start up phase and a higher percentage of costs associated with the operations of our fort union plant were expensed as incurred 
in addition  non capitalized costs increased as a result of engineering and technical work performed to improve and reconfigure our fort union plant 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization are comprised of depreciation on our fort union plant using the units of production method  based on actual tons processed and depreciation on other fixed assets using the straight line method  depletion  based on actual tons mined at our mine sites in ohio  and amortization related to our patents 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period ended the increases are primarily attributable to the acquisition of buckeye and the related depreciation and depletion on our mine sites and property and equipment for the year ended december  
table of contents research and development research and development costs were  and million for the years ended and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily a result of our fort union plant entering the start up phase of operation  which resulted in costs that were previously classified as research and development now being classified as plant costs 
asset impairment charges asset impairment charges were million for december  and were previously described 
asset impairment charges were  for the year ended december  other income expense interest income interest income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  is attributed to interest earned on our cash balance  which was significantly lower compared to the same period in interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  and december  was million and  respectively

on november   we completed an equity exchange transaction with rio tinto energy america services company rtea  formerly kennecott energy company 
as a part of the exchange transaction  an intercompany working capital loan from evergreen energy to pegasus technologies inc with an outstanding balance of million was exchanged for a contingent earn out agreement of up to million in the aggregate  plus accrued interest prime rate plus basis points  payable out of a portion of future cash flows generated by pegasus 
due to the contingent nature of this potential stream of future cash flows  we did not recognize an asset or any associated income at the time of the exchange transaction 
on may   rtea entered into a transaction involving its investment in pegasus 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement entered into between us and rtea dated november   which triggered the earn out provision  we received a payment of million during the year ended december  from pegasus as a payment in full satisfaction of the million contingent obligation 
this transaction had no effect on our note receivable from pegasus 
liquidity and capital resources discussion during  we have reduced our cash flow used in operations by million  when compared to we accomplished these savings principally by suspending operations at our fort union plant  reducing professional fees and other general and administrative costs 
these cost reductions were offset by the expansion of our c lock operations  including the addition of personnel and other administrative costs associated with developing a business 
in addition  we have invested million in capital expenditures  primarily related to buckeye  c lock s software development and completion of 
table of contents the k fuel enhanced tower design and other k fuel process development 
the capital expenditures related to buckeye were related to capitalizable maintenance and acquisition of certain equipment  which has positioned it to expand its production in and thereafter 
as previously mentioned  we are evaluating several strategic alternatives including  but not limited to  the potential sale or joint venture of buckeye 
if this evaluation indicates that sale or joint venture of buckeye is not appropriate at this time  we will retain and continue to operate it 
alternatively  sale or joint venture of buckeye could provide evergreen with immediate access to significant capital that could be reinvested in the growth of our c lock and k fuel energy technologies 
in order to ensure that we had sufficient operating capital  we entered into the financing arrangement described below to provide financial flexibility as we complete this evaluation 
on march   we executed a senior secured convertible note agreement which provides for the issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured promissory notes the notes in three million tranches 
the first million tranche was funded on march  the second million tranche  which must be drawn  will be funded upon our request no later than april  and upon satisfaction that all conditions precedent to closing have been met 
the third tranche is available to be drawn at any time prior to the maturity of the notes upon our request and upon satisfaction that all conditions precedent to closing have been met 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum beginning on the funding date of each tranche through december   and all interest is required to be prepaid at the time the note is issued and is non refundable 
the notes are secured by all of buckeye s assets and evergreen operation llc s equity interest in buckeye 
the notes will mature at the earlier of december  or the sale of buckeye and may be prepaid in whole or in part 
upon repayment  we will pay the face amount of the notes outstanding at the rate of if repaid by june   if repaid after june  but before september  and thereafter 
the holder of the notes may  at its option and at any time prior to the maturity date  convert such notes  in whole or in part  into our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
in addition to other covenants  the note purchase agreement places limits on the ability of buckeye to incur additional indebtedness or incur other liens upon its property 
please see a detailed description of the notes in item b other information or note debt in item of this report 
in july  we completed a convertible debt offering that provided us with approximately million  net of amounts held in escrow and offering costs 
during the year ended december   we entered into multiple individually negotiated agreements with certain existing noteholders to exchange million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible secured notes due  for an aggregate of million shares of our common stock 
we issued all the shares by december except for million  which represents million of principal value of the notes 
during the first quarter of  we closed additional portions of this remaining transaction and issued an aggregate of million shares  representing million of principal value of notes 
we anticipate the remaining conversion to take place in these exchange transactions will dramatically reduce the interest we owe related to these notes in further  we received the requisite consents to amend the indenture and  in compliance with the terms and provisions of the indenture  we  each of the guarantors and the trustee  executed a supplemental indenture the supplemental indenture 
see further discussion in note debt in item of this report 
we believe because of the actions described above  along with the anticipated cash flows from our buckeye operations  the proceeds of the senior secured convertible note agreement described above and the ability to adjust capital and certain operational spending  our current cash level is sufficient to support our corporate and other operations for the foreseeable future 
however  if buckeye experiences unexpected declines in production for any reason  including but not limited to  heavy rains or flooding  slow downs or suspension of operations for geologic or any other unanticipated reason  it could adversely impact our cash flow from operations 
further  continued market disruptions associated 
table of contents with the global credit crisis could cause broader economic downturns  which may lead to lower demand for our technology or products  increased incidence of customers inability to pay their accounts  or insolvency of our customers  any of which could adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity  cash flows  and financial condition 
we continue to evaluate our cash position and cash utilization and may make additional adjustments to capital or certain operating expenditures 
as we complete our strategic evaluation and identify alternatives  or as opportunities arise to construct k fuel facilities  further expand buckeye s production volumes  accelerate our c lock operations  or our anticipated operating cash flows are less than expected  due to among other things  lower than anticipated production at buckeye or a protracted global credit crisis  we may need to obtain additional funding 
we plan to seek additional capital from time to time as needed principally through equity offerings  debt or debt offerings  partnering with third parties in the construction and operation for some of our large scale commercial plants through the formation of joint ventures  and sales or potential joint venture of certain assets 
while we believe we will obtain additional capital through one or more of the alternatives described  we can provide no assurance that any of the alternatives will be available to us or be on terms acceptable to us

for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
these policies and estimates are considered critical because they either had a material impact or they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements  and because they require significant judgments  assumptions or estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements in this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect both the results of operations as well as the carrying values of our assets and liabilities 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base estimates on historical experience and or on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term 
set forth below is a summary of our most critical accounting policies 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  generally when an agreement has been signed  all significant obligations have been satisfied  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
any up front fees received are deferred and recognized over the provision of specific deliverables as defined in the agreements 
as our history related to non coal sale customer relationships is limited  we may be required to change the estimated period over which we recognize our revenue as more information becomes available 
arrangements that include multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine whether the elements are separable based on objective evidence 
if the elements are deemed separable  total consideration is allocated to each element and the revenue associated with each element is recognized as earned 
if the elements are not deemed separable  total consideration is deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or the expected customer relationship period 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to customer relationship periods and to the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable are critical accounting estimates because they require management to make assumptions about how long we will retain customers  for which we have limited history  the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable can be subjective  and the impact of changes in actual retention periods versus these estimates on the revenue amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material 
accounts and notes receivable and allowances 
receivables are recorded at their estimated net realizable value 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the past due status of receivables and assessments of risk regarding collectability 
if the financial condition of the customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
capitalization of costs 
we expense mine exploration costs as incurred 
once it has been determined that it is economically feasible to extract coal  we begin to capitalize these costs as premining costs 
we have identified the commencement of permitting as the point to begin capitalizing premining costs 
we also capitalize all purchases of machinery  equipment  software  engineering costs and similar expenditures  where the useful life of the asset is greater than one year or the expenditures extends the useful life of an existing asset 
all costs that are directly related to  or allocable to  developing a k fuel plant site are capitalized and separately identified as belonging to that site 
judgment is exercised in determining i if costs extend the life of an asset  ii if costs increase production volumes  and iii the feasibility of extracting coal 
if these judgments are incorrect  we may capitalize more costs than we otherwise should 
mineral rights and mine development 
a significant portion of our coal reserves are controlled through leasing arrangements 
costs to obtain coal lands and leased mineral rights  including capitalized premining costs  are capitalized and depleted to operations using the units of production method based on tons produced utilizing only proven and probable reserves in the depletion base and are assumed to have no residual value 
premining costs include drilling  permitting  county and state filing fees and the initial overburden removal 
we used assumptions such as selling price of coal  costs to mine and a discount rate to value our mines at buckeye 
if the assumptions used to value the proven and probable reserves change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
valuation of long lived assets 
the valuation of our long lived and intangible assets  including the remaining assets at our fort union plant  mineral rights  and patents  have significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we must assess the realizable value of these assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we 
table of contents must make assumptions regarding the useful lives of these assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
asset retirement obligations 
we are required to record the fair value of legally required removal costs and retirement obligations as a liability and we also recorded an offsetting asset 
initially  our asset retirement obligations were recorded at their fair value using an expected cash flow approach  in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflected the range of possible outcomes and a credit adjusted risk free rate were applied 
the liability is then accreted over time by applying the interest method of allocation 
in determining the initial liability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
in addition  the rate of accretion is based upon our best estimate of the rate at which cost to complete the reclamation will increase 
if these estimates and their related assumptions are incorrect or change in the future  we may be required to increase our obligation 
accounting for stock grants  options and warrants 
we issue stock grants  options and warrants to employees  board of directors and consultants in connection with our various business activities 
in accounting for these awards we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the related instruments  the periods benefited and forfeiture rates 
these estimates may affect such financial statement categories as stockholders equity and general and administrative expense 
if these estimates are incorrect  we may be required to incur additional expense in the future 
accounting for derivative financial instruments 
derivatives may be embedded in financial instruments the host instrument 
embedded derivatives are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to those of the host instrument  the terms of the embedded derivative are similar to those of a stand alone derivative and the combined contract is not held for trading or designated at fair value 
these embedded derivatives are measured at fair value and any subsequent changes are recognized in the statement of operations 
we are required to make estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  estimating the future market price of our common stock and probability of a change in control 
if these assumptions and estimates are incorrect  we may be required to incur additional expense in the future 
if our expected volatility of our common stock decreased by  the impact would have been an increase in other expenses of  if our expected volatility of our common stock increased by  the impact would have been an increase in other income of  accounting for acquisitions 
the acquisition of businesses is an element of our strategy 
we are required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect our financial statements 
for example  the value and estimated life of assets may affect the amount of future period depletion and depreciation expense for the assets as well as possible impairment charges that may be incurred 
marketable securities 
we classify our marketable securities as available for sale 
as of december  and  we had available for sale investments in auction rate securities with a carrying value of million and million  respectively 
the types of auction rate securities investments that we own are backed by student loans and all had credit ratings of aaa or aaa when purchased 
the interest rates on these auction rate securities are reset every to days by an auction process 
as a result of the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  in february and march  auctions for a certain ars investment held by us failed 
the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us and other investors from liquidating the holdings of auction rate securities in recent auctions for these securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 

table of contents during the quarter ended march  we liquidated  at par  million in student loan backed auction rate securities 
as of december   our consolidated balance sheet reflects million of such securities in other long term assets 
during the year ended december   we reduced the carrying amount of our student loan backed auction rate security by an other than temporary impairment of  our estimate of the fair value of such securities is based upon consideration of various factors including the overall credit market  the issuer and guarantor credit ratings  credit enhancement structures  projected yields  discount rates and terminal periods 
if the issuer and guarantor are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of our investment in auction rate securities further 
on february   we entered a reverse repurchase transaction for our million auction rate security  with our banking institution 
through the reverse repurchase transaction  we are able to borrow up of the par value of the auction rate security with interest rate comparable to the interest earned on the auction rate security

table of contents in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb standard position fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
this fsp requires issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion to account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
issuers will need to determine the carrying value of just the liability portion of the debt by measuring the fair value of a similar liability including any embedded features other than the conversion option that does not have an associated equity component 
the excess of the initial proceeds received from the debt issuance and the fair value of the liability component should be recorded as a debt discount with the offset recorded to equity 
the discount will be amortized to interest expense using the interest method over the life of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component 
transaction costs incurred with third parties shall be allocated between the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs  respectively  with the debt issuance costs amortized to interest expense 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to risks inherent in operations  we are exposed to the following market risks in our business some of the products used in our mining activities  such as diesel fuel and explosives  are subject to commodity price risk 
we expect to consume million to million gallons of fuel per year 
on a per gallon basis  based on this usage  a change in fuel prices of one cent per gallon would result in an increase in our operating costs of approximately  per year 
alternatively  a one dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs by approximately  ignoring embedded derivatives  we own or hold no derivative instruments or floating rate debt and do not expect to derive a material amount of our revenues from such interest bearing securities 
currently  we have no significant foreign operations 
we hold no equity market securities  which are subject to equity market risk relative to our own equity securities
