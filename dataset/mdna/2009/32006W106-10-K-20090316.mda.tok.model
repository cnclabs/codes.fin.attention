table of contents financial condition assets at december  totaled billion compared to billion at december   an increase of million or 
the majority of first defiance s asset growth was due in large part to the pavilion acquisition which added approximately million in assets 
the increase in assets was funded through growth in deposits  which increased by million or  to billion at december  from billion at december  for more details on the impact the pavilion acquisition had on the balance sheet  see note acquisitions in the notes to the financial statements 
securities the securities portfolio increased million to million at december  the activity in the portfolio in included million of purchases  million of acquired securities  million of amortization and maturities and a net decrease of million in market value on available for sale securities

excluding the pavilion acquisition  gross loans receivable increased by million or in for more details on the loan balances acquired in the pavilion acquisition  see note loans receivable and or note acquisitions in the notes to the financial statements 
the majority of first defiance s non residential real estate and commercial loans are to small and mid sized businesses 
the combined commercial  non residential real estate and multi family real estate loan portfolios totaled billion and million at december  and respectively and accounted for approximately and of first defiance s loan portfolio at the end of those respective periods 
first defiance believes it has been able to establish itself as a leader in its market area in the commercial and commercial real estate lending area by hiring experienced lenders and providing a high level of customer service to its commercial lending clients 
the one to four family residential portfolio  including residential construction loans  totaled million at december   up from million at the end of at the end of those loans comprised of the total loan portfolio  up from at december  home equity and home improvement loans grew to million at december   up from million at the end of for both periods  home equity and improvement loans represented of total loans 
consumer finance loans were just million at december   up from million at the end of these loans comprised just and of the total portfolio at december  and respectively 

table of contents allowance for loan losses and classified assets the allowance for loan losses represents management s assessment of the estimated probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses regularly through reviews of the loan portfolio 
consideration is given to economic conditions  changes in interest rates and the effect of such changes on collateral values and borrower s ability to pay  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  and trends in past due and non performing loan balances 
the allowance for loan losses is a material estimate that is susceptible to significant fluctuation and is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio 
in addition to extensive in house loan monitoring procedures  the company utilizes an outside party to conduct an independent loan review of all commercial loan and commercial real estate loan relationships that exceed  of aggregate exposure 
management utilizes the results of this outside loan review to assess the effectiveness of its internal loan grading system as well as to assist in the assessment of the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses associated with these types of loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million compared to million at december   an increase of million or 
those balances represented and of outstanding loans as of december  and december  respectively 
the increase was mainly the result of the deterioration of economic conditions in that posed many challenges for the banking industry 
real estate values have declined and some collateral dependent loans no longer have enough collateral value to support the outstanding balance 
management has expanded its credit monitoring functions in response to the deteriorated market conditions 
additional asset review functions and more delinquent loan reporting requirements have been added to assist in this monitoring 
management will continually review credit concentrations by the industry and has placed lower limits on lending within certain types of loan categories 
management has also segmented the commercial real estate portfolio to track the general performance of these segments to further refine the predictive process of identifying potential problem loans 
of the million of net charge offs in   was provided for in the allowance for loan losses at december  total classified loans increased to million at december   compared to million at december  at december   a total of million of loans are classified as substandard for which some level of reserve ranging between and of the outstanding balance is required 
a total of million in additional credits were classified as substandard at december  for which no reserve is required because of factors such as the level of collateral or the strength of guarantors 
first defiance also has classified  of assets doubtful at december  by contrast  at december   a total of million of loans were classified as substandard for which some level of reserve was required and million were classified as substandard which did not require any reserve 
 was classified as doubtful at december  first defiance s ratio of allowance for loan losses to non performing loans dropped from at the end of to at december  management monitors collateral values of all loans included on the watch list that are collateral dependent and believes that allowances for those loans at december  are appropriate 

table of contents at december   first defiance had total non performing assets of million  compared to million at december  non performing assets include loans that are days past due  restructured loans and all real estate owned and other foreclosed assets 
non performing assets at december  and by category were as follows december in thousands non performing loans single family residential construction non residential and multi family residential real estate commercial consumer finance restructured loans  still accruing total non performing loans real estate owned and repossessed assets total non performing assets the increase in non performing loans between december  and december  is primarily in non residential and multi family real estate and commercial loans 
the combined balance of these types of non performing loans was million higher at december  compared to december  approximately million of non performing loans are still considered non performing loans at december  and no real estate owned at december  was in non performing non residential real estate loans at december  the commercial and non residential real estate and multi family real estate loans that are non performing at december  are comprised of seventy seven relationships  with eleven relationships making up million of the million total 
the allowance for loan losses includes million for those eleven relationships 
by comparison  at december   nineteen loans made up the million of commercial and non residential real estate and multi family real estate loans that were non performing and the largest two loans comprised million of the total 
non performing loans in the single family residential  non residential and multi family residential real estate and commercial loan categories represent  and of the total loans in those categories respectively at december  compared to  and respectively for the same categories at december  while the level of non performing loans has increased  year over year  management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is appropriate and that the provision for loan losses recorded in is consistent with both charge off experience and the strength of the overall credits in the portfolio 
management also assesses the value of real estate owned as of the end of each accounting period and recognizes write downs to the value of that real estate in the income statement if conditions dictate 
in  first defiance recorded oreo write downs that totaled  these amounts were included in other non interest expense 
management believes that the values recorded at december  for real estate owned and repossessed assets represent the realizable value of such assets 
first defiance also utilizes a general reserve percentage for loans not otherwise classified which ranges from for mortgage loans to for commercial and non residential real estate loans 
the reserve percentage utilized for those loans is based on both historical losses in the company s portfolio  national statistics on loss percentages provided by the fdic  and empirical evidence regarding the strength of the economy in the first defiance s general market area 
loans acquired with impairment certain loans acquired in the combanc  genoa  and pavilion acquisitions had evidence that the credit quality of the loan had deteriorated since its origination and in management s assessment at the acquisition date it was probable that first defiance would be unable to collect all contractually required payments due 
in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer sop  these loans were recorded based on management s estimate of the fair value of the loans 
at the acquisition date of january   loans with a 
table of contents contractual receivable of million were acquired from combanc which were deemed impaired 
those loans were recorded at a net realizable value of million 
on april   loans with contractual receivable totals of million were acquired from genoa which were deemed impaired 
those loans were recorded at a net realizable value of  on march   loans with contractual receivable totals of million were acquired from pavilion and were deemed impaired 
those loans were recorded at a net realizable value of million 
as of december   the total contractual receivable for those loans was million and the recorded value was million 
high loan to value mortgage loans the majority of first defiance s mortgage loans are collateralized by one to four family residential real estate  have loan to value ratios of or less  and are made to borrowers in good credit standing 
first federal usually requires residential mortgage loan borrowers whose loan to value is greater than to purchase private mortgage insurance pmi 
management also periodically reviews and monitors the financial viability of its pmi providers 
first federal does originate and retain a limited number of residential mortgage loans with loan to value ratios that exceed where pmi is not required if the borrower possesses other demonstrable strengths 
the loan to value ratios on these loans are generally limited to and exceptions must be approved by first federal s senior loan committee 
management monitors the balance of one to four family residential loans  including home equity loans and committed lines of credit that exceed certain loan to value standards for owner occupied residences  for non owner occupied residences and one to four family construction loans  for developed land and for raw land 
total loans that exceed those standards at december  were million  compared to million at december  these loans are generally paying as agreed 
first defiance does not make interest only first mortgage residential loans  nor does it have residential mortgage loan products  or other consumer products that allow negative amortization 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill increased million to million at december   from million at december   the result of the pavilion acquisition 
no impairment of goodwill was recorded in or core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets increased million during to million from million at the end of the pavilion acquisition increased intangibles by million in  which was offset by the recognition of million of amortization expense during the year 
deposits total deposits at december  were billion compared to billion at december   an increase of million or 
through the acquisition of pavilion  first defiance acquired deposits including purchase accounting adjustments of million in non interest bearing checking accounts  million in interest bearing checking accounts  million in savings accounts  and million in certificates of deposit 
excluding the pavilion acquisition  total deposits grew million in non interest bearing checking accounts grew by million  money market and interest bearing checking accounts grew by million  savings grew by million  and certificates of deposit increased by million 
management periodically utilizes the national market for certificates of deposit to supplement its funding needs 
the balance of national cd s increased to million at december   from  at december  for more details on the deposit balances in general or those acquired in the pavilion acquisition  see note deposits and or note acquisitions in the notes to the financial statements 

table of contents borrowings fhlb advances totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the balance at the end of includes million of convertible advances with rates ranging from to 
these advances are all callable by the fhlb  at which point they would convert to a three month libor advance if not paid off 
those advances have final maturity dates ranging from to in addition  first defiance has advances totaling million that are callable by the fhlb only if the three month libor rate exceeds a strike rate ranging from to 
the rate on those advances ranges from to 
first defiance also has million of three month libor based advances with rates ranging from to 
first defiance also has million of fixed rate advances with rates ranging from to and has million of overnight advances at december  first defiance also has million of securities that have been sold at december  with agreements to repurchase  compared to million of repurchase funding at december  in march  the company issued million of subordinated debentures 
these debentures were issued to an unconsolidated affiliated trust that purchased them with the proceeds from a million issue of trust preferred securities to an outside party 
the proceeds of the subordinated debentures were used for general corporate purposes 
the subordinated debentures have a fixed rate equal to for the first five years and a floating interest rate based on three month libor plus thereafter 
first defiance also has million of subordinated debentures issued in which have a rate equal to three month libor plus  or at december  capital resources total shareholders equity increased million to million at december  this increase is primarily the result of the company s million of net income  million of common stock issued in conjunction with the acquisition of pavilion for more information on the pavilion acquisition  see the above caption overview  and million of preferred stock issued to the u 
s treasury for more information relating to the preferred stock issuance  see the above caption recent market developments 
the increases were offset by million of common dividends per share declared and the company s repurchase of its common stock 
in  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of  shares 
a total of  shares were repurchased in under that program at an average cost of per share  thus reducing stockholders equity by  a total of  shares remain to be purchased under the authorization 
participation in the cpp prohibits the company from repurchasing its common shares without prior approval of the us treasury until the earlier of december  or the date the treasury s preferred stock is redeemed or transferred to an unaffiliated third party 
results of operations summary first defiance reported net income of million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net income applicable to common shares was million in on a diluted per common share basis  first defiance earned in  in and in the net income amount includes million of acquisition related costs that were incurred as part of the pavilion acquisition 
these costs included such items as the expense to terminate certain contracts  retention bonuses with key employees  and other costs resulting from the acquisition or related transition efforts 
after tax  these costs amounted to  or per share 
excluding these items  core earnings were million for the year ended december  on a diluted per share basis  core 
table of contents earnings amounted to  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
management believes that the presentation of the non gaap financial measures assists when comparing results period to period in a meaningful and consistent manner and provides a better measure of results for first defiance s ongoing operations 
a reconciliation of gaap earnings to core earnings is as follows year ended december  in thousands gaap net income one time acquisition related charges tax effect core operating earnings basic earnings per common share gaap core operating earnings diluted earnings per common share gaap core operating earnings net interest income first defiance s net interest income is determined by its interest rate spread ie the difference between the yields on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the tax equivalent net interest margin was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in margin between and is due to a widening of the interest rate spread  which increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the increase in spread between and was a result of the cost of interest bearing liabilities between the two periods decreasing by basis points to in from in  which is offset by interest earning asset yields decreasing by basis points to in from in 
the pavilion acquisition coupled with the average balance of non interest bearing deposits increasing million in from contributed to the margin improvement 
the decrease in margin between and is due to a declining interest rate spread  which decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the decline in spread between and occurred due to interest earning asset yields increasing by just basis points to in from in while the cost of interest bearing liabilities between the two periods increased by basis points to in from in 
the margin compression caused by the narrowing interest rate spread was mitigated somewhat by a million increase in the average balance of non interest bearing deposits in compared to and an million increase in average shareholders equity between the two periods 
total interest income increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income was due to an increase in the average balance in loans receivable  to billion for the twelve months of compared to billion for interest income from loans increased to million for compared to million in which represented growth of

provisions for loan losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
factors considered by management include identifiable risk in the portfolios  historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by first defiance  the amount of non performing assets  including loans which meet the fasb statement no 
definition of impaired  the amount of assets graded by management as substandard  doubtful  or loss  general economic conditions  particularly as they relate to first defiance s market areas  and other factors related to the collectability of first defiance s loan portfolio 
see also allowance for loan losses in management s discussion and analysis and note to the audited financial statements 
non interest income non interest income decreased by million or in to million from million for the year ended december  that followed an increase of million or in from million in service fees and other charges increased to million for the year ended december  from million for and million for  an increase of million or from to and an increase of million  or from to the growth in fee income in is primarily related to the additional accounts acquired in the pavilion acquisition 
the growth in was primarily related to checking account charges  the result of the implementation of an overdraft product in march of 
table of contents first defiance s overdraft privilege program generally provides for the automatic payment of modest overdraft limits on all accounts deemed to be in good standing when the account is accessed using paper based check processing  a teller withdrawal  a point of sale terminal  an ach transaction  or an atm 
to be in good standing  an account must be brought to a positive balance within a day period 
overdraft limits are established for all customers without discrimination using a risk assessment approach for each account classification 
the approach includes a systematic review and evaluation of the normal deposit flows made to each account classification to establish reasonable and prudent negative balance limits that would be routinely repaid by normal  expected and reoccurring deposits 
the risk assessment by portfolio approach assumes a minimal degree of undetermined credit risk associated with unidentified individual accounts that are overdrawn for or more days 
accounts overdrawn for more than days are automatically charged off 
fees are charged as a one time fee per occurrence and the fee charged for an item that is paid is equal to the fee charged for a non sufficient fund item that is returned 
overdrawn balances  net of allowance for losses  are reflected as loans on first defiance s balance sheet 
the fees charged for this service are established based both on the return of processing costs plus a profit  and on the level of fees charged by competitors in the company s market area for similar services 
these fees are considered to be compensation for providing a service to the customer and therefore deemed to be non interest income rather than interest income 
fee income recorded for the years ending december  and related to the overdraft privilege product  net of adjustments to the allowance for uncollectible overdrafts  were million and  respectively 
accounts charged off are included in non interest expense 
the period over period increase is due to the increased usage of the program by customers coupled with the additional accounts acquired in the pavilion acquisition 
the allowance for losses was established june  with a balance of  the allowance for losses was  at december  and  at december  non interest income also includes investment securities gains or losses 
in  first defiance realized a million loss on securities compared to a  gain in and a  loss in in  first defiance recognized other than temporary impairment otti charges for certain impaired investment securities  where in management s opinion  the value of the investment will not be recovered 
in the third quarter of  a million otti charge was recorded relating to the perpetual preferred securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac 
the otti was determined by management as a result of the action taken by the united states treasury department and the federal housing finance agency on september   which placed fannie mae and freddie mac into conservatorship 
first defiance invested million each in preferred stock of fannie mae and freddie mac in january of and as of september   that stock had a combined market value of  the combined market value as of december  was  but management believes that the decline in market value from september  is not otti 
also in  management recorded million of otti on its investment in the equity notes of three trust preferred collateralized debt obligations cdos as a result of management s analysis of the securities 
at december   the market value of those cdos  which had a total original cost of million  had been written down to  there was only a minor amount of sales activity in the investment portfolio in and mortgage banking income includes gains from the sale of mortgage loans  fees for servicing mortgage loans for others  and an offset for amortization of mortgage servicing rights  and adjustments for impairment in the value of mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage banking income totaled million  million and million in  and respectively 
the  decline in from was primarily attributable to the impairment charge of million on the mortgage servicing rights and the increase of  in amortization of mortgage servicing rights primarily due to the material decline in long term mortgage rates during the month of december  which caused an increase in prepayment assumptions 
the decline is was offset by a  increase in mortgage servicing fees resulting from a million increase in the portfolio of mortgage loans serviced for 
table of contents others and gains from sale of mortgage loans  which increased million in from the interest rate environment that produces increased mortgage origination activity also typically causes increases in mortgage servicing rights amortization and impairment  creating somewhat of a natural hedge in the mortgage banking line of business 
the  of growth in over was primarily attributable to a  increase in mortgage servicing fees resulting from a million increase in the portfolio of mortgage loans serviced for others and gains from sale of mortgage loans  which increased  in from the balance of the impairment allowance stands at million at the end of see note to the financial statements 
insurance and investment commission income increased by  or in  primarily due to increases in revenue from employee benefits and property and casualty commissions in these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in contingent commission 
insurance and investment commission income increased by  or in  primarily due to the february acquisition of hhws located in bowling green  ohio 
commission income associated with that agency acquisition totaled million in insurance commissions also were favorably impacted by an  increase in contingent commission income in  if you include the contingent commission received by the hhws agency  which is included in their million commissions 
contingent commissions are bonus payments received by first defiance s insurance subsidiary for effective underwriting

concentrations of credit risk financial institutions such as first defiance generate income primarily through lending and investing activities 
the risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment agreement 
this possibility is known as credit risk 
lending or investing activities that concentrate assets in a way that exposes the company to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of occurrences increases credit risk 
diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one manner a financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk 
examples of asset concentrations would include multiple loans made to a single borrower and loans of inappropriate size relative to the total capitalization of the institution 
management believes adherence to its loan and investment policies allows it to control its exposure to concentrations of credit risk at acceptable levels 
first defiance s loan portfolio is concentrated geographically in its northwest ohio  northeast indiana  and southeastern michigan market areas 
management has also identified lending for income generating rental properties as an industry concentration 
total loans for income generating property totaled million at december   which represents of the company s loan portfolio 
management believes it has the skill and experience to manage any risks associated with this type of lending 
loans in this category are generally paying as agreed without any unusual or unexpected levels of delinquency 
the delinquency rate in this category  which is any loan days or more past due  was at december  there are no other industry concentrations that exceed of the company s loan portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through first federal s branch network  along with wholesale sources of funding and its capital base

critical accounting policies first defiance has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of its financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of first defiance are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of first defiance 
allowance for loan losses first defiance believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
in determining the appropriate estimate for the allowance for loan losses  management considers a number of factors relative to both specific credits in the loan portfolio and macro economic factors relative to the economy of the united states as a whole and the economy of the northwest ohio  northeast indiana and southeast michigan regions in which the company does business 

table of contents factors relative to specific credits that are considered include a customer s payment history  a customer s recent financial performance  an assessment of the value of collateral held  knowledge of the customer s character  the financial strength and commitment of any guarantors  the existence of any customer or industry concentrations  changes in a customer s competitive environment  and any other issues that may impact a customer s ability to meet his obligations 
economic factors that are considered include levels of unemployment and inflation  specific plant or business closings in the company s market area  the impact of strikes or other work stoppages  the impact of weather or environmental conditions  especially relative to agricultural borrowers and other matters that may have an impact on the economy as a whole 
in addition to the identification of specific customers who may be potential credit problems  management considers its historical losses  the results of independent loan reviews  an assessment of the adherence to underwriting standards  the loss experience being reported by other financial institutions operating in the company s market area  and other factors in providing for loan losses that have not been specifically classified 
while management believes its allowance for loan losses is conservatively determined based on the above factors  it does not believe the allowances to be excessive or unnecessary 
refer to the section titled allowance for loan losses and note  statement of accounting policies for a further description of the company s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights first defiance believes the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
first defiance recognizes as separate assets the value of mortgage servicing rights  which are acquired through loan origination activities 
first defiance does not purchase any mortgage servicing rights 
key assumptions made by management relative to the valuation of mortgage servicing rights include the stratification policy used in valuing servicing  assumptions relative to future prepayments of mortgages  the potential value of any escrow deposits maintained or ancillary income received as a result of the servicing activity and discount rates used to value the present value of a future cash flow stream 
in assessing the value of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio  management utilizes a third party that specializes in valuing servicing portfolios 
that third party reviews key assumptions with management prior to completing the valuation 
prepayment speeds are determined based on projected median prepayment speeds for and year mortgage backed securities 
those speeds are then adjusted up or down based on the size of the loan 
the discount rate used in this analysis is the pretax yield generally required by purchasers of bulk servicing rights as of the valuation date 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is especially vulnerable in a falling interest rate environment 
refer also to the section entitled mortgage servicing rights and note statement of accounting policies  and note mortgage banking  for a further description of first defiance s valuation process  methodology and assumptions along with sensitivity analyses 
valuation of securities first defiance believes the valuation of certain securities is a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
this is pertaining to the company s investment in certain trust preferred debt obligations securities cdos 
as required by sfas  when a decline in fair value below cost is deemed to be other than temporary  the unrealized loss must be recognized as a charge to earnings 
the fair value of these cdos  which are backed by trust preferred securities issued by banks  thrifts and insurance companies  have a fair value of million 
the market for these securities at december  is not active and markets for similar securities are also not active 
the inactivity was evidenced first by a significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets in which cdos trade and then by a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels 
the new issue market is also inactive as no new cdos have been issued since there are currently very few market participants who are willing and or able to transact for these securities 

table of contents the market values for these securities and any securities other than those issued or guaranteed by the us treasury are very depressed relative to historical levels 
thus in today s market  a low market price for a particular bond may only provide evidence of stress in the credit markets in general versus being an indicator of credit problems with a particular issue 
given the conditions in the debt markets today and the absence of observable transactions in the secondary and new issue markets  management has determined the few observable transactions and market quotations that are available are not reliable for purposed of determining fair value at december   an income valuation approach technique present value technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of observable inputs will be equally or more representative of fair value than the market approach valuation used at the prior measurement dates and the company s cdos will be classified within level of the fair value hierarchy because management determined that significant adjustments were required to determine fair value at the measurement date 
the company s cdo valuations were prepared by an independent third party 
their approach to determining fair value involved several steps detailed credit and structural evaluation of each piece of collateral in the cdo  collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in the cdo default  recovery and prepayment amortization probabilities and discounted cash flow modeling 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management a significant portion of the company s revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  the company strives to manage its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of the company s performance due to changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
first defiance does not presently use off balance sheet derivatives to enhance its risk management 
first defiance monitors interest rate risk on a monthly basis through simulation analysis that measures the impact changes in interest rates can have on net interest income 
the simulation technique analyzes the effect of a presumed basis point shift in interest rates which is consistent with management s estimate of the range of potential interest rate fluctuations and takes into account prepayment speeds on amortizing financial instruments  loan and deposit volumes and rates  non maturity deposit assumptions and capital requirements 
the results of the simulation indicate that in an environment where interest rates rise basis points over a month period  first defiance s net interest income would increase by just over the base case scenario 
it should be noted that other areas of first defiance s income statement  such as gains from sales of mortgage loans and amortization of mortgage servicing rights are also impacted by fluctuations in interest rates but are not considered in the simulation of net interest income 
the majority of first defiance s lending activities are in non residential real estate and commercial loan areas 
while such loans carry higher credit risk than residential mortgage lending  they tend to be more rate sensitive than residential mortgage loans 
the balance of first defiance s non residential and multi family real estate loan portfolio was million  which was split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  the commercial loan portfolio increased to million  which is split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  certain of the loans classified as adjustable have fixed rates for an initial term that may be as long as five years 

table of contents the maturities on fixed rate loans are generally less than years 
first defiance also has significant balances of home equity and improvement loans million at december   of which million fluctuate with changes in the prime lending rate 
approximately million of home equity and improvement loans have fixed rates but the maturities on those loans range from three to five years 
first defiance also has consumer loans million at december  which tend to have a shorter duration than residential mortgage loans 
also  to limit its interest rate risk  as well as to provide liquidity first federal sells a majority of its fixed rate mortgage originations into the secondary market 
in addition to the simulation analysis  first federal also prepares an economic value of equity eve analysis 
this analysis calculates the net present value of first federal s assets and liabilities in rate shock environments that range from basis points to basis points 
the likelihood of a decrease in interest rates as of december  was considered to be remote given the current interest rate levels and therefore  was not included in this analysis 
the results of this analysis are reflected in the following table 
december  economic value of equity economic value of equity as of present value of assets change in rates amount change change ratio change dollars in thousands bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  based on the above analysis  in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates as of december   first federal would experience a decrease in its economic value of equity 
during periods of rising rates  the value of monetary assets declines 
conversely  during periods of falling rates  the value of monetary assets increases 
it should be noted that the amount of change in value of specific assets and liabilities due to changes in rates is not the same in a rising rate environment as in a falling rate environment 
based on the eve analysis  the change in the economic value of equity in both rising and falling rate environments is relatively low because both its assets and liabilities have relatively short durations and the durations are fairly closely matched 
the average duration of its assets at december  was years while the average duration of its liabilities was years 
in evaluating first federal s exposure to interest rate risk  certain shortcomings inherent in each of the methods of analysis presented must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates while interest rates on other types of financial instruments may lag behind current changes in market rates 
furthermore  in the event of changes in rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels could differ significantly from the assumptions in calculating the table and the results therefore may differ from those presented
