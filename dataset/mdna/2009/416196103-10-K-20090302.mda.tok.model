in  our shoppers segment had revenues of million  which represented of our total revenue 
at december   our shoppers were zoned into more than  separate editions with total circulation of over million in california and florida each week 
as a result of the difficult economic environment in california and florida  we curtailed more than million of unprofitable or marginal circulation from july to february of this consisted of approximately  of circulation in california and  of circulation in florida 
after the february circulation curtailment  our shoppers circulation will still reach approximately million addresses each week 
we continue to evaluate all of our circulation performance and may make further circulation reductions in the future as part of our efforts to address the difficult economic conditions in california and florida 
we derive revenues from the sale of direct marketing services and shopper advertising services 
as a worldwide business  direct marketing is affected by general national and international economic trends 
direct marketing revenues are also affected by economic fundamentals of each industry that we serve  various market factors  including the demand for services by our clients  and the financial condition of and budgets available to specific clients  among other factors 
our shoppers operate in regional markets in california and florida and are largely affected by the strength of the local economies 
our principal operating expense items are labor  postage and transportation 
during the fourth quarter of  our businesses continued to face challenging economic environments  which negatively impacted our financial performance 
marketing budgets are often more discretionary in nature and easier to reduce in the short term than other expenses in response to weak economic conditions 
difficult economic conditions may also result in reduced demand for our products and services due to consolidation or  in some cases  bankruptcies of customers and prospective customers in the industry verticals that we serve  and these economic conditions may result in collection difficulties and bankruptcy preference actions to recover certain amounts previously paid to us by our clients 
revenues from our shoppers business are largely dependent on local advertising expenditures in the california and florida geographies in which we operate 
such expenditures are substantially affected by the strength of the local economies in those markets 
during the fourth quarter of  the negative trends and economic conditions that we have seen throughout in california and florida continued and deteriorated 
these conditions were initially created by weakness in the real estate and associated financing markets and have spread across virtually all categories 
direct marketing revenues are dependent on  among other things  national  regional and international economies and business conditions 
during the fourth quarter of  the ongoing economic downturn in the united states and other economies continued to adversely impact the marketing expenditures and activities of our customers 
what began in prior quarters as caution with spending plans became even more pronounced throughout the fourth quarter  resulting in significant reductions and delays in spending by clients in the face of extreme economic uncertainty

index to financial statements given the external environment  we face an uncertain revenue outlook for  and believe that our financial performance will continue to be negatively impacted 
as a result  we have taken actions  and plan to take further actions  designed to align our expense base and structure to the external economic environment facing our businesses 
these actions have included further head count reductions  consolidating businesses and closing facilities  reductions of marginal shoppers circulation  wage freezes  wage reductions including salary reductions for all harte hanks  inc officers  tighter management of capital spending  non client travel restrictions and enhanced controls around accounts receivable and collections 
nevertheless  we cannot predict the impact of future economic conditions or the ultimate effectiveness and expenses associated with our efforts to address those economic conditions

in  our high tech telecom and select markets verticals both experienced double digit revenue growth 
high tech telecom results were primarily driven by the acquisition of mason zimbler in january of and increases in various services to an existing high tech client 
the select markets increase was due increased revenues from the automotive segment

the acquisition of mason zimbler also contributed to the increase in operating expenses in compared to direct marketing s largest cost components are labor and transportation costs

as a result of the negative economic trends in the second half of  we have taken actions to adjust our expense base to reduced revenue levels 
these actions  which will continue into the first quarter of  include headcount reductions  wage freezes and wage reductions 
we anticipate recording approximately million in severance costs in the first quarter of associated with these actions  and expect to realize a positive impact on our labor costs as a result of these actions 
fuel costs have increased significantly in the last few years and were at historically high levels throughout much of before decreasing significantly in the fourth quarter of future changes in fuel costs will continue to impact direct marketing s total production costs and total operating expenses

index to financial statements share repurchase during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million under our stock repurchase program  all of which was purchased during the first quarter of as of december   we have repurchased million shares since the beginning of our january stock repurchase program 
in january  our board authorized an additional million shares under our stock repurchase program  bringing the total repurchase authorization to million shares 
under this program  we had authorization to repurchase approximately million additional shares at december  outlook we consider such factors as current assets  current liabilities  total debt  revenues  operating income and cash flows from operations  investing activities and financing activities when assessing our liquidity 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from operating activities 
our management of cash is designed to optimize returns on cash balances and to ensure that it is readily available to meet our operating  investing and financing requirements as they arise 
capital resources are also available from and provided through our revolving credit facility  subject to the terms and conditions of that facility 
the amount of cash on hand and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility are influenced by a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  revenue growth  accounts receivable collections  working capital changes  capital expenditures  tax payments  share repurchases  acquisitions and dividends 
recent developments in the financial markets have increased our exposure to the possible liquidity and credit risks of counterparties to our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million of unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and we have not experienced any limitations to date on our ability to access this source of liquidity 
based on our current operational plans  we believe that our revolving credit facility  together with cash provided by operating activities  will be sufficient to fund operations  anticipated capital expenditures  contributions to our pension plans  payments of principal and interest on our borrowings  and dividends on our common stock for at least the next twelve months 
nevertheless  we cannot predict the impact on our business performance of the ongoing economic downturn in the united states and other economies 
a lasting economic downturn or recession in the united states and other economies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or operating results 
our revolving credit facility matures in august if the ongoing disruptions in the credit markets continue for an extended period of time  we may be unable to obtain a replacement facility on acceptable terms or at all  or we may be unable to access funds under our revolving credit facility because of counterparty risk or other factors 
in that event  depending on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  our overall liquidity and ability to make payments on our indebtedness under our term loan facility which matures in september and our term loan facility which matures in march may be adversely impacted  and we may be required to seek one or more alternatives  such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness  selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise debt or equity capital 
we cannot assure you that any of these actions could be affected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all 
in addition  our existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants which may prohibit us from adopting one or more of these alternatives 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that  in our judgment  are most important to the portrayal of our company s financial condition and results of operations and which require complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
the areas that we believe involve the most significant management estimates and assumptions are detailed below 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
historically  actual results have not differed significantly from our estimates

index to financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectibility is reasonably assured  and iv the service has been performed or the product has been delivered 
payments received in advance of the performance of services or delivery of the product are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as the services are performed or the product is delivered 
our accounting policy for revenue recognition has an impact on our reported results and relies on certain estimates that require judgments on the part of management 
the portion of our revenue that is most subject to estimates and judgments is revenue recognized using the proportional performance method  as discussed below 
direct marketing revenue is derived from a variety of services and products  and may be billed at hourly rates  monthly rates or a fixed price 
for all sales  we require either a purchase order  a statement of work signed by the client  a written contract  or some other form of written authorization from the client 
revenue from database design and development  market research  agency services  analytical services  and creative are typically billed based on time and materials or at a fixed price 
if billed at a fixed price  revenue is recognized on a proportional performance basis as the services specified in the arrangement are performed 
in most cases  proportional performance is based on the ratio of direct costs incurred to total estimated costs where the costs incurred  primarily labor hours and outsourced services  represent a reasonable surrogate for output measures or contract performance 
progress on a contract is matched against project costs and costs to complete on a periodic basis 
provision for estimated contract losses  if any  is made in the period such losses are determined 
management estimates and judgments are used in connection with determining the revenue recognized in these instances 
should actual costs differ significantly from the original estimated costs  the timing of revenues and overall profitability of the contract could be impacted 
for fixed fee market research revenue streams  revenue is recognized in proportion to the value of service provided based on output criteria 
contracts accounted for under the proportional performance method constituted less than of total direct marketing revenue and less than of our total revenue for the years ended december   and revenue from technology database subscriptions is based on a fixed price and is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
revenue from database and website hosting services is recognized ratably over the contractual hosting period  and pricing is typically based on a fixed price per month or price per contract

revenue from software is recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop software revenue recognition  as amended by sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition 
sop generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the vendor specific objective evidence of fair values of the respective elements 
for software sales with multiple elements for example  software licenses with undelivered post contract customer support or pcs  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
this means we defer revenue from the software sale equal to the fair value of the undelivered 
table of contents 
index to financial statements elements 
the fair value of pcs is based upon separate sales of renewals to other clients 
the fair value of services  such as training and consulting  is based upon separate sales of these services to other clients 
the revenue allocated to pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the support period 
revenue allocated to professional services is recognized as the services are performed 
the revenue allocated to software products  including time based software licenses  is recognized  if collection is probable  upon execution of a licensing agreement and shipment of the software or ratably over the term of the license  depending on the structure and terms of the arrangement 
if the licensing agreement is for a term of one year or less and includes pcs  we recognize the software and the pcs revenue ratably over the term of the license 
we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware to our hosted software service transactions 
for certain non software arrangements  we enter into contracts that include delivery of a combination of two or more of our service offerings 
typically  such multiple element arrangements incorporate the design and development of data management tools or systems and an ongoing obligation to manage  host or otherwise run solutions for our customer 
such arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting  provided that the delivered item has stand alone value and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their fair values and to the initial delivered elements using the residual method 
revenue from these services is recognized separately  and in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  for each element 
as described above  sometimes our customer arrangements have multiple deliverables  including service elements 
generally  our multiple element arrangements fall within the scope of specific accounting standards that provide guidance regarding the separation of elements in multiple deliverable arrangements and the allocation of consideration among those elements eg  aicpa sop software revenue recognition 
if not  we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the provisions of eitf require us to unbundle multiple element arrangements into separate units of accounting when the delivered element s has stand alone value and objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element s exist s 
when we are able to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the accounting policies described above to each unit 
if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the accounting policies described above to the entire arrangement 
this might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized from the arrangement 
shopper services are considered rendered  and the revenue recognized  when all printing  sorting  labeling and ancillary services have been provided and the mailing material has been received by the usps 
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not reflected in our revenues or expenses 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain our allowance for doubtful accounts at a balance adequate to reduce accounts receivable to the amount of cash expected to be realized upon collection 
the methodology used to determine the minimum allowance balance is based on our prior collection experience and is generally related to the accounts receivable balance in various aging categories 
the balance is also influenced by specific clients financial strength and circumstance 
accounts that are determined to be uncollectible are written off in the period in which they are determined to be uncollectible 
periodic changes to the allowance balance are recorded as increases or decreases to bad debt expense  which is included in the advertising  selling  general and administrative line of our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded bad debt expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
while we believe our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements reserve estimate to be appropriate  we may find it necessary to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if future bad debt expense exceeds the estimated reserve 
current economic conditions increase the difficulty and level of management judgement in setting the reserve 
given the significance of accounts receivable to the consolidated financial statements  the determination of net realizable values is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
reserve for healthcare  workers compensation  automobile and general liability we are self insured for our workers compensation  automobile  general liability and a portion of our healthcare insurance 
we make various subjective judgments about a number of factors in determining our reserve for healthcare  workers compensation  automobile and general liability insurance  and the related expense 
our deductible for individual healthcare claims is million 
our deductible for workers compensation is million 
we have a million deductible for automobile and general liability claims 
our insurance administrator provides us with estimated loss reserves  based upon its experience dealing with similar types of claims  as well as amounts paid to date against these claims 
we apply actuarial factors to both insurance estimated loss reserves and to paid claims and then determine reserve levels  taking into account these calculations 
if ultimate losses were higher than our estimate at december   net income would be impacted by approximately million  net of taxes 
the amount that earnings would be impacted is dependent on the claim year and our deductible levels for that plan year 
periodic changes to the reserve for workers compensation  automobile and general liability are recorded as increases or decreases to insurance expense  which is included in the advertising  selling  general and administrative line of our consolidated statement of operations 
periodic changes to the reserve for healthcare are recorded as increases or decreases to employee benefits expense  which is included in the labor line of our consolidated statement of operations 
goodwill goodwill is recorded to the extent that the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is periodically tested for impairment 
we assess the impairment of our goodwill in accordance with sfas  by determining the fair value of each of our reporting units and comparing the fair value to the carrying value for each reporting unit 
we have identified our reporting units as direct marketing and shoppers 
as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units  estimated fair value is determined using projected discounted future cash flows based on historical performance and management s estimate of future performance  giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions 
cash flow multiple models and our overall market capitalization are also considered when evaluating the fair value of our reporting units 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  we must calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities recognized and unrecognized in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  and then compare this implied fair value to its carrying amount 
to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded 
both the direct marketing and shoppers segments were tested for impairment using november as our valuation date 
we have not recorded an impairment loss in any of the three years ended december  significant estimates utilized in our discounted cash flow model include weighted average cost of capital and the long term rate of growth for each of our reporting segments 
these estimates require management s judgment 
any significant changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects  or changes in market conditions  could have an impact on this annual analysis 
at december  and  our goodwill balance was million and million  respectively 
based upon our analysis  the estimated fair values of our reporting units as of december  were in excess of the reporting units carrying values

index to financial statements stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of share based awards requires judgment  including in some cases estimating expected term  volatility and dividend yield 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from some of these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded total stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively 
new accounting pronouncements as discussed in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements  certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future 
our adoption of sfas r  business combinations  in will affect the way we account for acquisitions  including acquisition related costs  contingencies and contingent consideration  and may also impact the amount of information we disclose about acquisitions 
the adoption of the remaining new accounting pronouncements discussed in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements have not and are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we face market risks related to interest rate variations and to foreign exchange rate variations 
from time to time  we may utilize derivative financial instruments as described below to manage our exposure to such risks 
we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related to our credit facilities 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our credit facilities  which bear interest at variable rates based on eurodollar rates effective day rate of at december  
the five year million revolving credit facility has a maturity date of august  at december   we did not have any debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the five year million term loan facility has a maturity date of september  at december   our debt balance related to the term loan facility was million 
the four year term loan facility has a maturity date of march  at december   our debt balance related to the term loan facility was million 
in september  we entered into a two year interest rate swap with a notional amount of million and a fixed rate of in order to limit a portion of our interest rate exposure by converting a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
assuming the actual level of borrowing throughout  and assuming a one percentage point change in the year s average interest rates  it is estimated that our net income would have changed by approximately million 
due to our interest rate swap  overall debt level at december   anticipated cash flows from operations  and the various financial alternatives available to management should there be an adverse change in interest rates  we do not believe that we currently have significant exposure to market risks associated with changing interest rates 
our earnings are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our operations in foreign countries 
our primary exchange rate exposure is to the euro  british pound sterling  australian dollar  philippine peso and brazilian real 
we monitor these risks throughout the normal course of business 
the majority of the transactions of our us and foreign operations are denominated in the respective local 
table of contents 
index to financial statements currencies 
changes in exchange rates related to these types of transactions are reflected in the applicable line items making up operating income in our statement of operations 
due to the current level of operations conducted in foreign currencies  we do not believe that the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on these types of transactions is significant to our overall annual earnings 
a smaller portion of our transactions are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currencies 
for example  inter company transactions that are expected to be settled in the near term are denominated in us dollars 
since the accounting records of our foreign operations are kept in the respective local currency  any transactions denominated in other currencies are accounted for in the respective local currency at the time of the transaction 
upon settlement of such a transaction  any foreign currency gain or loss results in an adjustment to income  which is recorded in other  net in our statement of operations 
transactions such as these amounted to million in pre tax currency transaction losses in at this time we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging 
we do not speculate using derivative instruments
