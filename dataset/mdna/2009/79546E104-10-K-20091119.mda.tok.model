table of contents overview description of business we are the largest distributor of professional beauty supplies in the us based on store count 
we operate primarily through two business units  sally beauty supply and bsg 
through sally beauty supply and bsg which operates stores under the cosmoprof service mark  we operated a multi channel platform of  stores and supplied franchised stores in north america  south america and selected european countries  as of september  within bsg  we also have one of the largest networks of professional distributor sales consultants in north america  with approximately  professional distributor sales consultants who sell directly to salons and salon professionals 
we provide our customers with a wide variety of leading third party branded and exclusive label professional beauty supplies  including hair care products  styling appliances  skin and nail care products and other beauty items 
sally beauty supply stores target retail consumers and salon professionals  while bsg exclusively targets salons and salon professionals 
for the year ended september   our consolidated net sales and operating earnings were  million and million  respectively 
we believe sally beauty supply is the largest open line distributor of professional beauty supplies in the us based on store count 
as of september   sally beauty supply operated  company operated retail stores   of which are located in the us with the remainder in the united kingdom and certain other countries in europe  canada  puerto rico  mexico and chile and supplied franchised stores all outside the us sally beauty supply stores in the us range in size between  square feet and  square feet and are primarily located in strip shopping centers 
the product selection in sally beauty supply stores ranges between  and  skus of beauty products and includes products for hair care  skin and nail care  beauty sundries and electrical appliances targeting retail consumers and salon professionals 
sally beauty supply stores carry leading third party brands such as clairol  revlon and conair  as well as an extensive selection of exclusive label merchandise 
for the year ended september   sally beauty supply s net sales and segment operating earnings were  million and million  respectively  representing and of our consolidated net sales and operating profit before unallocated corporate expenses  respectively 
we believe bsg is the largest full service distributor of professional beauty supplies in the us as of september   bsg had company operated stores  supplied franchised stores and had a sales force of approximately  professional distributor sales consultants selling exclusively to salons and salon professionals in substantially all states in the us and in portions of canada  puerto rico  mexico and certain european countries 
bsg stores average approximately  square feet and are primarily located in secondary strip shopping centers 
through bsg s large store base and sales force  bsg is able to access a significant portion of the highly fragmented us salon channel 
the product selection in bsg stores  ranging between  and  skus of beauty products  includes hair care and color  skin and nail care  beauty sundries and electrical appliances  targeting salons and salon professionals 
bsg carries leading professional beauty product brands  intended for use in salons and for resale by the salon to consumers 
certain bsg products are sold under exclusive distribution agreements with suppliers  whereby bsg is designated as the sole distributor for a product line within certain geographic territories 
for the year ended september   bsg s net sales and segment operating profit were million and million  respectively  representing and of our consolidated net sales and operating profit before unallocated corporate expenses  respectively 
industry and business trends we operate within the large and growing us professional beauty supply industry 
potential growth in the industry is expected to be driven by increases in hair color  hair loss prevention and hair styling products  offset by lower sales of electrical products during periods of prolonged economic slowdown 
we believe the 
table of contents following key industry and business trends and characteristics will influence our business and our financial results going forward high level of marketplace fragmentation 
the us salon channel is highly fragmented with over  salons 
given the fragmented and small scale nature of the salon industry  we believe that salon operators will continue to depend on full service exclusive distributors and open line channels for a majority of their beauty supply purchases 
growth in booth renting and frequent stocking needs 
salon professionals primarily rely on just in time inventory due to capital constraints and a lack of warehouse and shelf space at salons 
in addition  booth renters  who comprise a significant percentage of total us salon professionals  are often responsible for purchasing their own supplies 
historically  booth renters have significantly increased as a percentage of total salon professionals  and we expect this trend to continue 
given their smaller individual purchases and relative lack of financial resources  booth renters are likely to be dependent on frequent trips to professional beauty supply stores  like bsg and sally beauty supply 
these factors continue to drive demand for conveniently located professional beauty supply stores 
increasing use of exclusive label products 
we offer a broad range of private label and control label products  which we generally refer to collectively as exclusive label products 
private label products are brands for which we own or license the trademark and  in some instances  the formula 
control label products are brands that are owned by the manufacturer  but for which we have been granted sole distribution rights 
generally  our exclusive label products have higher gross margins than the leading third party branded products  and we believe this area offers potential growth 
please see risk factors we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
favorable demographic and consumer trends 
the aging baby boomer population is expected to drive future growth in professional beauty supply sales through an increase in the usage of hair color and hair loss products 
additionally  continuously changing fashion related trends that drive new hair styles are expected to result in continued demand for hair styling products 
changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends can have an impact on our financial performance 
our continued success depends in large part on our ability to anticipate  gauge and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences for beauty products 
we continuously adapt our marketing and merchandising initiatives for sally beauty supply in an effort to expand our market reach or to respond to changing consumer preferences 
if we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the marketplace for beauty products and changing consumer demands  our business could suffer 
international growth strategies 
a key element of our growth strategy depends on our ability to capitalize on growth in the international marketplace and to grow our current level of non us operations 
for example  on september   we acquired distribuidora intersalon limitada  a leading distributor of premier beauty supply products with stores located in chile and  in may of  we acquired pro duo  nv  a cash and carry retailer of both professional and retail hair products with stores located mainly in belgium  france and spain 
in addition  in february of  we acquired chapelton limited  a private company based in scotland with almost stores located in the united kingdom  ireland  germany  and spain 
these acquisitions furthered our expansion plans in europe  a significant part of sally beauty supply s international growth initiative 
we intend to continue to identify and evaluate non us acquisition targets 
our ability to grow our non us operations  integrate our new non us acquisitions and successfully pursue additional non us acquisitions may be affected by business  legal  regulatory and economic risks 
please see risk factors we may not be able to successfully identify acquisition candidates and complete desirable acquisitions  if we acquire any businesses in the future they could prove 
table of contents difficult to integrate  disrupt our business or have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to conduct business in international marketplaces may be affected by legal  regulatory and economic risks 
continuing consolidation 
there is continuing consolidation among professional beauty product distributors and professional beauty product manufacturers 
we plan to continue to examine ways in which we can benefit from this trend  including reviewing opportunities to shift business from competitive distributors to the bsg network as well as seeking opportunistic  value added acquisitions which complement our long term growth strategy 
we believe that suppliers are increasingly likely to focus on larger distributors and retailers with a broader scale and retail footprint 
we also believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend as well as participate in the ongoing consolidation at the distributor retail level 
however  changes often occur in our relationships with suppliers that may materially affect the net sales and operating earnings of our business segments 
consolidation among suppliers could exacerbate the effects of these relationship changes and could increase pricing pressures 
for example  as we announced in december  our largest supplier  l oreal  moved a material amount of revenue out of the bsg nationwide distribution network and into competitive regional distribution networks 
more recently  l oreal acquired distributors competing with bsg in the southeastern and west coast of the us and a supplier that does not currently do business with bsg 
as a result  l oreal directly competes with bsg in certain geographic areas 
if l oreal acquired other distributors or suppliers that conduct significant business with bsg  we could lose related revenue 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further loss of revenue over time by bsg including within its franchise based business due to potential losses of additional products both from l oreal and from other suppliers as well as from the increased competition from l oreal affiliated distribution networks 
please see risk factors the beauty products distribution industry is highly competitive and is consolidating and we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
relationships with suppliers 
sally beauty supply bsg and their suppliers are dependent on each other for the distribution of beauty products 
we do not manufacture the brand name or exclusive label products we sell 
we purchase our products from a limited number of manufacturers 
as is typical in distribution businesses  these relationships are subject to change from time to time including the expansion or loss of distribution rights in various geographies and the addition or loss of product lines 
since we purchase products from many manufacturers on an at will basis  under contracts which can generally be terminated without cause upon days notice or less or which expire without express rights of renewal  such manufacturers could discontinue sales to us at any time or upon the expiration of the distribution period 
some of our contracts with manufacturers may be terminated by such manufacturers if we fail to meet specified minimum purchase requirements 
in such cases  we do not have contractual assurances of continued supply  pricing or access to new products and vendors may change the terms upon which they sell 
infrequently  a supplier will seek to terminate a distribution relationship through legal action 
changes in our relationships with suppliers occur often and could positively or negatively impact our net sales and operating profits 
although we focus on developing new revenue and cost management initiatives to mitigate the negative effects resulting from unfavorable changes in our supplier relationships  there can be no assurance that our efforts will continue to completely offset the loss of these or other distribution rights 
please see risk factors we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
we expect to continue to expand our product line offerings and to gain additional distribution rights over time through either further negotiation with suppliers or by strategic acquisitions of existing distributors 
although we are focused on developing new revenue and cost management 
table of contents initiatives  there can be no assurance that our efforts will partially or completely offset any potential loss of distribution rights in the future 
please see risk factors we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
high level of competition 
sally beauty supply competes with other domestic and international beauty product wholesale and retail outlets  including local and regional open line beauty supply stores  professional only beauty supply stores  salons  mass merchandisers  drug stores and supermarkets  as well as sellers on the internet and salons retailing hair care items 
bsg competes with other domestic and international beauty product wholesale and retail suppliers and manufacturers selling professional beauty products directly to salons and individual salon professionals 
we also face competition from authorized and unauthorized retailers and internet sites offering professional salon only products 
the increasing availability of unauthorized professional salon products in large format retail stores such as drug stores  grocery stores and others could also have a negative impact on our business 
please see risk factors the beauty products distribution industry is highly competitive and is consolidating 
economic conditions 
we appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer a broad selection of beauty products sold directly to retail consumers and salons and salon professionals 
historically  these factors have provided us with reduced exposure to downturns in economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
however  a continued downturn in the economy  especially for an extended period of time  could adversely impact consumer demand of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services  particularly affecting our electrical products category and our full service sales business 
in addition  higher freight costs resulting from increases in the cost of fuel  especially for an extended period of time  may impact our expenses at levels that we cannot pass through to our customers 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
please see risk factors a further downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
controlling expenses 
another important aspect of our business is our ability to control costs  especially in our bsg business segment  by right sizing the business and maximizing the efficiency of our structure 
in late fiscal year  we began implementing an approximately million capital spending program to consolidate warehouses and reduce administrative expenses related to bsg s distribution network optimization program 
we estimate that this program resulted in cost savings of approximately million in the fiscal year and believe that annualized cost savings from this program could approximate million beginning in fiscal year please see risk factors we are not certain that our ongoing cost control plans will continue to be successful 
opening new stores 
our future growth strategy depends in part on our ability to open and profitably operate new stores in existing and additional geographic areas 
the capital requirements to open a us based sally beauty supply or bsg store  excluding inventory  average approximately  and  respectively  with the capital requirements for international stores costing less or substantially more depending upon the marketplace 
however  in response to economic conditions and to allow flexibility to capitalize on potential real estate revaluations in key locations  we have slowed our new store openings 
we may not be able to open all of the new stores we plan to open and any new stores we open may not be profitable  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
please see risk factors if we are unable to profitably open and operate new stores  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

table of contents changes to our information technology systems 
as our operations grow in both size and scope  we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our information systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 
the expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial  operational and technical resources in advance of any increase in the volume of our business  with no assurance that the volume of business will increase 
for example  in fiscal year  we began upgrading our distribution information systems in connection with our capital spending program to consolidate warehouses  as discussed above  upgrading our as iseries servers and installing hyperion software to enhance our financial reporting system 
these and any other required upgrades to our information systems and information technology or new technology  now or in the future  will require that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist in completion of these projects 
there can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades  service outages or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology and customer issues therewith  or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our financial reporting  business  financial condition or results of operations 
please see risk factors we may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems

our separation from alberto culver our business historically constituted two operating segments within the consolidated financial statements of alberto culver 
on november   we separated from alberto culver  pursuant to the investment agreement 
as a result i we own and operate the sally beauty supply and bsg distribution businesses that were owned and operated by alberto culver prior to the separation transactions  ii at the closing of the separation transactions  the stockholders of alberto culver prior thereto became the beneficial owners of approximately of our outstanding common stock on an undiluted basis and the cdr investors  who in the aggregate invested million in us  received an equity interest representing approximately of our outstanding common stock on an undiluted basis  and iii alberto culver continued to own and operate its consumer products business 
in addition  in connection with the separation transactions  the company  through subsidiaries sally investment holdings llc sally investment and sally holdings  incurred approximately  million of indebtedness 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report 
prior to november   the company was a subsidiary of alberto culver and had no share based compensation plans of its own  however  certain employees of the company had been granted stock options and stock awards under share based compensation plans of alberto culver 
alberto culver treated the separation transactions as though they constituted a change in control for purposes of alberto culver s stock options and stock awards 
as a result  in accordance with the terms of these plans  all outstanding stock options and restricted shares of alberto culver  including those held by our employees  became fully vested upon completion of the separation transactions 
due to the separation transactions  during the fiscal year  we recorded a charge of approximately million  which represents the amount of future compensation expense that would have been recognized in subsequent periods as the stock options and restricted shares for our employees vested over the original vesting periods 
upon completion of the separation transactions  all outstanding alberto culver stock options held by our employees became options to purchase shares of our common stock 
credit facilities the term loans and the abl facility are secured by substantially all of our assets  those of sally investment  those of our domestic subsidiaries and  in the case of the abl facility  those of our canadian subsidiaries 
the term loans may be prepaid at our option at any time without premium or penalty 
such facility is subject to mandatory prepayment in an amount equal to of excess cash flow as defined in the agreement governing the term loans for any fiscal year unless a specified leverage ratio is met

total a represents pre acquisition debt of pro duo  nv other significant items interest rate swap agreements the company  though sally holdings  utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage its cash flow risk associated with changing interest rates as it relates to its term loans 
we do not currently purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the counterparties are deemed to be of substantial resources and strong creditworthiness 
however  these transactions do result in exposure to credit risks in the event of default by a counterparty 
the recent financial crisis affecting the banking systems and financial markets resulted in many well known financial institutions becoming less creditworthy or having diminished liquidity and  thus  we could be exposed to an increased level of counterparty risk 
in the event that a counterparty defaults in its obligation under our interest rate swaps  we could incur substantial financial loss 
at september   the aggregate fair market value of all our interest rate swaps was a liability of million 
in november of  sally holdings entered into four interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million 
interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million expired in november of and interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million will expire in november of these interest rate swap agreements do not currently qualify as hedges and  therefore  the change in fair value of these interest rate swap agreements is recorded in net interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 
additionally  in may of  sally holdings entered into two interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million 
these interest rate swap agreements are designated as effective hedges  consistent with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc accordingly  adjustments to reflect the change in the fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged obligation is settled or the swap agreements expire  whichever is earlier 
any ineffectiveness is recognized in net interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings
