item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis md a will help you understand the financial condition and results of millipore corporation s operations 
the md a is a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
business overview millipore is a global leader in life science 
we provide innovative products  services and solutions that help our academic  biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers advance their research  development and production 
they use our products and services to increase their speed and to improve their consistency  while reducing costs in laboratory applications and in biopharmaceutical manufacturing 
our extensive technical expertise and applications knowledge give us the unique ability to help address research and manufacturing problems 
we engage in peer to peer discussions with scientists to confront challenging human health issues 
we have two operating divisions 
our bioscience division provides innovative products and technologies that improve laboratory productivity and work flows for life science research 
our bioscience division contributed approximately of our revenues 
our bioprocess division helps pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies develop their manufacturing processes  optimize their manufacturing productivity and ensure the quality of their drugs 
it contributed approximately of our revenues 
we provide a wide range of products and services to a variety of customers around the world 
we do not rely on any single business  market or economy  and the breadth of our products and services allows us to target growth on a number of dimensions 
the balance between the products and services sold through our bioprocess and bioscience divisions and our revenues by division logo global market reach allowed us to mitigate some of the sales weakness we experienced in our bioprocess division during while bioprocess revenues declined in  the decline was somewhat offset by the growth of our bioscience division 
we also benefited from faster revenue growth in europe and asia pacific where we have a greater diversification of end markets and customers 
business drivers the primary business driver of our bioscience division is the research activities of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions  governments and other organizations 
demand for our products increases with the amount of research being conducted worldwide 
key market trends affecting the business include the global expansion of laboratories  particularly in asia  the move from genomic based research to protein research and cell biology  and higher demand for workflow based solutions to improve laboratory productivity 
for example  pressure on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to identify new drug candidates has increased demand for our work flow productivity products 
pre validated  optimized products  especially those combined in kits  increase efficiency and save millipore form k 
table of contents part ii key market drivers logo researchers time 
we have expanded the number of new products we offer and have incorporated our lab filtration  reagents and other products into critical laboratory protocols 
we believe customers will pay a premium for our innovative products  technical expertise and streamlined services 
other business drivers of the bioscience division include logo new products and customer work flow solutions 
for example  work flow solutions that include devices  consumable products  and technical service and expertise 
logo an ability to collaborate with customers electronically through the internet and other electronic commerce channels  particularly relating to our life science business 
logo access to life science thought leaders and an ability to license  commercialize and acquire technologies 
the business drivers of our bioprocess division include the demand for  and the corresponding production of  commercial therapeutics such as biologic drugs 
over the past decade  approvals for new biologics and new indications for existing biologics are increasing  particularly for monoclonal antibodies  cell culture based vaccines and other recombinant protein based therapeutics 
as pharmaceutical companies shift more of their drug pipeline from chemically based drugs to biologic drugs  our business will grow if a greater number of these molecules are commercially approved and if we win production process steps for these molecules 
monoclonal antibodies are among the fastest growing biologic drugs 
they are separation intensive  complex to produce and require significant use of our bioprocess products 
demand is increasing because of their ability to treat diseases for which there have been few therapies 
the growth in biologics is also creating increased demand for our consumable products used in their production 
we provide a number of technologies for use in small scale drug production 
they can be reliably scaled up to commercial manufacturing volumes as demand grows 
our expertise in purifying monoclonal antibodies positions us strategically to gain customer access and increase our applications knowledge 
these intimate customer relationships help us identify new technologies and customer needs 
they also help our customers optimize their productivity 
therefore  we typically see our revenues increase from early stage clinical development to late stage clinical development and ultimately upon approval of a specific drug 
this is particularly true during the later stages of the process  like clinical trials and commercial production 
other business drivers of the bioprocess division include logo commercialization of innovative products that increase production speed and productivity  and that reduce risk 
for example  new biologic drug manufacturing platforms that employ disposable manufacturing solutions 
logo changes in the number of manufacturing campaigns or inventory levels at our large biopharmaceutical manufacturing customers 
logo biopharmaceutical manufacturing capacity expansion  particularly in growth markets in asia 
logo increasing customer manufacturing quality standards resulting in the need for more sophisticated process monitoring and quality control 
logo market shifts in the demand for our products 
for example  shifts toward generic and biosimilar drugs as patents on existing drugs expire and toward animal free manufacturing supplements 
logo our customers focus on process optimization to drive efficiency and drug safety

table of contents part ii our strategy our corporate strategy is to selectively focus on the most attractive segments of the life science research and biopharmaceutical manufacturing markets where we can establish market leadership  generate the highest levels of growth  and drive competitive differentiation 
our strategy has been organized around the following objectives strengthen our leadership position with biotechnology manufacturing customers by expanding our bioprocess product offerings establish millipore as a strategic supplier in bioscience research markets by increasing our product breadth and expanding into new markets lead our industry in product quality and manufacturing effectiveness attract  retain and develop talented and motivated employees the strategy of our bioscience division is to capitalize on our global infrastructure and core capabilities in filtration  reagents and assay development to provide differentiated offerings in fast growing market segments 
the division pursues targeted  market specific strategies in laboratory water  drug discovery and life science research 
the strategy of our bioprocess division is to leverage our leading market position and broad product portfolio to offer integrated productivity improvement solutions to biopharmaceutical companies 
we help them increase their speed  lower their costs  minimize their risk and increase their quality 
we believe the division is uniquely capable in these areas 
the division s global sales organization focuses on selling our applications expertise  as well as products and services that enable our customers to move from product centric manufacturing processes to an optimized and integrated work flow approach 
highlights consolidated revenues of  million for increased million  or percent  compared to the revenue increase included a percent favorable effect from changes in foreign currency translation rates 
adjusting for this item  our consolidated revenues for grew percent 
changes in product pricing had an insignificant effect on the year over year comparison 
we made no business acquisitions in in  higher bioscience revenues resulted primarily from sales growth of our laboratory water products and services 
this increase was offset by softness in bioprocess revenues from some of our large biotechnology customers and weakening global economic conditions 
after experiencing a significant decline in the first half of the year  our bioprocess business stabilized in the second half of as some of our large key accounts increased their purchases 
however  full year bioprocess revenues declined  primarily due to the softness experienced in north america in the first half of operating profit increased to million in from million in higher revenues and a more profitable business and product mix were the primary drivers 
additionally  productivity improvements resulting from our global supply chain initiatives  the alignment of our costs to account for weaker than expected revenue growth  and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation contributed to the increase in our operating margin 
our operating profit margin slightly increased to percent in from percent in diluted earnings per share eps of in increased compared to higher operating profit and lower interest expense both contributed to higher eps 
we generated million of operating cash flows in  a percent increase over we repaid million of our overall debt during the year 
we will continue to focus on improving our operating cash flow  which we expect to use to further reduce our debt and make business acquisitions 
we announced the first phase of our global supply chain initiative in we will complete this phase in on september   we announced the second phase of the program  which we expect will enable us to further optimize the performance of our global supply millipore form k 
table of contents part ii chain and improve operational efficiency by reducing our cost structure 
we undertook this initiative in part to respond to market conditions causing revenue declines in our bioprocess division 
more importantly  however  it is part of our long term strategy to further improve the efficiency of our global supply chain 
results of operations revenues the performance of our broader business portfolio  the underlying growth of our business in europe and asia pacific  and the execution of our strategy resulted in revenue growth in by shifting the geographic composition of our revenues  we have been able to maintain revenue growth in spite of declines in some of our key north american markets 
bioprocess division versus bioprocess revenues of million in increased only million from this increase included a favorable foreign currency translation effect of percent 
adjusting for this item  bioprocess revenues declined percent in this decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of certain upstream and downstream bioprocessing products used in biopharmaceutical manufacturing  which was partially offset by increased sales of our process monitoring tools products 
lower sales of our upstream and downstream bioprocessing products were caused by lower spending by some of our largest biotechnology customers and weakening global economic conditions 
we experienced significantly lower sales to these customers  because of their reduced rate of monoclonal antibody production and the reduction of their inventory levels since the third quarter of our process monitoring tools  which are used to test for biopharmaceutical contaminants  performed well in these products are sold to a diverse customer base  some of which have not been adversely affected by the sales softness we are experiencing with our large biotechnology customers 
in particular  we experienced increased demand for our novaseptum products  a product line we acquired in our acquisition of novaseptic 
bioprocess revenues were also adversely affected by fewer approvals of new biologic drugs in recent quarters 
new biologic drug approvals are a significant driver of our bioprocess revenue growth 
despite the recent lower demand  we believe the overall biotechnology industry remains healthy 
this is evidenced by the growth in a number of commercially marketed biologic drugs and vaccines and continued investments in new biologic facilities and biotechnology companies 
after experiencing a significant decline in the first half of the year  our bioprocess division stabilized in the second half of as some of our large key accounts increased their purchases 
sales of our disposable systems and components continued to experience strong growth year over year

table of contents part ii revenues by geography logo from a geographic perspective  revenues for in the americas  europe and asia pacific were million  million  and million  respectively 
excluding the favorable foreign currency translation effect  revenues in the americas  europe and asia pacific decreased percent  increased percent  and increased percent  respectively  in over the decrease in the americas was primarily attributable to the lower sales to a handful of our largest biotechnology customers in the first half of the increase in europe was primarily driven by sales of our process monitoring tools products  which was somewhat offset by a decline in sales of both upstream and downstream bioprocessing products in the second half 
the increase in asia pacific was primarily driven by strong sales of downstream bioprocessing products in japan and china in the year and higher purchases from a large customer for a new manufacturing plant in asia 
versus bioprocess revenues of million for increased million  or percent  compared to this increase included a favorable effect of foreign currency translation of percent and a favorable effect of business acquisitions of percent 
adjusting for these items  bioprocess revenues for grew percent 
our year over year revenue growth rate was adversely affected by reductions in purchases of our chromatography media and cell culture supplements products from a limited number of our key us customers in the second half 
revenue growth in was primarily attributable to higher sales of our products used in downstream bioprocessing  particularly our filtration and systems hardware and components products 
sales of our systems hardware and components products grew in because of our customers drug manufacturing campaigns occurring in europe and asia 
sales of our disposable systems and components products grew because more customers migrated to single use  disposable technologies that eliminate the need for cleaning stainless steel and glass equipment 
biopharmaceutical manufacturers also seek flexible manufacturing components and solutions because they enable reduced time between manufacturing runs and because they can be configured and validated to meet customized biological manufacturing needs 
sales of our process monitoring tools  which are used to test for biopharmaceutical contaminants  increased because of the overall health of the biopharmaceutical markets in europe and asia

excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and acquired businesses  revenues in the americas  europe and asia pacific decreased percent  increased percent  and increased percent  respectively  in over the americas decrease was primarily attributable to the sales decline of our chromatography media and cell culture supplements products 
the european and asia pacific increases were primarily attributable to higher sales of our downstream processing systems hardware products 
our core process filtration products also had strong growth in europe and asia pacific regions  particularly in china and india  which was the result of our direct investment in sales and marketing and infrastructure for these markets 
bioscience division versus bioscience revenues of million for increased million  or percent  compared to this increase included a favorable foreign currency translation effect of percent 
adjusting for this item  bioscience revenues grew percent  which was primarily driven by continued strong demand for our laboratory water products and services 
bioscience revenue growth was reduced by percent due to the elimination of a small product line 
successful new product introductions  execution of our sales and marketing initiatives  and continued expansion of our new e commerce business platform all contributed to the revenue growth 
the successful launch of new products in the past two years such as the milli q integral and milli q advantage by our laboratory water business unit and strong growth in consumables and services contributed to the strong performance 
our drug discovery business unit also grew driven by higher sales of biomarker and immunoassay products as a result of new product introductions 
sales of our life science business unit s biotools products also contributed to the revenue growth resulting from higher sales of analytical sample preparation  cell biology and molecular biology products 
this is a reflection of a healthy level of life science research activities in the protein research and cell biology markets 
from a geographic perspective  revenues for in the americas  europe  and asia pacific were million  million  and million  respectively 
excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation  revenues in the americas  europe  and asia pacific increased percent  percent  and percent  respectively  in over the increases in the americas were primarily attributable to the strength of our laboratory water and our drug discovery products  which was offset by a slight decline in life science products 
the increases in europe were primarily the result of strong sales of our laboratory water products and services while life science and drug discovery products also contributed to the millipore form k 
table of contents part ii growth in this geography 
the increases in asia pacific were primarily the result of strong sales of our laboratory water products and services  particularly in japan and china  and life science products in japan 
the growth in our life science products in both europe and asia pacific is partly attributable to the revenue synergies from our serologicals acquisition by bringing together devices and content 
versus bioscience revenues of million for increased million  or percent  compared to this increase included a percent favorable effect of foreign currency translation and a percent favorable effect of business acquisitions 
adjusting for these items  bioscience revenue for grew percent 
this year over year increase was primarily driven by the overall strength of the life sciences research market and increased levels of life sciences research and development in both universities and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  particularly in international markets 
revenue growth in was primarily attributable to strong demand for our laboratory water products and higher sales of our life sciences products  such as analytical sample preparation and molecular biology products 
our successful implementation of initiatives designed to align sales and product management goals  to prioritize key customer relationships  and to execute targeted sales and marketing campaigns has positioned us well with our research customers 
our drug discovery business also grew in the second half  particularly in sales of multiplex immunoassays  because of strong market demand for such products 
from a geographic perspective  revenues for in the americas  europe and asia pacific were million  million and million  respectively 
excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and the acquired businesses  revenues in the americas  europe  and asia pacific increased percent  percent  and percent  respectively  in over the increases in the americas and europe were primarily attributable to higher sales of laboratory water and drug discovery products 
the majority of the remaining revenue increase occurred in international growth markets  particularly india and china 
this reflected the increased levels of life science research and the return on our continued investment in sales and marketing infrastructure in growing asia pacific markets 
gross profit margin versus gross profit increased million  or percent  in compared to the primary drivers of the increase were higher revenues  improved business and product mix  and productivity improvements 
bioscience revenues  which have higher gross profit margins  represented a larger percentage of our revenues  while sales of large bioprocess systems  chromatography media and insulin products with lower gross profit margins represented less of our sales mix 
additionally  the absence of serologicals business acquisition inventory fair value adjustments and acquisition integration costs in contributed to the increase 
somewhat offsetting increased gross profit margin was the adverse effect of a stronger euro 
when translated into us dollars  our irish and french manufacturing operations represented a higher proportion of our total manufacturing costs in gross profit margin for remained relatively flat at compared to the prior year 
in september  we announced the second phase of our global supply chain initiative  which is part of our long term strategy to further improve the efficiency of our global gross profit margin logo millipore form k 
table of contents part ii supply chain 
we incurred charges associated with our global supply chain initiative primarily employee separation costs  facility closure costs  and accelerated depreciation of million and million in and  respectively 
we expect to incur approximately million of additional costs related to this initiative in significant costs affecting our gross profit margin are shown below 
program and acquisition related expenses  versus in millions increase decrease manufacturing consolidation fair value adjustments for acquired inventory acquisition integration acquisition amortization total primarily employee separation costs  facility closure costs and accelerated depreciation 
versus gross profit increased million  or percent  in over increased sales volume  an improved business mix due to a higher proportion of bioscience revenues in  and productivity improvements and lower spending as a result of our supply chain initiatives contributed to the increase 
in addition  we had lower expense related to business acquisition inventory fair value adjustments and lower integration costs related to the serologicals acquisition in  compared to increased sales volume was primarily due to the inclusion of serologicals in our operating results for the full year in  compared to weeks in this had a favorable impact on our business mix 
significant costs affecting our gross profit margin are shown below 
program and acquisition related expenses  versus in millions increase decrease manufacturing consolidation fair value adjustments for acquired inventory acquisition integration acquisition amortization total primarily employee separation costs  facility closure costs and accelerated depreciation 
somewhat offsetting increased gross profit margin was the adverse effect of a stronger euro 
as a result  when translated into us dollars  our irish and french manufacturing operations represented a higher proportion of our total manufacturing costs in selling  general and administrative expenses versus selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses increased million  or percent  in compared to foreign currency translation accounted for percent of this year over year increase 
other primary sg a as a percent of sales logo millipore form k 
table of contents part ii drivers of the increase were higher employee compensation  separation expenses associated with our ongoing efforts to streamline operations  increased stock based compensation expense  a fixed asset impairment loss  and higher amortization of intangible assets 
stock based compensation expense of million in increased million  or percent  over as a result of changes we made to our equity compensation plans in the fixed asset impairment loss amounted to million and was related to an idle facility 
these costs were partially offset by a curtailment gain of million related to amendments to our us postretirement benefits plan 
full year amortization of intangible assets affecting sg a were million  compared with million in versus sg a expenses increased million  or percent  in compared to the sg a expense increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of serologicals sg a expenses in our operating results for the full year in compared to weeks in  significantly higher amortization of intangible assets  the unfavorable translation effect of the weaker us dollar  increased labor related costs attributable to our continued investment in our sales and marketing infrastructure  and increased stock based compensation expense 
the increase in our average headcount was a significant driver of our sg a expense growth because employee related expenses represents over percent of our total sg a costs 
in  our average employee headcount increased approximately percent compared to amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets increased million to million in compared to million in serologicals integration costs were million in compared to million in stock based compensation expense of million increased million  or percent  compared to because of changes we made to our equity compensation plans in in  we incurred million of expense related to an environmental liability and million of expense relating to the curtailment of our retirement plan 
these charges did not recur in r d as a percent of sales logo research and development expenses versus research and development r d expenses decreased million  or percent  in compared to the decreases were primarily the result of the timing of project spending 
our r d expenses also decreased million because of higher r d credits resulting from a change in legislation 
our strategy is to enhance our internal r d capabilities through technology collaborations and license arrangements with third parties 
we expect r d expenses to be approximately percent of sales in versus r d expenses increased million  or percent  in over higher r d expenses in were primarily attributable to the full year inclusion of serologicals  labor related costs attributable to increased headcount and increased spending on new product development 
millipore form k 
table of contents part ii interest income expense interest income expense in millions interest income interest expense average interest rate during the year versus interest expense decreased million  or percent  in compared to the decrease was primarily the result of lower debt balances as we continued to repay debt 
this was somewhat offset by the effect of a stronger euro on our euro denominated debt 
our revolving credit facility is comprised of floating rate borrowings based on us and euro libor 
increases or decreases in these rates would cause increases or decreases to our interest expense  respectively 
versus interest income decreased million  or percent  in compared to this was the result of lower investment balances due to prior year sales of marketable securities 
the proceeds of those sales were used  in part  to fund our serologicals acquisition on july  interest expense increased million  or percent  in over this increase included a full year of interest related to our million of percent convertible senior notes and our million of percent senior notes issued in june to fund the acquisition of serologicals 
the effect of higher average interest rates in were partially offset by a lower overall debt balance as we continued to repay debt 
provision for income taxes effective income tax rate versus the effective income tax rates for  and reflected the tax benefit associated with lower tax rates on certain international earnings  which we intend to indefinitely invest outside of the us the higher current year effective tax rate was caused by a shift in the jurisdictional mix of our profits to higher tax rate jurisdictions and less previously unrecognized tax benefits 
during  we recorded million of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of statute of limitations closures 
we also released valuation allowances on certain research and development r d tax credits amounting to million as a result of a tax law change in the united states 
over the next months  we may need to record up to million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in the event of statute of limitations closures 
the lower effective tax rate was primarily attributable to recording million of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of statute of limitations closures and a pretax income mix favoring lower tax rate jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  we are examined by various tax authorities  including the internal revenue service the irs 
in  the irs concluded its examination of years and  without any significant adjustments 
we provide for us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely invested outside the us we elected to treat the earnings of our ireland  united kingdom and sweden subsidiaries as indefinitely invested outside the us these elections were made based on our operating plans and foreign debt service requirements 
versus the decrease in the effective tax rate compared to was primarily attributable to the release of tax reserves amounting to million and a pretax income mix favoring lower tax rate jurisdictions in lower us pretax profits as a result of reduced purchases from our large us biotechnology customers and significantly millipore form k 
table of contents part ii higher expenses for interest and amortization were the primary causes of the mix shift 
in addition  the shift in the mix of our pretax income was also the result of the continued shift of our production activities to ireland in accordance with the manufacturing consolidation strategy 
operating profit  net income and diluted earnings per share operating profit  net income and diluted earnings per share in millions  except per share data operating profit operating profit margin net income diluted earnings per share versus operating profit increased million  or percent  in compared to primarily as a result of higher gross profit and lower r d expenses  offset by higher sg a expenses 
the percent increase in net income and percent increase in diluted earnings per share were attributable to higher operating profit and lower interest expense  partially offset by a higher tax rate in improvement in profitability logo versus the improvement in operating profit  net income and diluted earnings per share was primarily due to higher gross profit 
net income increased million  or percent  in compared to the increase was primarily the result of higher operating profit and the lower effective tax rate  somewhat offset by higher interest expense associated with the financing of the serologicals acquisition 
diluted earnings per share increased  or percent  in compared to the increase was the result of the reasons discussed above 
capital resources and liquidity the following table shows information about our capitalization as of the dates indicated total capitalization in millions cash and cash equivalents total debt   total capitalization debt plus equity   debt to total capitalization we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing  and financing activities 
our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to fund operations  capital expenditures  investments in businesses  product development  and debt service 
our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
the sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by  among other factors  a decrease in demand for our products  our ability to integrate acquisitions  deterioration in certain financial ratios  and market changes in general 
millipore form k 
table of contents part ii recent distress in the global economy has had an adverse impact on financial market activities including  among other things  volatility in security prices  diminished liquidity and credit availability  and declining valuations of certain investments 
we have assessed the implications of these factors on our current business and determined that there has not been a significant impact to our financial position  results of operations  or liquidity during there can be no assurance  however  that changing circumstances will not affect our future financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk based interest rates is partly a function of our existing debt to capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing 
our credit ratings are reviewed regularly by major debt rating agencies such as standard poor s and moody s investors service 
our senior unsecured notes are rated bbb by standard poor s and ba by moody s investors service and our revolving credit facility is rated bbb and baa by standard and poor s and moody s investors service  respectively 
our senior convertible notes are rated bb by standard poor s and have not been rated by moody s investors service 
we believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and investing cash needs 
in response to the distress in the global economy  we increased our cash balance in the united states to mitigate any unanticipated liquidity issues with our banking partners 
we intend to maintain the balance at a similar level for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  our ability to obtain equity financing  as well as availability of additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility  provide additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences 
however  these cash balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations 
we have transferred  and will continue to transfer  cash from our subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 
on february   we acquired guava technologies  inc guava  a provider of easy to use  bench top cell analysis systems for million  subject to closing adjustments 
we paid for the acquisition with available cash on hand 
guava generated approximately million in sales during cash flows the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash over the periods indicated sources and uses of cash in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities  net cash used for provided by financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating cash flows cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily attributable to our net income of million and non cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization expenses of million  stock based compensation expense of million  and other non cash expenses of million 
these factors were partially offset by deferred income tax benefits of million and a net working capital increase of million 
our deferred income tax benefits were the result of a decrease in our deferred tax liabilities associated with the amortization of acquired intangible assets from business acquisitions  which are not tax deductible 
the increase in our working capital from december  to december  was primarily millipore form k 
table of contents part ii logo logo attributable to decreases in accounts payable of million  caused by the timing of vendor payments  a decrease in other liabilities of million  caused by increased retirement plan funding requirements  an increase in other current assets of million primarily caused by the timing of income tax payments  decreases in accounts receivable of million caused by our continued focus on cash collection  and a decrease in inventory of million 
the decreased inventory balances caused the number of days supply in ending inventory to decrease days to days at december  compared to days at december  the number of days sales outstanding in ending accounts receivable was days at december  compared with days at december  investing cash flows cash used for investing activities was million during compared with million during during  we paid million for capital expenditures  million for the settlement of derivative transactions  and million for various technology and distribution rights 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million for cash paid for capital expenditures was lower in compared to and because of large non recurring capital projects completed in those years 
financing cash flows cash used for financing activities was million during compared with million during repayments of debt in included net revolver repayments of million 
cash used in financing activities was partially offset by cash received from employees upon the exercise of stock options amounting to million 
we will continue to focus on debt repayment with excess cash generated from our operations 
to the extent that our cash is not required to pay for capital expenditures or business acquisitions  we plan to pay down our revolver borrowings and may from time to time repurchase our convertible notes or euro notes in private transactions

table of contents part ii financing commitments short term debt short term debt at december  consisted of borrowings under our operating bank facilities 
revolving credit facilities we have a five year unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver that expires in june the revolver provides for a maximum borrowing of million  or million 
we may elect to increase the credit facilities by an amount not in excess of million 
we may prepay any outstanding borrowings in whole or in part without premium or penalty 
we are required to pay an unused commitment fee ranging between percent and percent annually based on the revolver s debt rating 
we are required to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios as set forth in the revolver agreement 
the agreement also includes limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to merge  consolidate  or sell assets  to create liens  to make payments in respect of capital stock or subordinated debt  as well as other customary covenants and representations 
in general  the leverage ratio is calculated by dividing our total outstanding indebtedness at december  by our cumulative adjusted cash earnings for the twelve months ended at december  the interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our cumulative adjusted cash earnings for the twelve months ended at december  by our cumulative gross interest expense for the twelve months ended at december  the definitions of the factors used to calculate these leverage and interest coverage ratios are included in the revolver agreement 
the following table summarizes the financial covenant requirements as of december  and thereafter and our compliance with these covenants as of december  revolver agreement covenants requirement actual at december  maximum leverage ratio minimum interest coverage ratio our ability to continue to comply with these covenants will depend primarily on the success in growing our business and generating substantial operating cash flows 
future compliance with the covenants may be adversely affected by various economic  financial  and industry factors 
noncompliance with the covenants would constitute an event of default under the revolver  allowing the lenders to accelerate repayment of any outstanding borrowings 
in the event of any potential failure by us to continue to be in compliance with any covenants  we would seek to negotiate amendments to the applicable covenants or to obtain compliance waivers from our lenders 
as of december   we had borrowings outstanding under the revolver of million  which were classified as long term debt 
as of december   we had million available for borrowing under the revolver 
the borrowing capacity allowed by our debt covenants under the revolver was million at december  in december  we entered into revolving credit agreements with two japanese banks 
the credit facilities millipore form k 
table of contents part ii provide for cumulative borrowings of billion us dollar equivalent of million with an interest rate of tibor plus an applicable margin 
interest is payable at the end of an interest period based upon the term of the borrowing 
these credit facilities expire in june and december and are subject to annual renewal at terms consistent with the initial agreement 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under these facilities 
convertible senior notes due in june  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes the convertible notes in a private placement offering 
the convertible notes bear interest at percent per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year 
commencing with the six month period beginning on december   if the average trading price of the convertible notes for the five consecutive trading days preceding such six month periods equals percent or more of the principal amount  contingent interest will accrue at the rate of percent of the average trading price of the convertible notes 
the convertible notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness 
the convertible notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness and all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries  including trade payables 
the convertible notes will mature on june  we used the net proceeds from this offering to complete the acquisition of serologicals on july  we recorded million of deferred financing costs associated with this offering 
holders of the convertible notes may convert their notes into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock prior to june  under certain conditions 
the convertible notes may be converted if the closing sale price of our common stock for each of the or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds percent of the conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter 
the convertible notes may also be converted during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period in which the average trading price per  principal amount of the convertible notes was equal to or less than percent of the average conversion value of the notes during this period 
the convertible notes will also be convertible if we make certain distributions on our common stock or engage in certain transactions  if we call the convertible notes for redemption  and at any time from november  through december  and any time on or after june  upon conversion  the convertible notes will be converted into cash for the principal amount and shares of our common stock for the conversion premium  if any  based on an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustments 
on or after december   we have the option to redeem the convertible notes at a redemption price equal to percent of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued but unpaid interest

our non cancellable purchase obligations include obligations related to the future purchase of goods and services  capital lease obligations  and other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which is uncertain 
we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities 
critical accounting estimates preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant areas involving management estimates  judgments and assumptions are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is recognized when we meet all of the criteria specified in securities exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
these criteria include logo evidence of an arrangement is in place  logo related prices are fixed or determinable  logo delivery or performance has occurred  and logo collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
customer purchase orders or sales agreements evidence our sales arrangements 
these purchase orders and sales agreements specify both selling prices and quantities  which are the basis for recording sales revenue 
trade terms for the majority of our sales contracts indicate that title and risk of loss pass from us to our customers when we ship products from our facilities  which is when revenue is recognized 
revenue is deferred until our products arrive at customers facilities in situations where trade terms indicate that title and risk of loss pass from us to the customers upon their receipt of our products 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and ship products only to customers that satisfy our credit evaluation 
we also maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make required payments 
we have not experienced any deterioration in the credit quality of our customers in the recent distress in the global economy 
consumable and hardware products excluding fixed price contracts account for over percent of our total consolidated revenues and are typically sold with standard terms and conditions 
revenues for these products are generally recognized upon shipment or delivery to the customers 
in instances where we sell filtration systems products with a related installation obligation  we generally recognize revenue related to the filtration systems when title passes and recognize revenue related to the installation when installation is complete 
the allocation of revenue between the filtration system and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale 
in limited cases  our customers may require site acceptance testing for certain customized products built to customers specifications 
revenues on these products are deferred upon shipment and are recognized when site acceptance testing is completed 
revenue from service arrangements is recognized when the services are provided  or over the contractual period 
for millipore form k 
table of contents part ii laboratory water systems  installation and maintenance service revenues are recognized when the site service visit is completed 
for validation testing services  revenue is recognized when the contracted study is completed and accepted by the customer 
for sample analysis services  revenue is recognized as each sample analysis is completed 
for assay development and assay validation services  revenue is recognized proportionally as contractually defined deliverables are provided to the customer 
revenue related to maintenance and warranty service contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual period or as the services are performed  based on the terms of the arrangement 
revenue for fixed price contracts associated with our large  custom process equipment business is recognized under the percentage of completion method poc 
approximately percent of our revenue was derived from poc sales in revenue is recognized based on the ratio of hours expended compared with the total estimated hours to complete the construction of the process equipment 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimates of the percent completed is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
in the event that assumptions used in calculating poc during the construction of the process equipment are later revised  total revenue and expenses estimated for contracts upon completion could differ from the latter estimate 
if it is estimated that the project will result in a loss when completed  the entire loss is recognized at that point 
actual results related to poc estimates have been materially the same as the assumptions used at the beginning of each contract 
in addition  should a poc contract be cancelled while in progress  we would generally be able to recover expenses incurred with progress payments previously received during the design and construction period 
typically  such progress payments can range between percent and percent of the total contract sales value 
historically  we have experienced few cancellations 
we recognize license and royalty revenue when the amounts are determinable and we have fulfilled our obligations under the applicable agreement 
this generally occurs when cash payments are received or licensed sales are reported to us 
inventory valuation our product life cycle is generally a minimum of years and may be in excess of years 
therefore  we generally rely upon recent historic usage  expiration dates  and estimated future demand in estimating the realizable value of our inventory 
finished goods and components that are determined to be obsolete are written off when such determination is made 
in certain cases  such as for newly introduced products and overstocked products  estimated future demand is considered in establishing inventory writedowns 
raw material and work in process inventories are also reviewed for obsolescence and alternative or future use based on reviewing manufacturing plans  estimated future demand and market conditions 
in situations where it is determined that work in process inventories cannot be converted into finished goods  the inventories are written down to net realizable value 
inventory at december  reflected cumulative net realizable value write downs of million 
should it be determined that write downs are insufficient  we would be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative impact on gross profit margin 
once recorded  inventory valuation provisions are not subsequently reversed unless the related inventory items are subsequently sold 
valuation of long lived assets valuation of certain long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  and goodwill requires significant judgment 
assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition 
a significant portion of the purchase price in our acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets and goodwill 
assigning value to intangible assets requires that we use significant judgment in determining i the fair value  and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or non amortizable and  if the former  the period and the method by which the intangible assets will be amortized 
we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques  such as the income approach and the cost approach  as appropriate  in establishing the fair value of long lived assets 
typically  key assumptions include projected revenue and expense levels used in establishing the fair value of business acquisitions as well millipore form k 
table of contents part ii as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital  adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets 
changes in the initial assumptions could lead to changes in amortization expense recorded in our future financial statements 
for intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  we assess the carrying value of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following logo significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  logo significant negative industry or economic trends  or logo significant changes or developments in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our long lived assets 
should we determine that the carrying value of long lived tangible and intangible assets may not be recoverable  we will measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
we may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets  as appropriate 
significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows  including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 
in november  we changed our marketing strategy for an idle facility because of continued weakness in the united states real estate market  excess production capacity in the north american biopharmaceutical industry  and the current global economic crisis 
we analyzed the expected cash flows from different sales scenarios and determined that the net carrying value of the assets was not recoverable 
we recorded an impairment loss of million to adjust the carrying value to the estimated fair value  which is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value was determined based on sell ing price of comparable assets and discounted over the period of time which we expect it will take to sell the facility and the related equipment 
we perform annual reviews in our second quarter for impairment of goodwill or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill may be considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the reporting unit s fair value 
our reporting units are our bioprocess and bioscience operating segments 
assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and cash earnings multiples  and compare the values to our estimated enterprise value 
our annual impairment test did not indicate any impairment on our goodwill 
in response to the recent distress in the global economy  we reassessed our goodwill as of december  and concluded that there was no impairment 
stock based compensation we follow the methodology of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment fas r  using the modified prospective approach upon initial adoption  to account for all of our stock based awards 
stock based compensation expense is estimated as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes option pricing model and the fair value of our restricted stock awards and restricted stock units based on the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
we recognize the associated compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical pre vesting forfeiture history and are updated on a quarterly basis to reflect actual forfeitures of unvested awards and other known events 
millipore form k 
table of contents part ii estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment  including the expected term of our stock options  volatility of our stock  expected dividends and risk free interest rates over the expected term of the options 
the expected term represents the average time that options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on the historical exercise  post vesting cancellation and expiration patterns of our stock based awards 
the expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical volatilities of our common stock over a period of time that approximates the expected term of the options 
expected dividends are estimated based on our dividend history as well as our current projections 
the risk free interest rate for periods approximating the expected terms of the options is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant 
income taxes we recognize income taxes when transactions are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations  with deferred taxes provided for items that are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
at december   we had valuation allowances of million related to federal research credits  million related to state tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards  and million related to a capital loss carryforward 
we are a worldwide business 
we are subject to tax audits on a regular basis 
because significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes  we periodically assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based on our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we estimate and record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
for those income tax positions that are not likely to be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements 
we believe our tax reserves are necessary to appropriately reflect tax obligations that may arise out of current and future audits 
any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
over the next months  we may need to record up to million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in the event of statute of limitations closures 
in the normal course of business  we are examined by various tax authorities  including the irs 
in  the irs concluded its examination of years and  without any significant adjustments 
we provide for us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely invested outside the us we elected to treat the earnings of our ireland  united kingdom and sweden subsidiaries as indefinitely invested outside the us these elections were made based on our operating plans and foreign debt service requirements 
employee retirement plans in the us  we sponsor a pension plan and a postretire ment medical plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
for both plans  we determine several key assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of the plans  typically on an annual basis 
for the pension plan  these key assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
in selecting the expected return on assets  we considered the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan 
this included considering the asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan 
the assumed discount rate is intended to approximate the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled 
we used the citigroup pension discount curve as the benchmark rate for estimating our discount rate for pension expense 
in addition  we update  as needed  other assumptions used in determining the expense and liabilities of the plan  such as withdrawal and mortality assumptions millipore form k 
table of contents part ii based on the average age grouping of our plan participants and updated mortality tables published by the society of actuaries 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by us in future years 
during  we recognized our pension expense using a discount rate of percent and an expected return on plan assets of percent related to our us pension plan 
the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our us pension plan were the discount rates and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
although they were the most sensitive assumptions  a percentage point change in either assumption would be immaterial to our results of operations and financial position 
for the postretirement medical plan  significant assumptions included the discount rate  the future medical cost escalation rate  withdrawal rates and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from future actual results because of changing conditions in the growth of medical expenses or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of postretirement medical expense recorded by us 
during  we recognized our expense using a discount rate of percent for months and percent for months because the amendments to the plan in august triggered a new measurement date under sfas no 
and an expected medical cost escalation rate that declines gradually from percent in to percent in although these are the most sensitive assumptions  a percentage point change in either assumption would be immaterial to our results of operations and financial position 
in august  we made a number of amendments to our us postretirement benefit plan effective january  these amendments included the elimination of dental and life insurance benefits  medical benefit cost sharing changes for pre retirees  and the elimination of medical coverage for employees who retire after december  we recorded a curtailment gain of million in selling  general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations for the three months ended september  as a result of these amendments 
in certain foreign subsidiaries  we also sponsor pension plans for our employees 
accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of country specific assumptions for discount rates  expected returns on assets  and rates of compensation increases 
we apply a consistent methodology  year over year  in determining the key assumptions 
our discount rates are based on high quality bond indices for durations that approximate the average remaining service periods of our plan participants in each country 
we select expected long term rates of return on assets based on the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under these plans 
although the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our foreign pension plans are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets  a percentage point change in either assumption would be immaterial to our results of operations and financial position 
market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rate risk  and credit risk 
we manage these market risks through our normal financing and operating activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in revenues  net income  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates represents a substantial risk to us because approximately percent of our business was conducted outside of the united states for the year ended december   generally in foreign currencies 
our primary risk management strategy is to use forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
the intent of this strategy is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying booked exposures with millipore form k 
table of contents part ii gains and losses resulting from the forward exchange contracts that hedge these exposures 
principal hedged currencies include the euro  japanese yen  and great britain pound 
gains and losses resulting from changes in the value of the derivative are recognized currently in earnings or reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
this depends on the use of the derivative and whether it has been designated and qualifies as an effective hedge 
as of december   we had open forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted intercompany sales with total us dollar equivalent notional amounts of approximately million 
these forward exchange contracts are generally short term in nature and mature through february based on our analysis  a hypothetical adverse foreign exchange rate movement of percent against our forward exchange contracts would have resulted in a net loss in fair value of these contracts of approximately million 
in addition  we also hold forward exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange risk related to certain foreign currency denominated receivable and payable balances 
changes in fair value of these forward exchange contracts are recorded through current earnings because these instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting 
as of december   the us dollar equivalent notional amounts of the forward exchange contracts related to foreign currency denominated receivable and payable balances totaled million 
the periods of these forward exchange contracts typically span less than three months 
the fair value of these forward exchange contracts was a net gain of million at december  during  we entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk related to foreign currency denominated debt 
the initial forward exchange contracts matured in october  resulting in a realized loss of million 
at the same time  we entered into additional forward exchange contracts which matured in april  resulting in a realized loss of million 
the net realized losses on these forward exchange contracts were substantially offset by gains on the underlying transactions 
our risk management policy allows for hedging our net investments in foreign subsidiaries  using both derivative and non derivative instruments 
in june  we issued million of euro denominated senior notes which gives rise to foreign exchange risk when the debt is remeasured into us dollars at the end of each period 
the remeasurement gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income because we designated this debt as an economic hedge of our net investments in european subsidiaries 
upon maturity  however  we could be exposed to significant exchange rate risk because we will be required to repay the debt at the then current market exchange rates  which could be higher than the rates at which we borrowed the debt in june as of december   we have recorded a cumulative loss of million in accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to the change in value of the us dollar versus the euro since the issuance of the notes 
a further percent strengthening or weakening of the euro against the us dollar will cause this cumulative loss to increase or decrease by million 
we do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates in the normal course of our business operations as a result of our ongoing investing and financing activities  which affect our debt as well as cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   our debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings 
our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to our revolving credit facilities  under which the interest rates on our borrowings float with libor rates 
the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of our convertible notes is affected by our stock price 
the total estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt at december  was million 
millipore form k 
table of contents part ii fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates  non performance risk and terms to maturity 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by percent  the fair value of our long term debt would decrease or increase by approximately million 
we assess our interest rate risks on a regular basis and do not currently use financial instruments to mitigate these risks 
credit risk we are exposed to concentrations of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  and forward exchange contracts 
cash and cash equivalents are placed with major financial institutions with high quality credit ratings 
the amount placed with any one institution is limited by policy 
trade receivables credit risk exposure is limited because of our large number of established customers and their dispersion across different geographies 
no single customer accounted for percent or more of our consolidated trade receivables as of december  we are exposed to credit risk on our hedging instruments in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
the fair value of gains on derivative instruments reflects adjustments for non performance risks of the counterparties 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties because our hedging activities are transacted only with financial institutions with high credit ratings

fsp requires issuers of such convertible debt instruments to allocate the proceeds to a liability component  issued at a discount  and an equity component

the remaining million will be reclassified as additional paid in capital  which reflects the value attributable to the conversion feature 
this reclassification will create a debt discount of million that will be amortized as interest expense over the five and one half year period from june  to december   which represents the expected life of the instrument
