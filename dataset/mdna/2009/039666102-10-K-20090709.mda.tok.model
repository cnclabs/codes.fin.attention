item a 
risk factors risk related to our business and industry we operate in an emerging and evolving market and have a history of losses  and we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses 
we launched our esm products in january and our first arcsight logger product in december because the market for our products is relatively new and rapidly evolving  it is difficult for us to predict our operating results and the ultimate size of the market for our products 
although we recorded net income of million for the fiscal year ended april   we have a history of losses from operations  incurring losses from operations of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended april   and  respectively 
as of april   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel  expand and improve the effectiveness of our distribution channel program and develop our technology and new products 
in addition  we have incurred  and anticipate that we will continue to incur  significant legal  accounting and other expenses relating to being a public company 
if our revenues do not increase to offset these expected increases in operating expenses  we may not continue to be profitable in future periods 
our historical revenue growth has been inconsistent  reflects fluctuations not related to performance and should not be considered indicative of our future performance 
see the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sources of revenue  cost of revenues and operating expenses 
further  in future periods  our 
table of contents revenues could decline and  accordingly  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a consistent basis  which may result in a decline in our common stock price 
our future operating results may fluctuate significantly and our current operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
our revenues and operating results could vary significantly from period to period as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
as a result  comparing our revenues and operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful  and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance 
for example  revenues in fiscal and prior years excluded revenues related to multiple element sales transactions consummated in that year that were deferred because we did not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  for some product elements that were not delivered in the fiscal year of the transaction 
in fiscal and  we either delivered these product elements  or we and our customers amended the contractual terms of these sales transactions to remove the undelivered product elements 
our operating results in any particular quarterly period in fiscal may be similarly impacted as we recognize this previously deferred revenue 
we may not be able to accurately predict our future revenues or results of operations 
we base our current and future expense levels on our operating plans and sales forecasts  and our operating costs are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  we may not be able to reduce our costs sufficiently to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenues  and even a small shortfall in revenues could disproportionately and adversely affect financial results for that quarter 
in addition  we recognize revenues from sales to some customers or resellers when cash is received  which may be delayed because of changes or issues with those customers or resellers 
if our revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts that may choose to cover our stock  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
in addition to other risk factors listed in this section  factors that may affect our operating results include the timing of our sales during the quarter  particularly since a large portion of our sales occurs in the last few weeks of the quarter and loss or delay of a few large contracts may have a significant adverse impact on our operating results  changes in the mix of revenues attributable to higher margin revenues from esm products as opposed to lower margin revenues from sales of our appliance products  the timing of satisfying revenue recognition criteria  including  for example  establishing vsoe for new products and maintaining vsoe for maintenance and services  particularly where we accrue the associated commission expense in a different period  and sufficient history with respect to our newly introduced appliance licensing model such that revenue recognition criteria would be met on shipment of our appliances  rather than delaying revenue recognition until payment for these transactions in which we will be required to do until such history is established  changes in the renewal rate of maintenance agreements  our ability to estimate warranty claims accurately  general economic conditions  both domestically and in our foreign markets  and economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers participate  such as the impact of the recent and continuing severe deterioration in global and us economic and financial market conditions on the financial services and retail industries  and the impact of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas  or fin  which requires us to establish reserves for uncertain tax positions and accrue potential tax penalties and interest 

table of contents our sales cycle is long and unpredictable  and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense 
as a result  our revenues are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from quarter to quarter  which may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
our operating results may fluctuate  in part  because of the intensive nature of our sales efforts  the length and variability of the sales cycle of our esm products and the short term difficulty in adjusting our operating expenses 
because decisions to purchase products such as our esm products involve significant capital commitments by customers  potential customers generally have our products evaluated at multiple levels within an organization  each often having specific and conflicting requirements 
enterprise customers make product purchasing decisions based in part on factors not directly related to the features of the products  including but not limited to the customers projections of business growth  uncertainty regarding economic conditions  capital budgets and anticipated cost savings from implementation of the software 
as a result of these factors  selling our products often requires an extensive effort throughout a customer s organization 
the recent and continuing severe deterioration in global and us economic and financial market conditions has increased the duration and intensity of our sales efforts as customers enhance their review of spending decisions 
in addition  we have less experience with sales of arcsight logger  arcsight express and our other appliance products 
as a result  the sales cycle for these products may be lengthy or may vary significantly 
our sales efforts involve educating our customers  who are often relatively unfamiliar with our products and their technical capabilities  as well as the value of our products  including the potential cost savings to the organization that our products may generate 
we spend substantial time  effort and money in our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales 
the length of our sales cycle  from initial evaluation to delivery of products  tends to be long and varies substantially from customer to customer 
our sales cycle is typically three to six months but can extend to more than a year for some sales 
we typically recognize a large portion of our product revenues in the last few weeks of a quarter 
it is difficult to predict exactly when  or even if  we will actually make a sale with a potential customer 
as a result  large individual sales have  in some cases  occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated  or have not occurred at all 
the loss or delay of one or more large product transactions in a quarter could impact our operating results for that quarter and any future quarters for which revenues from that transaction are delayed 
as a result of these factors  it is difficult for us to accurately forecast product revenues in any quarter 
because a substantial portion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  our operating results will suffer if revenues fall below our expectations in a particular quarter  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 
if we fail to further develop and manage our distribution channels  our revenues could decline and our growth prospects could suffer 
we derive a portion of our revenues from sales of our products and related services through channel partners  such as resellers and systems integrators 
in particular  systems integrators are an important source of sales leads for us in the us public sector  as government agencies often rely on them to meet information technology  or it  needs 
we also use resellers to augment our internal resources in international markets and  to a lesser extent  domestically 
we may be required by our us government customers to utilize particular resellers that may not meet our criteria for creditworthiness  and revenues from those resellers may not be recognizable until receipt of payment 
we have derived  and anticipate that in the future we will continue to derive  a substantial portion of the sales of arcsight logger and other appliance products through channel partners  including parties with which we have not yet developed relationships 
we expect that channel sales will represent a substantial portion of our us government and international revenues for the foreseeable future and  we believe  a growing portion of our us commercial revenues 
we may be unable to successfully expand and improve the effectiveness of our channel sales program 
if we do not successfully execute our strategy to increase channel sales  particularly to further penetrate the mid market and sell our appliance products  our growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected 
our agreements with our channel partners are generally non exclusive and many of our channel partners have more established relationships with our competitors 
if our channel partners do not effectively market and sell our products  if they choose to place greater emphasis on products of their own or those offered by our competitors  or if they fail to meet the needs of our customers  our ability to grow our business and sell our products may be adversely affected  particularly in the public sector  the mid market and internationally 
similarly  the loss of a substantial 
table of contents number of our channel partners  who may cease marketing our products and services with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty  and our possible inability to replace them  the failure to recruit additional channel partners  or any reduction or delay in their sales of our products and services or conflicts between channel sales and our direct sales and marketing activities could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  changes in the proportion of our revenues attributable to sales by channel partners  which are more likely than direct sales to involve collectability concerns at the time of contract execution and product delivery  may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period 
because we derive a majority of our revenues from arcsight esm and related products and services  any failure of this product to satisfy customer demands or to achieve increased market acceptance will harm our business  operating results  financial condition and growth prospects 
we have derived a majority of our product revenues from arcsight esm and related products 
demand for arcsight esm is affected by a number of factors beyond our control  including the timing of development and release of new products by us and our competitors  technological change  and lower than expected growth or a contraction in the worldwide market for enterprise compliance and security management solutions or other risks described in this annual report on form k 
if we are unable to continue to meet customer demands or to achieve more widespread market acceptance of arcsight esm  our business  operating results  financial condition and growth prospects will be adversely affected 
if we are unable to successfully develop and market new products  make enhancements to our existing products or expand our offerings into new markets  our business may not grow and our operating results may suffer 
we introduced our first arcsight logger product in fiscal and are currently developing new versions of this product  esm and the other products in our siem platform  as well as new complementary products 
our growth strategy and future financial performance will depend  in part  on our ability to market and sell these products and to diversify our offerings by successfully developing  timely introducing and gaining customer acceptance of new products 
the software in our products  particularly our arcsight esm and arcsight express products  is especially complex because it must recognize  effectively interact with and manage a wide variety of devices and applications  and effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated security threats and other risks  while not impeding the high network performance demanded by our customers 
the typical development cycle for a patch to our esm software is one to three months  a service pack is four to six months and a new version or major sub version is to months  if and when available 
customers and industry analysts expect speedy introduction of software to respond to new threats and risks and to add new functionality  and we may be unable to meet these expectations 
since developing new products or new versions of  or add ons to  existing products is complex  the timetable for their commercial release is difficult to predict and may vary from our historical experience  which could result in delays in their introduction from anticipated or announced release dates 
we may not offer updates as rapidly as new threats affect our customers 
if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our customers by developing and introducing on a timely basis new and effective products  upgrades and services that can respond adequately to new security threats  our competitive position  business and growth prospects will be harmed 
diversifying our product offerings and expanding into new markets will require significant investment and planning  will bring us more directly into competition with software providers that may be better established or have greater resources than we do  will require additional investment of time and resources in the development and training of our channel and strategic partners and will entail significant risk of failure 
sales of our arcsight logger and arcsight express products and other products that we may develop and market may reduce revenues of our flagship esm product and our overall margin by offering a subset of features or capabilities of our flagship esm products at a reduced price with a lower gross margin 
if the average selling price for orders of such alternate products is lower  we may need to sell to a larger number of customers to achieve equivalent revenues  potentially incurring increased sales  marketing and general and administrative expenses in support of those sales 
moreover  increased emphasis on the sale of our appliance products  add on products or new product lines could distract us 
table of contents from sales of our core arcsight esm offering  negatively affecting our overall sales 
if we fail or delay in diversifying our existing offerings or expanding into new markets  or we are unsuccessful competing in these new markets  our business  operating results and prospects may suffer 
if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand  our business and operating results may be harmed 
we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand identity is critical to our relationships with  and to our ability to attract  new customers and partners 
the successful promotion of our brand will depend largely upon our marketing and public relations efforts  our ability to continue to offer high quality products and services  and our ability to successfully differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors  especially to the extent that our competitors integrate or bundle competitive offerings with a broader array of products and services that they may offer 
our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenues 
in addition  extension of our brand to products and uses different from our traditional products and services may dilute our brand  particularly if we fail to maintain the quality of our products and services in these new areas 
moreover  it may be difficult to maintain and enhance our brand in connection with sales through channel or strategic partners 
the promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures  and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our market becomes more competitive and as we expand into new markets 
to the extent that these activities yield increased revenues  these revenues may not offset the expenses we incur 
if we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand  our business may not grow  we may have reduced pricing power relative to competitors with stronger brands  and we could lose customers and channel partners  all of which would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  independent industry analysts often provide reviews of our products and services  as well as those of our competitors  and perception of our products in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews 
we have no control over what these industry analysts report  and because industry analysts may influence current and potential customers  our brand could be harmed if they do not provide a positive review of our products and services or view us as a market leader 
we face intense competition in our market  especially from larger  better known companies  and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 
the market for enterprise compliance and security management and log collection and storage products is intensely competitive  and we expect competition to increase in the future 
a significant number of companies have developed  or are developing  products that currently  or in the future are likely to  compete with some or all of our products 
we may not compete successfully against our current or potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial resources or brand name recognition 
companies competing with us may introduce products that have greater performance or functionality or incorporate technological advances that we have not yet developed or implemented 
in addition  companies competing with us may price their products more competitively than ours  or have an entirely different pricing or distribution model  such as making introductory versions with limited functionality available as freeware products 
our competitors include large software companies  software or hardware network infrastructure companies  smaller software companies offering more narrowly focused enterprise compliance and security management and log collection and storage products  and small and large companies offering point solutions that compete with components of our platform or individual products 
existing competitors for a compliance and security management software platform solution such as our esm products primarily are specialized  privately held companies  such as intellitactics and netforensics  as well as larger companies such as ca  cisco  emc  ibm  novell and symantec 
current competitors for sales of our arcsight logger products include specialized  privately held companies  such as loglogic and sensage 
in addition to these current competitors  we expect to face competition for our appliance products from existing large  diversified software and hardware companies  from specialized  smaller companies and from new companies that may seek to enter this market 
another source of competition is represented by the custom internal efforts undertaken by potential customers to analyze and manage the information produced from their existing devices and applications to identify and 
table of contents remediate threats 
many companies  in particular large corporate enterprises  have developed software internally that is an alternative to our enterprise compliance and security management and log collection and storage products 
wide adoption of our common event format  which we are promoting as a standard for event logs generated by security and other products  may facilitate this internal development 
wide adoption of our common event format may also allow our competitors to offer products with a degree of compatibility similar to ours or may facilitate new entrants into our business 
new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share due to factors such as greater brand name recognition  larger installed customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources and experience 
if these new competitors are successful  we would lose market share and our revenues would likely decline 
mergers or consolidations among our competitors  or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies  present heightened competitive challenges to our business 
for example  in recent years ibm has acquired internet security systems  inc  micromuse and consul  novell acquired e security and emc acquired network intelligence 
these acquisitions will make these combined entities potentially more formidable competitors to us if their products and offerings are effectively integrated 
continued industry consolidation may impact customers perceptions of the viability of smaller or even medium sized software firms and  consequently  customers willingness to purchase from those firms 
many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages  such as greater name recognition and longer operating histories  larger sales and marketing budgets and resources  the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products  broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners  access to larger customer bases  greater customer support  greater resources to make acquisitions  lower labor and development costs  and substantially greater financial  technical and other resources 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly and effectively to new or emerging technologies and changing opportunities  standards or customer requirements 
in addition  these companies have reduced  and could continue to reduce  the price of their enterprise compliance and security management  log collection and storage products and managed security services  resulting in intensified pricing pressures within our market 
increased competition could result in fewer customer orders  price reductions  reduced operating margins and loss of market share 
our larger competitors also may be able to provide customers with different or greater capabilities or benefits than we can provide in areas such as technical qualifications  geographic presence  or provide customers a broader range of services and products and price 
in addition  large competitors may have more extensive relationships within large enterprises  the federal government or foreign governments  which relationships may provide them with an advantage in competing for business with those potential customers 
our ability to compete will depend upon our ability to provide better performance than our competitors at a competitive price 
we may be required to make substantial additional investments in research  development  marketing and sales in order to respond to competition  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 
we may not be able to compete effectively with companies that integrate or bundle products similar to ours with their other product offerings 
many large  integrated software companies offer suites of products that include software applications for compliance and security management 
in addition  hardware vendors  including diversified  global concerns  offer products that address the compliance and security needs of the enterprises and government agencies that comprise 
table of contents our target market 
further  several companies currently sell software products that our customers and potential customers have broadly adopted  providing them a substantial advantage when they sell products that perform functions substantially similar to some of our products 
competitors that offer a large array of security or software products may be able to offer products or functionality similar to ours at a more attractive price than we can by integrating or bundling them with their other product offerings 
the consolidation in our industry increases the likelihood of competition based on integration or bundling 
customers may also increasingly seek to consolidate their enterprise level software purchases with a small number of larger companies that can purport to satisfy a broad range of their requirements 
if we are unable to sufficiently differentiate our products from the integrated or bundled products of our competitors  such as by offering enhanced functionality  performance or value  we may see a decrease in demand for our products  which would adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
similarly  if customers seek to concentrate their software purchases with a few large providers  we may be at a competitive disadvantage 
we have less experience with sale  manufacture  delivery  service and support of arcsight logger and our other appliance products and rely on a single contract manufacturer for manufacture and fulfillment of our appliance products  and as a result we may be unable to successfully forecast demand or fulfill orders for these appliance products 
we introduced our first arcsight logger product in fiscal prior to june  we offered only software products and related services  and as a result have less experience with sales of appliance based products than we have with our flagship esm products 
fulfillment of sales of our appliance products involves hardware manufacturing  inventory  import certification and return merchandise authorization processes with which we have less experience 
for example  if we fail to accurately predict demand and as a result our manufacturer maintains insufficient hardware inventory or excess inventory  we may be unable to timely deliver ordered products or may have substantial inventory expense 
as the size of individual orders increases  we may be unable to cause delivery of large unforecasted orders  particularly near the end of quarterly periods 
in addition  we use a single source for manufacture and fulfillment of our appliance products and if our equipment vendor fails to manufacture our appliance products or fulfill orders in required volumes  in a timely manner  at a sufficient level of quality  or at all  if it is no longer financially viable or for other reasons  we may be unable to fulfill customer orders and our operating results may fluctuate from period to period  particularly if a disruption occurs near the end of a fiscal period 
disruptions in the manufacture and fulfillment of our products could damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and result in revenue declines and a negative effect on our growth prospects 
in addition  if we change our hardware configuration or manufacturer  some countries may require us to reinitiate their import certification process 
if we are unable to successfully perform these functions or develop a relationship with a fulfillment partner that does so for us  our sales  operating results and financial condition may be harmed 
in addition  the process of obtaining additional or alternative capacity with another contract manufacturer would likely result in an increase of cost of goods sold  which could negatively impact our financial performance if we are unable to offset such increases with increases in the prices we charge our customers 
we face risks related to customer outsourcing to managed security service providers 
some of our customers have outsourced the management of their it departments or the network security operations function to large systems integrators or managed security service providers  or mssps 
if this trend continues our established customer relationships could be disrupted and our products could be displaced by alternative system and network protection solutions offered by systems integrators or mssps 
significant product displacements could impact our revenues and have a negative effect on our business 
while to date we have developed a number of successful relationships with mssps  they may develop or acquire their own technologies rather than purchasing our products for use in provision of managed security services 
seasonality may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
we believe that our product revenue has been somewhat seasonal historically  with the first quarter of our fiscal year typically having relatively lower product revenue  the second and third quarters of our fiscal year increasing 
table of contents from there and the fourth quarter of our fiscal year typically having relatively higher product revenue 
we believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors  including the fiscal year end procurement cycles of both our government and commercial customers  the budgeting  procurement and work cycles of our customers  including customers in the public sector  the timing of our annual sales club for top performers and annual training for our entire sales force in our first fiscal quarter  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in the united states  europe and certain other regions  sales to customers with a standard december fiscal year end that may positively impact our license revenue in the third quarter of our fiscal year  and the structure of our direct sales incentive and compensation program  which may reinforce the tendency of our direct sales team to book the largest volume of deals toward the end of our fiscal year 
the timing of our quarterly period boundaries and the us federal government s september fiscal year end may impact product sales to governmental agencies in the second quarter of our fiscal year  offsetting the otherwise seasonal downturn in later summer months 
we expect these seasonal factors to continue to impact our business in the future  and any seasonality that we experience may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
we believe that our rapid historical growth  the timing of the launch of new products and the timing of large product sales transactions near period boundaries  may have overshadowed the nature or magnitude of seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date 
they may do so again in the future 
seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially adversely affect our results of operations in the future 
our business depends  in part  on sales to the public sector  and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of the public sector could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we derive a portion of our revenues from contracts with federal  state  local and foreign governments and government agencies  and we believe that the success and growth of our business will continue to depend on our successful procurement of government contracts 
for example  we have historically derived  and expect to continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from sales to agencies of the us federal government  either directly by us or through systems integrators and other resellers 
in the fiscal years ended april   and  we derived  and of our revenues  respectively  from contracts with agencies of the us federal government 
accordingly changes in fiscal or contracting policies or decreases in available government funding  changes in government programs or applicable requirements  the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations  changes in political or social attitudes with respect to security issues  and potential delays or changes in the government appropriations process could cause governments and governmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing the products and services that we offer in the future or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to our business could cause us to lose us government customers or our ability to contract with the us government 
we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of us government contracts  which affect how we and our channel partners do business with us government agencies 
these laws and regulations may impose added costs on our business  and failure to comply with these or 
table of contents other applicable regulations and requirements  including non compliance in the past  could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners  and penalties  termination of contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting for a period of time with us government agencies 
any such damages  penalties  disruption or limitation in our ability to do business with the us government could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our government contracts may limit our ability to move development activities overseas and to source components from some countries  which may impair our ability to optimize our product development costs and compete for non government contracts 
increasingly  product development and component sourcing are being shifted to lower cost countries  such as india and china 
however  some contracts with us government agencies require that at least of the components of each of our products be of us origin or that each product be substantially transformed in the us or in a country on the us government s list of designated countries 
consequently  our ability to optimize our product development by conducting it overseas and to lower our costs of goods sold by sourcing from lower cost regions may be hampered 
some of our competitors do not rely on contracts with the us government to the same degree as we do and may develop product or source components offshore  or may have the scale to permit them to separately source versions of their competing products for sale to customers other than us government agencies 
if we are unable to develop product or source components as cost effectively as our competitors  our ability to compete for our non government customers may be reduced and our customer sales may decline  resulting in decreased revenues 
real or perceived errors  failures or bugs in our products could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects 
because we offer very complex products  undetected errors  failures or bugs may occur  especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released 
our products are often installed and used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems  system management software and equipment and networking configurations  which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors  failures or bugs in our products 
despite testing by us  errors  failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments 
in the past  we have discovered software errors  failures and bugs in some of our product offerings after their introduction 
in addition  our products could be perceived to be ineffective for a variety of reasons outside of our control 
hackers could circumvent our customers security measures  and customers may misuse our products resulting in a security breach or perceived product failure 
we provide a top level enterprise compliance and security management solution that integrates a wide variety of other elements in a customer s it and security infrastructure  and we may receive blame for a security breach that was the result of the failure of one of the other elements 
real or perceived errors  failures or bugs in our products could result in negative publicity  loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  loss of competitive position or claims by customers for losses sustained by them 
in such an event  we may be required  or may choose  for customer relations or other reasons  to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem 
our product liability insurance may not be adequate 
further  provisions in our license agreements with end users that limit our exposure to liabilities arising from such claims may not be enforceable in some circumstances or may not fully protect us against such claims and related liabilities and costs 
defending a lawsuit  regardless of its merit  could be costly and could limit the amount of time that management has available for day to day execution and strategic planning or other matters 
many of our end user customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other  less critical  software products 
in addition  if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our end user customer s systems  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed 
alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions  delays or cessation of our product 
table of contents licensing  which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects 
in addition  because we are a leading provider of enterprise security products and services  hackers and others may try to access our data or compromise our systems 
if we are the subject of a successful attack  then our reputation in the industry and with current and potential customers may be compromised and our sales and operating results could be adversely affected 
incorrect or improper use of our complex products  our failure to properly train customers on how to utilize our products or our failure to properly provide consulting and implementation services could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our results of operations and growth prospects 
our esm products are complex and are deployed in a wide variety of network environments 
the proper use of our products  particularly our esm products  requires training of the end user 
if our products are not used correctly or as intended  inadequate performance may result 
for example  among other things  deployment of our esm products requires categorization of it assets and assignment of business or criticality values for each  selection or configuration of one of our pre packaged rule sets  user interfaces and network utilization parameters  and deployment of connectors for the various devices and applications from which event data are to be collected 
our customers or our professional services personnel may incorrectly implement or use our products 
our products may also be intentionally misused or abused by customers or their employees or third parties who obtain access and use of our products 
similarly  our arcsight express product  and to a lesser extent our arcsight logger products  while less complex than our esm products  are often distributed through channel partners and sold to customers with smaller or less sophisticated it departments  potentially resulting in sub optimal installation and  consequently  performance that is less than the level anticipated by the end user 
because our customers rely on our product  service and maintenance offerings to manage a wide range of sensitive security  network and compliance functions  the incorrect or improper use of our products  our failure to properly train customers on how to efficiently and effectively use our products  our failure to properly provide consulting and implementation services and maintenance to our customers or our failure to properly provide soc services may result in negative publicity or legal claims against us 
in addition  if customer personnel are not well trained in the use of our products  customers may defer the deployment of our products  may deploy them in a more limited manner than originally anticipated or may not deploy them at all 
if there is substantial turnover of the customer personnel responsible for implementation and use of our products  our product may go unused and our ability to make additional sales may be substantially limited 
if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with our technology partners  we may not be able to support the interoperability of our software with a wide variety of security and other products and our business may be harmed 
a key feature of arcsight esm is that it provides out of the box support for many third party devices and applications that the customer may use in its business and technology infrastructure 
to provide effective interoperability  we work with individual product vendors to develop our smartconnectors  which allow our esm arcsight logger and arcsight express products to interface with third party products 
in addition  we are promoting the adoption of our common event format as a standard way to format system log events 
some of these technology partners are current or potential competitors of ours 
if we are unable to develop and maintain effective relationships with a wide variety of technology partners  if companies adopt more restrictive policies with respect to  or impose unfavorable terms and conditions on  access to their products  or if our common event format is not widely adopted  we may not be able to continue to provide our customers with a high degree of interoperability with their existing it and business infrastructure  which could reduce our sales and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results 
in fiscal years ended april   and  we derived  and of our revenues  respectively  from customers outside the united states  and we are continuing to expand our international operations as part of our growth strategy 
we currently have sales personnel and sales and support operations in australia  austria  brazil  canada  china  france  germany  hong kong  india  italy  japan  singapore  spain and the united kingdom 
our international operations subject us to a variety of risks  including increased management  travel  infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with having multiple international operations  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  especially in emerging markets  and the likelihood that revenues from international resellers and customers may need to be recognized when cash is received  at least until satisfactory payment history has been established  the need to localize our products and licensing programs for international customers  differing regulatory and legal requirements and possible enactment of additional regulations or restrictions on the use  import or export of encryption technologies and our appliance based products  which could delay or prevent the sale or use of our products in some jurisdictions  weaker protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  and overlapping of different tax regimes 
any of these risks could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales  adversely affecting our business  operating results and financial condition and growth prospects 
our business in countries with a history of corruption and transactions with foreign governments increase the risks associated with our international activities 
as we operate and sell internationally  we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act  or the fcpa  and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
we have operations  deal with and make sales to governmental or quasi governmental customers in countries known to experience corruption  particularly certain emerging countries in east asia  eastern europe and the middle east  and further expansion of our international selling efforts may involve additional regions  including africa  russia and south america 
our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees  consultants  sales agents or channel partners that could be in violation of various laws including the fcpa  even though these parties are not always subject to our control 
we have implemented safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees  consultants  sales agents and channel partners 
however  our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective  and our employees  consultants  sales agents or channel partners may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible 
violations of the fcpa may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions  including suspension or debarment from us government contracting  and we may be subject to other liabilities  which could negatively affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under patent and other intellectual property laws of the united states  so that we can prevent others from using our inventions and proprietary information 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately  our competitors might gain access to our technology  and our business might be harmed 
in addition  defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expenses 
any of our patents  copyrights  trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation 
we have seven issued patents and a number of patent applications pending in the united states  internationally and in specific foreign countries 
our issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be 
table of contents challenged by third parties  and our patent applications may never be granted at all 
additionally  the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time consuming  and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner 
even if issued  there can be no assurance that these patents will adequately protect our intellectual property  as the legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of patent and other intellectual property rights are uncertain 
any patents that are issued may subsequently be invalidated or otherwise limited  enabling other companies to better develop products that compete with ours  which could adversely affect our competitive business position  business prospects and financial condition 
in addition  issuance of a patent does not guarantee that we have a right to practice the patented invention 
patent applications in the us are typically not published until months after filing  or in some cases not at all  and publications of discoveries in industry related literature lag behind actual discoveries 
we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our issued patents or pending patent applications or otherwise used in our products  that we were the first to file for protection in our patent applications  or that third parties do not have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from marketing or practicing our patented products or technology 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products and services are available 
the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the united states  and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate 
accordingly  despite our efforts  we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 
we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights 
we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
any litigation  whether or not it is resolved in our favor  could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  which may adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information 
in order to protect our proprietary technology  processes and methods  we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners  employees  consultants  advisors and others 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
in addition  others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information  and in these cases we would not be able to assert any trade secret rights against those parties 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights  and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
we may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims  which are extremely costly to defend  could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies 
companies in the software  networking and technology industries  including some of our current and potential competitors  own large numbers of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
in addition  many of these companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them 
the litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues and against whom our potential patents may provide little or no deterrence 
we have received  and may in the future receive  notices that claim we have misappropriated or misused other parties intellectual property rights  and  to the extent we gain greater visibility  we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims  which is not uncommon with respect to software technologies in general and network security technology in particular 
there may be third party intellectual property rights  including issued or pending patents  that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods 
any intellectual property claims  with or without merit  could be very time consuming  could be expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management s attention and other resources 

table of contents these claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages  potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights 
these claims could also result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party s rights 
we might be required to seek a license for the intellectual property  which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
even if a license were available  we could be required to pay significant royalties  which would increase our operating expenses 
as a result  we may be required to develop alternative non infringing technology  which could require significant effort and expense 
if we cannot license or develop technology for any infringing aspect of our business  we would be forced to limit or stop sales of one or more of our products or product features and may be unable to compete effectively 
any of these results would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we rely on software licensed from other parties  the loss of which could increase our costs and delay software shipments 
we utilize various types of software licensed from unaffiliated third parties in order to provide certain elements of our product offering 
for example  we license database software from oracle that we integrate with our esm product 
our agreement with oracle permits us to distribute oracle software in our products to our customers and partners worldwide through may see the section entitled item business intellectual property oracle license agreement 
any errors or defects in this third party software could result in errors that could harm our business 
in addition  licensed software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
while we believe that there are currently adequate replacements for third party software  any loss of the right to use any of this software could result in delays in producing or delivering our software until equivalent technology is identified and integrated  which delays could harm our business 
our business would be disrupted if any of the software we license from others or functional equivalents of this software were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms 
in either case  we would be required to either redesign our products to function with software available from other parties or to develop these components ourselves  which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in our product shipments and the release of new product offerings 
furthermore  we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future products 
if we fail to maintain or renegotiate any of these software licenses  we could face significant delays and diversion of resources in attempting to license and integrate a functional equivalent of the software 
some of our products contain open source software  and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 
certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses 
some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software  and that we license these modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use 
if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner  we could  under certain provisions of the open source licenses  be required to release the source code of our proprietary software 
in addition to risks related to license requirements  usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software  as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software 
we have established processes to help alleviate these risks  including a review process for screening requests from our development organization for the use of open source software  and we plan to implement the use of software tools to review our source code for potential inclusion of open source software  but we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products or that such software tools will be effective 
in addition  open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated  and could  if not properly addressed  negatively affect our business 
if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software  we may be required to re engineer our products  to release proprietary source code  to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts  any of which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses 
our agreements with customers and channel partners include indemnification provisions  under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement and  in some cases  for damages caused by us to property or persons 
the term of these indemnity provisions is generally perpetual after execution of the corresponding product sale agreement 
large indemnity payments could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
changes or reforms in the law or regulatory landscape could diminish the demand for our solutions  and could have a negative impact on our business 
one factor that drives demand for our products and services is the legal and regulatory framework in which our customers operate 
laws and regulations are subject to drastic changes  and these could either help or hurt the demand for our products 
thus  some changes in the law and regulatory landscape  such as legislative reforms that limit corporate compliance obligations  could significantly harm our business 
if we are unable to attract and retain personnel  our business would be harmed 
we depend on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key personnel  in particular tom reilly and hugh njemanze  the loss of whom could harm our business 
all of our executive officers and key employees are at will employees  which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time 
we do not maintain a key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or other employees 
our future success also depends on our ability to identify  attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  finance and other personnel  particularly in our sales and marketing  research and development and professional service departments 
we face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous security  software and other technology companies 
in addition  competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters are located 
often  significant amounts of time and resources are required to train technical  sales and other personnel 
qualified individuals are in high demand 
we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them  and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other technology companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them 
we may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing technical  operational and managerial requirements  on a timely basis or at all  and we may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so 
if we are unable to attract and retain the qualified personnel we need to succeed  our business would suffer 
volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees 
many of our senior management personnel and other key employees have become  or will soon become  vested in a substantial amount of stock or stock options 
employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the options  or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly above the market price of our common stock 
if we are unable to retain our employees  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
if we fail to manage future growth effectively  our business would be harmed 
we operate in an emerging market and have experienced  and may continue to experience  significant expansion of our operations 
in particular  we grew from employees as of april  to employees as of april  this growth has placed  and will continue to place  a strain on our employees  management systems and other resources 
managing our growth will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources 
if we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 

table of contents future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations 
we have expanded by acquisition in the past  and we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future  any of which could be material to our business  operating results and financial condition 
our ability as an organization to successfully acquire and integrate technologies or businesses on a larger scale is unproven 
acquisitions involve many risks  including the following an acquisition may negatively impact our results of operations because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or liabilities  may cause adverse tax consequences  substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges  may result in acquired in process research and development expenses or in the future may require the amortization  write down or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation  goodwill and other intangible assets  or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs  we may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures in integrating the business  technologies  products  personnel or operations of any company that we acquire  particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us  an acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business  divert resources  increase our expenses and distract our management  an acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of customer purchases for both us and the company acquired due to customer uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of service from either company  we may encounter difficulties in  or may be unable to  successfully sell any acquired products  and an acquisition may involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired 
as a public company  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act  the sarbanes oxley act of  or the sarbanes oxley act  and the rules and regulations of the nasdaq stock market 
we expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal  accounting and financial compliance costs  make some activities more difficult  time consuming and costly and place undue strain on our personnel  systems and resources 
the sarbanes oxley act requires  among other things  that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
we are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the sec is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec s rules and forms 
our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  and the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
further  weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future 
any failure to develop or maintain effective controls  or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our prior period financial statements 
any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports filed with the sec under section of the sarbanes oxley act 
ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information  which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  we have expended  and anticipate that we will continue to expend  significant resources and provide significant management oversight  which involve substantial accounting related costs 
any 
table of contents failure to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis  could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business 
in the event that we are not able to continue to demonstrate compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act in a timely manner  that our internal controls are perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements  investors may lose confidence in our operating results and our stock price could decline 
in addition  if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements  we may not be able to remain listed on the nasdaq global market 
we have not yet implemented a complete disaster recovery plan or business continuity plan for our accounting and related information technology systems 
any disaster could therefore materially impair our ability to maintain timely accounting and reporting 
we may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carry forwards  which could adversely affect our operating results 
due to prior period losses  we have generated significant federal and state net operating loss carry forwards  which expire beginning in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
us federal and state income tax laws limit the amount of these carry forwards we can utilize upon a greater than cumulative shift of stock ownership over a three year period  including shifts due to the issuance of additional shares of our common stock  or securities convertible into our common stock 
we have previously experienced a greater than shift in our stock ownership  which has limited our ability to use a portion of our net operating loss carry forwards  and we may experience subsequent shifts in our stock ownership 
accordingly  there is a risk that our ability to use our existing carry forwards in the future could be further limited and that existing carry forwards would be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities  adversely affecting our operating results 
governmental export or import controls could subject us to liability or limit our ability to compete in foreign markets 
our products incorporate encryption technology and may be exported outside the us only if we obtain an export license or qualify for an export license exception 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products  including new releases of our products  may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets  prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or  in some cases  prevent the export of our products to some countries altogether 
in addition  various countries regulate the import of our appliance based products and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute products or could limit our customers ability to implement our products in those countries 
any new export or import restrictions  new legislation or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations  or in the countries  persons or technologies targeted by such regulations  could result in decreased use of our products by existing customers with international operations  declining adoption of our products by new customers with international operations and decreased revenues 
if we fail to comply with export and import regulations  we may be denied export privileges  be subjected to fines or other penalties and our products may be denied entry into other countries 
risks related to ownership of our common stock our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance 
the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  the financial projections we may provide to the public  any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections  failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us  changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company  or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors  
table of contents ratings or other changes by any securities analysts who follow our company or our industry  announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally  or those in our industry in particular  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market  including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole  such as the recent and continuing unprecedented volatility in the financial markets  lawsuits threatened or filed against us  and other events or factors  including those resulting from war  incidents of terrorism or responses to these events 
in addition  the stock markets  and in particular the nasdaq global market on which our common stock is listed  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies  particularly technology companies 
broad market fluctuations such as these may have and could continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
even prior to the recent unprecedented volatility in the financial markets  stock prices of many technology companies had fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
in the past  stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility 
if we were to become involved in securities litigation  it could subject us to substantial costs  divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
we currently have limited  and may not obtain additional  research coverage by securities analysts  and industry analysts that currently cover us may cease to do so 
if no securities analysts commence coverage of our company  or if industry analysts cease coverage of our company  the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted 
in the event we obtain securities analyst coverage  if one or more of the analysts who cover us or our industry downgrade our stock or the stock of other companies in our industry  or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or industry  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly  demand for our stock could decrease  which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 
delaware law  provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the concentration of our ownership could make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest difficult  thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock 
we are a delaware corporation and the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders 
in addition  our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors  including the following our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three year terms  only our chief executive officer  our president  our lead independent director  a majority of our board of directors or our chairman of the board  if any none currently  is authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders  our stockholders are only able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent  vacancies on our board of directors are able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders  
table of contents directors may be removed from office only for cause  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock  the terms of which may be established  and shares of which may be issued  without stockholder approval  and advance notice procedures will apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders 
in addition  as of july  including options exercisable by those holders within days of that date  our directors and executive officers  together with their affiliates  beneficially own in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock 
further  holders that together with their affiliates hold or more of our common stock  but who are not affiliated with our directors and executive officers  beneficially own in the aggregate an additional of our outstanding common stock as of that date 
as a result  our directors and officers and their affiliates  collectively  or our largest stockholders  acting together  may be able to practically prevent or impede a merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets

table of contents revenues in fiscal and prior years were impacted by revenues related to multiple element sales transactions consummated for which the revenues were deferred because we did not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  for some product elements that were not delivered in the fiscal year of the transaction 
following identification in mid fiscal of transactions with such undelivered elements  with respect to some of these transactions  we and our customers amended the contractual terms to remove the undelivered product elements and in other instances we have since delivered such product elements 
the net impact of these transactions reduced revenues in fiscal by million and increased revenues in fiscal  and by million  million and million  respectively

we also provide complementary software that delivers pre packaged analytics and reports tailored to specific compliance and security initiatives  as well as appliances that streamline event log archiving 
we were founded in may and first sold our initial esm product in june we initially funded our operations primarily through convertible preferred stock financings that raised a total of million 
our revenues have grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in february  we completed our ipo  in which we sold  shares of common stock  at an issue price of per share 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds from our ipo  or million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts of million and offering expenses of million 
we achieved positive cash flows from operations in fiscal through we generated million of cash from our operating activities during fiscal  and we generally expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities on an annual basis 
as of april   we had cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable of million  and an aggregate of million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
important factors affecting our operating results and financial condition we believe that the market for our products is in the early stages of development 
we have identified factors that we expect to play an important role in our future growth and profitability 
these factors are sales of esm products and appliance products to new customers 
the market for compliance and security management software solutions is growing  with new purchases often driven by corporate compliance initiatives 
we typically engage in a proof of concept with our customers to demonstrate the capabilities of our esm products in their specific environment 
a new sale usually involves the sale of licenses for one or more esm managers  licenses for the number and type of devices the customer intends to manage with arcsight esm  licenses for our console and web interfaces  installation services  training and an initial maintenance arrangement 
in many cases  customers will also purchase one of our complementary software modules which enable them to implement specific sets of off the shelf rules for our event correlation engine that address 
table of contents specific compliance and security issues and business risks 
in addition  customers may purchase our arcsight logger appliances to address their log archiving needs 
our continued increase in the number of new customers is partly a result of sales of our arcsight logger products to mid market companies 
a key component of our growth will depend on our ability to sell our products to new customers 
we also anticipate that a growing proportion of future new customers will be a result of initial sales of arcsight logger  our new arcsight express product and our other products sold in an appliance form factor 
continued sales to our installed base 
many customers make an initial purchase from us and then decide whether to use our products with respect to a larger portion of their business and technology infrastructure or buy additional complementary products from us 
thus  a key component of our growth will be our ability to successfully maintain and further develop the relationships with our existing customers 
development and introduction of new products 
we believe it is important that we continue to develop or acquire new products and services that will help us capitalize on opportunities in the compliance and security management market 
examples of new product introductions in fiscal included our compliance insight package for nerc cip standards and our arcsight express product 
we continue the enhancement of our esm products and solutions  such as the introduction of esm appliances in june  the integration with the cisco mobility services engine announced in may  and the introduction of an all in one pci log management appliance in july and arcsight logger in september in addition  we continue to develop and release appliance versions of our software products and updates to complementary solution packages for our arcsight logger product 
development of our channel network 
historically  we have sold our products primarily through our direct sales force  with sales to government or international purchasers through resellers and systems integrators 
we recently expanded our sales channel to assist us in penetrating the mid market  particularly as we expanded our appliance based offerings 
we believe that our current and any new appliance based products that we develop will be sold more effectively through resellers and  if we are successful in introducing these new products  we will become more dependent on the development of an effective channel network 
further training  certification and development of our existing channel partners will be a key factor in the success of this strategy 
sources of revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses our sales transactions typically include the following elements a software license fee paid for the use of our products in perpetuity or  in limited circumstances  for a specified term  an arrangement for first year support and maintenance  which includes unspecified software updates and upgrades  and professional services for installation  implementation and training 
we derive the majority of our revenues from sales of software products 
we introduced complementary appliance products in fiscal we sell our products and services primarily through our direct sales force 
additionally  we utilize resellers and systems integrators  particularly in sales to government agencies and international customers 
we recognize revenues pursuant to american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements  or collectively  sop  which  if revenues are to be recognized upon product delivery  requires among other things vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  for each undelivered element of multiple element customer contracts 
revenues in fiscal and prior years were impacted by multiple element sales transactions consummated for which the revenues were deferred because we did not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  for some product elements that were not delivered in the fiscal year of the transaction 
following identification in mid fiscal of transactions with such undelivered elements  with respect to some of these transactions  we and our customers amended the contractual terms to remove the undelivered product elements and in other instances we have since delivered such product elements 
the net impact of these transactions reduced revenues in fiscal by million and increased revenues in fiscal  and by million  million and million  respectively 
in each case  the net impact caused our fiscal period to period revenue growth rate to appear lesser or greater  as applicable  than it otherwise would
