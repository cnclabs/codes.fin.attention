exchange point services we enable our customers to exchange internet and other data traffic through direct connection with each other or through peering connections with multiple parties 
our business is characterized by long term contracts  which provide for monthly recurring revenue from a diversified customer base 
our customer contracts are generally years in duration and our average quarterly revenue churn rate for the past four quarters has been less than and we experienced no revenue churn in our federal customer base  which we believe is a reflection of the value of our integrated technology solutions and our ability to deliver the highest quality service 
as an illustration of this principle  during the year ended march   approximately of our overall revenue was recurring and over of our new bookings were derived from existing customers 
our principal executive office is located at south biscayne boulevard  suite  miami  florida our telephone number is critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and allowance for bad debt  derivatives  accounting for income taxes  goodwill  impairment of long lived assets  and share based compensation 
revenue recognition and allowance for bad debts revenues principally consist of monthly recurring fees for colocation  exchange point  managed and professional services fees 
colocation revenues also include monthly rental income for unconditioned space in the nap of the americas 
revenues from colocation  exchange point services  and hosting  as well as rental income for unconditioned space  are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
installation fees and related direct costs are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected life of the customer installation which is estimated to be to months 
managed and professional services are recognized in the period in which the services are provided 
revenues also include equipment resales which are generally recognized in the period in which the equipment is delivered  title transfers and is accepted by the customer 
revenue from contract settlements is generally recognized when collectability is reasonably assured and no remaining performance obligation exists 
taxes collected from customers and remitted to the government are excluded from revenues 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  when more than one element such as equipment  installation and colocation services 
table of contents are contained in a single arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on acceptable fair value allocation methodologies  provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the fair value of the undelivered elements is determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately  or in cases when the item is not sold separately  by using other acceptable objective evidence 
management applies judgment to ensure appropriate application of eitf  including the determination of whether delivered items have standalone value and the determination of fair value for the multiple deliverables  among others 
for those arrangements where the deliverables do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  revenue from all deliverables are treated as one accounting unit and recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from the customers 
if we determine that collectability is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we sell certain third party service contracts and software assurance or subscription products and evaluate whether the subsequent sales of such services should be recorded as gross revenues or net revenues in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria outlined in staff accounting bulletin no 
 eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
we determine whether our role is that of a principal in the transaction and therefore assumes the risks and rewards of ownership or if our role is acting as an agent or broker 
under gross revenue recognition  the entire selling price is recorded as revenue and the cost to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded as cost of revenues  product and services 
under net revenue recognition  the cost to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction of revenue resulting in net revenue equal to the gross profit on the transaction and there is no cost of revenue 
we analyze current economic news and trends  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
our customer contracts generally require us to meet certain service level commitments 
if we do not meet required service levels  we may be obligated to provide credits  usually a month of free service 
derivatives in the past  we have used financial instruments  including interest cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements  to manage exposures to movements in interest rates 
the use of these financial instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce the risk or cost to us 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we entered into two interest rate swap agreements as required under the provisions of our aggregate million first and second lien credit facilities entered into on july  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our senior convertible notes  due june   the senior convertible notes  senior convertible notes  due june   the senior convertible notes and senior subordinated convertible notes  due june   the series b notes collectively  the notes contain embedded derivatives that require valuation separate from the notes 
we recognize these derivatives as assets or liabilities on our balance sheet  measure them at their estimated fair value  and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in earnings in the period of change 
we estimate the fair value of the notes respective embedded derivatives using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop 
table of contents the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we may eventually pay to settle these embedded derivatives 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income 
effective april   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
as amended accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with fasb no 
and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
fin requires that we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions will more likely than not be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
the provisions of fin also provide guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosure 
in connection with the adoption of fin no 
 we analyzed the filing positions in all of the federal  state and foreign jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
the adoption of fin resulted in no cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle being recorded on our consolidated financial statements during the year ended march  in accordance with fin  we continued its policy of recognizing penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions  if any  in general and administrative expenses 
we have not been audited by the internal revenue service or any other tax authorities for the following open tax periods the quarter ended march   and the years ended march    and net operating loss carryovers incurred in years prior to are subject to audit in the event they are utilized in subsequent years 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not amortized and are instead tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step approach 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying amount 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed 
the second step involves a comparison of the implied fair value and carrying value of that reporting unit s goodwill 
to the extent that a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized 
identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives 
as of march  and  our goodwill totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
goodwill represents the carrying amount of the excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in conjunction with i the april acquisition of a corporation holding rights to develop and manage facilities catering to the telecommunications industry  ii the september acquisition of a managed hosting services provider in europe  iii the may acquisition of a managed hosting services provider in the united states and iv the january acquisition of a disaster recovery and business continuity provider in the united states 
we performed the annual test for impairment for the goodwill in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended march  and concluded there was no impairment 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  but are not limited to  
table of contents prolonged industry downturns  significant decline in our market value and significant reductions in our projected cash flows 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of profit margins  terminal growth rates and discounted rates 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
as of march  and  our long lived assets  including property and equipment  net and identifiable intangible assets  totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
the fair value of stock option and nonvested stock awards with only service conditions  which are subject to graded vesting  are expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the awards 
tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of share based compensation expense recognized under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheets 
realized tax shortfalls are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits  if any  and then charged directly to income tax expense

table of contents change in fair value of derivatives 
for the year ended march   we recognized an expense of million mainly due to the changes in the fair value of our embedded derivatives and the fair value of our two interest rate hedge agreements 
our senior convertible notes and our series b notes contain embedded derivatives that require separate valuation 
we recognize these embedded derivatives as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet  measure them at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative instruments in earnings 
the embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on changes in price and volatility of our common stock 
the estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives increase as the price of our common stock increases and decreases as the price of our common stock decreases 
the company has estimated that the embedded derivatives related to the equity participation rights and the takeover make whole premium do not have significant value 
the early conversion incentive expired on june  as a result  the company reclassified million of these embedded derivatives  classified as liabilities  to additional paid in capital 
this amount represented the fair value of such embedded derivatives at the time of the expiration of the early conversion incentive 
we recognized income of million from the change in estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives prior to the expiration of the early conversion incentive and we recognized million expense for the year ended march  related to the fair valuation of the series b embedded derivative which is our only remaining embedded derivative at march  we do not expect the changes in fair value of the embedded derivative associated with our series b notes to have a significant effect on the results of our operations 
on february   we entered into two interest rate hedge agreements  in accordance with the provisions of the senior secured credit facilities 
one of the interest rate hedge agreements was effective march  for a notional amount of million and a fixed interest rate of 
interest payments on this hedge are due on the last day of each march  june  september and december commencing on june  and ending on december  the second interest rate hedge agreement entered into is effective on july  for a notional amount of million and a fixed interest rate of 
interest payments on this hedge are due on the last day of each january  april  july and october commencing on october  and ending on january  the interest rate swap agreements serve as an economic hedge against increases in interest rates and have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
accordingly  we are accounting for these interest rate hedge agreements on a fair value basis and as a result these instruments are adjusted to fair value and the resulting changes in fair value are charged to earnings 
included in the million change in fair value of derivative expense  for the year ended march   is a million charge related to the fair value of the two interest rate hedge agreements we entered into in connection with our senior secured credit facilities 
for the year ended march   we recognized income of million from the change in estimated fair value of derivatives 
financing charges and other 
for the year ended march   we expensed million of financing charges and other expense consisting of title and legal fees 
these charges were expensed after determining that our new term loan of million was not a substantial modification of our existing debt instruments 
early extinguishment of debt and net loss 
net loss increased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  this increase is primarily due to a non cash loss on the early extinguishment of debt of million for the year ended march  liquidity and capital resources as of march   our principal source of liquidity was our million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and our million in accounts receivable 
additionally  in accordance with a subscription agreement dated may   we closed on the sale and issuance of  shares of our common stock to vmware bermuda limited for an aggregated purchase price of million 
for the year ended march   we generated approximately million of cash flows from operations 
we anticipate that the remaining cash coupled with our anticipated cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditures  working capital  debt service and corporate overhead requirements in connection with our currently identified business objectives for the same period 
consequently  we expect to maintain our current liquidity and be able to repay the convertible debt due in june with an aggregate principal value of approximately million 
table of contents while remaining in compliance with the terms of the first and second lien agreements which prohibit us from having cash and cash equivalents less than million at any time 
we are anticipating capital expenditures for the year ended march  to be approximately million  with the majority related to the second phase of our data center campus in culpeper  virginia as well as upgrades to support our infrastructure and expansion in miami  florida 
additionally  in accordance with our business strategy  we may from time to time make further capital expenditures to build out our existing facilities  when the demand for our services is established  where there are significant opportunities to grow revenue and the probability of success is significant 
our projected revenues and cash flows depend on several factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the rate at which we provide services  the timing of exercise of expansion options by customers under existing contracts  the rate at which new services are sold to the federal sector and the commercial sector  the ability to retain the customer base  the willingness and timing of potential customers in outsourcing the housing and management of their technology infrastructure to us  the reliability and cost effectiveness of our services and our ability to market our services 
besides our cash on hand and any financing activities we may pursue  customer collections are our primary source of cash 
while we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past  if the current market conditions continue to deteriorate we may experience increased churn in our customer base  including reductions in their commitments to us  which could also have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
sources and uses of cash cash provided by operations for the year ended march  was million as compared to cash used in operations of million for the year ended march  the increase in cash provided by operations is mainly due to a decrease in our net loss and the timing of vendor payments and collections from customers 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended march  was million compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended march   a decrease of million 
this decrease is primarily due to the cash used in the acquisition of a managed web hosting provider in may offset by higher capital expenditures mostly related to our expansion in culpeper  virginia  upgrades to our infrastructure and expansion in miami  florida  and santa clara  california  during the year ended march  cash used in financing activities for the year ended march  was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended march   a decrease of million 
this decrease in cash in financing activities is primarily due to the proceeds received from our million term financing arrangement  dated july   during the year ended march   offset by million in repayments of old notes and mortgage payables and million in debt issuance costs during the year ended march  in addition  we issued  shares of our common stock in april  pursuant to the underwriter s exercise of their over allotment option of the  shares we sold in our march offering 
debt obligations as of march   our total liabilities was approximately million of which million is due within one year

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at march   our exposure to market risk related primarily to changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio 
our marketable investments consist primarily of short term fixed interest rate securities 
we invest only with high credit quality issuers and we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not believe that a significant increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
we have not entered into any financial instruments for trading purposes  however  the estimated fair value of the derivatives embedded within our senior convertible notes  senior convertible notes  and series b notes create a market risk exposure resulting from changes in the price of our common stock  interest rates and our credit rating 
we do not expect significant changes in the near term in the two year historical volatility of our common stock used to calculate the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives 
we do not expect the change in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative to significantly affect our results of operations and it will not impact our cash flows 
our senior convertible notes  senior convertible notes and our senior secured notes have fixed interest rates and  accordingly  are not exposed to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
the interest on the senior secured credit facilities is determined based on an adjusted eurodollar rate plus basis points  in the case of the first lien agreement  and basis points  in the case of the second lien agreement  or at a rate based on the federal funds rate plus basis points  in the case of the first lien agreement  or basis points  in the case of the second lien agreement  at our election 
on february   we entered into two interest rate hedge agreements  in accordance with the provisions of the senior secured credit facilities 
one of the interest rate hedge agreements was effective march  for a notional amount of million and a fixed interest rate of 
interest payments on this hedge are due on the last day of each march  june  september and december commencing on june  and ending on december  the second interest rate hedge agreement entered into is effective on july  for a notional amount of million and a fixed interest rate of 
interest payments on this hedge are due on the last day of each january  april  july and october commencing on october  and ending on january  the interest rate swap agreements serve as an economic hedge against increases in interest rates and have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
for the year ended march   approximately of our recognized revenue has been denominated in us dollars  generated mostly from customers in the us  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations has been minimal 
in the future  a larger portion of our revenues may be derived from operations outside of the us and may be denominated in foreign currency 
as a result  future operating results or cash flows could be impacted due to currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent we engage in international sales that are denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in the international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot conclude that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
some of our operating costs are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices 
the commodity most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of significant price change is electricity 
we are closely monitoring the cost of electricity 
to the extent that electricity costs rise  we have the ability to pass these additional power costs onto our customers that utilize this power 
we do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk
