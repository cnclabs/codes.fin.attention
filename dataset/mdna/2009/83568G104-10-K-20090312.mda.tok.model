item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of sonosite  inc md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our business strategy is to lead in the design  development and commercialization of high performance  innovative ultrasound technology and hcu systems 
we intend to sustain long term growth of our business through technological innovation  broadening of sales distribution channels  entry and maintenance of strategic relationships  expanding into new clinical and geographic markets  and delivering high quality products to customers 
we are focusing on the development of innovative products with the objective of improving patient care and efficiency through ease of use  high performance imaging  and providing quicker results to physicians and clinicians 
we also investing in research and development in existing and new lines of business and other areas that we believe may contribute to our long term growth 
recognizing that one of our greatest challenges is the current state of the global economy  we are focused on increasing sales force efficiency and effective cost management 
over the last few years  we have laid a foundation for long term growth by introducing innovative products  entering into strategic relationships  expanding into new markets  and providing high quality products with an industry leading year warranty 
in fiscal year  we plan to continue to build on this foundation and to execute well in key areas  including continuing to innovate using existing and new technologies  to build and maintain key relationships in the sales distribution channels  to improve sales force productivity  to deliver high quality products  and to manage expenses 
key opportunities include the following product innovation our products provide exceptional reliability  image quality  and ease of use in a lightweight design that can be either hand carried  used on a stand or mounted on a wall or from a ceiling 
we are committed to continuing to develop our next generation of products and expanding our existing product base by using new and existing technologies 
fiscal year saw a broad adoption of the m turbo and s series ultrasound tools that were introduced at the end of and during strategic relationships we are focused on building relationships that will enable us to continue to develop markets within ultrasound or with ultrasound dependent technologies 
we believe that these relationships can accelerate market penetration to customers not served by our direct sales force 
acquisitions we intend to continue exploring the possible acquisition of one or more medical device companies in an effort to expand our product portfolio and our sales channels  create international operating leverage  improve marketing and other efficiencies  and leverage manufacturing and supply chain economics 
results of operations our financial performance during reflected an increase in revenue  operating income  and cash flow 
the introduction of m turbo and s series tm product lines in late provided strong revenue growth 
we were able to demonstrate operating leverage despite the challenging worldwide economy 
revenue revenue increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was attributable to the full year of sales of m turbo systems  which has a higher average selling price than the micromaxx system  and s series ultrasound tools  expansion of 
table of contents our international sales channels  improved us sales productivity  offset by a reduction in sales of earlier products 
the increase in compared to was due to the introduction of new products in the fourth quarter of and increased sales of micromaxx systems offset by a reduction in sales of earlier products 
changes in exchange rates had a positive impact on revenue in and had a positive impact on revenue in united states us revenue increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was attributable to increased sales of new products and increased sales productivity 
the increase in compared to was primarily attributable to increased sales in both hospitals and office channels 
international revenue from europe  africa and the middle east increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to new products and expansion of our sales channel  partially offset by an unfavorable exchange impact of 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in revenue from direct sales in the uk  france and spain offset by decreases in direct sales to italy  which became a direct sales subsidiary in september  and in germany 
revenue from latin america and canada increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was due to increased sales in latin america attributable to expansion of the sales channel  partially offset by an unfavorable exchange impact of 
the increase in compared to was due to a significant increase in canada due to the sales force expansion and expansion of the dealer network in latin america 
revenue from asia pacific increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was due to increased sales in australia attributable to new products and a favorable exchange impact of 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to the expansion of the sales force 
fiscal year outlook given the turmoil in the global economy  we are unable to predict whether our revenues will increase in compared to we expect to introduce new products and features  to develop the us physicians office market  and to expand our international operations 
the expansion of our international markets  as well as the development of the us hospital and physician office markets  considering current economic conditions  may not be as successful as anticipated and we may encounter regulatory and other issues in selling our products 
our revenue may also be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in the countries in which we sell our products 
increased competition may also impact our anticipated growth in revenue 
we currently face competition from larger companies that manufacture cart based and portable ultrasound systems and have greater financial and other resources 
gross margin gross margin remained at in compared to in and in gross margin remained consistent in compared to primarily as a result of the increase in warranty expense  resulting from a shift to products with five year warranties from products with one year warranties  which was offset by the reduction in royalties to atl  which had expired in september  reduction of material costs  and  favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
the decrease in compared to was impacted negatively from the increased sales to our distributor network and transitioning of sales from micromaxx to the new products  offset by the reduction in royalties to atl and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates 

table of contents fiscal year outlook increased competition from existing and new competitors as well as pricing pressure due to economic conditions could result in lower average realized prices and could lower our gross margin 
our gross margin can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based on the mix of business between direct  government and distributor sales  mix of us and international sales  and our product and accessories sales mixes 
changes in our cost of inventory also may impact our gross margin 
adjustments to reduce carrying costs are recorded for obsolete material  earlier generation products and used or refurbished products held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product 
if market conditions change or the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to further write down the carrying value of our inventory  resulting in a negative impact on gross margins 
we rely on our sales forecasts by product to determine production volume 
to the extent our sales forecasts or product mix estimates are inaccurate  we may produce excess inventory or experience inventory shortages  which may result in an increase in our costs of revenue  a decrease in our gross margin or lost sales 
our gross margin may also be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
operating expenses research and development expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was due to development of future new products and features  and further development related to the m turbo system and s series ultrasound tools 
the increase in compared to was due to increased headcount for development of the m turbo system and s series ultrasound tools  which were released in  and for future new products and features 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was attributable to increased headcount to support business growth  increased incentive compensation related to improved financial performance  increased stock based compensation  increased legal costs related to our patent litigation  increased severance and acquisition costs  and the elimination of overhead within the company s marketing  general and administrative structure 
the increase in compared to was attributable to the expansion of international sales operations  continued growth in the office by our sales channel partner  increased efforts in education and training  and increased legal costs related to our patent litigation 
fiscal year outlook we anticipate that operating expenses will decrease in compared to through effective cost management 
other income  net total other income was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily attributable to the gain recognized on the partial repurchase of our convertible senior notes during the fourth quarter  partially offset by a decrease in interest income  resulting from lower interest rates  higher interest expense  resulting from the first full year of outstanding convertible debt  and foreign currency losses 
the increase in compared to was due to increased interest income  resulting from higher cash and investment balances  and higher foreign currency gains  offset by interest expense from our convertible senior notes 
fiscal year outlook we anticipate that other income will decrease in as we do not expect to repurchase the same amount of convertible senior notes and will incur additional interest expense as a result of the adoption of fsp no 
apb see recent accounting pronouncements for additional discussion on the adoption of fsp no 
apb 
table of contents income tax expense income tax expense was million in  million in  and million in due to our profitable operations in  and  we recorded income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and accordingly reflected changes in our deferred tax assets 
the income tax expense is based on a blended federal and state rate applied to us income and the applicable foreign rates applied to foreign income 
the increase in our consolidated effective tax rate in  as compared to  results primarily from non deductible expense associated with a contingent liability incurred as part of the lumenvu acquisition  a tax assessment resulting from an income tax audit in a non us jurisdiction  an increase in executive compensation subject to internal revenue code section m limitations and the impact of reaching the maximum federal marginal tax rate 
in we utilized our net operating losses nols and alternative minimum tax credits carried forward from and a portion of research and development tax credits 
foreign nols will be utilized in jurisdictions where they are available and cash will be paid in jurisdictions that do not have foreign nols 
during the fourth quarter of  we reversed the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets primarily representing net operating losses from our international operations  resulting in a reduction of million to our income tax provision 
we did not reverse the valuation allowance until it was more likely than not that the tax asset would be realized 
we assess our ability to realize our tax credit carryforwards in future periods and record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
in addition  we reduce the deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol carryforwards utilized currently as well as the reversing effect of temporary differences 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments and charges 
fiscal year outlook we anticipate that our effective tax rate in will remain comparable to fiscal year liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market accounts 
our short term and long term investment securities totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december  investment securities generally consist of high grade us government and corporate debt 
we have the ability to hold our securities until maturity  however  we classify all securities as available for sale  as the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity to implement management strategies 
as of december   we had million in the columbia strategic cash portfolio  which is in the process of liquidation 
in our judgment this investment  which is classified as a money market account  has experienced a decline in fair value that is other than temporary  accordingly we have recognized an impairment loss of million in and million in distributions from this portfolio are solely at the discretion of the portfolio manager 
we anticipate that million will be distributed from this portfolio during  which is recorded as a short term investment  and million will be distributed after  which is recorded as a long term investment 
operating activities provided cash of million in  compared to cash provided of million in and million in the increase of cash provided in compared to was primarily due to improved operations and reduced spending on inventory and prepaid assets  partially offset by a reduction in payables 
the comparison of cash provided in compared to was primarily due to increases in accrued expenses  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
investing activities provided cash of million in  compared to million used in and million used in the increase in cash provided in compared to cash used in was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from sales of investment securities of million and lower acquisition 
table of contents costs of million 
the increase in cash used in compared to was due to the net purchases of investment securities of million and our acquisition of lumenvu of million 
financing activities used cash of million in  provided million in and provided million in cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of million in repurchases of senior convertible notes and the associated warrant repurchases  partially offset by the sale of call options for million and the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan totaling million 
this compared to proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt of million in  offset by the purchase of the call option intended to partially hedge our convertible note for million and issuance of warrants for million  and the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan totaling million in and million in fiscal year outlook we believe that our existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures in nevertheless  we may experience an increased need for additional cash in order to complete future acquisitions 
our ability to provide cash from operations will depend on our ability to successfully sell our products  collect our receivables  control our inventories and manage our expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements during the year ended and as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  other than obligations under our operating leases reflected in the contractual obligations table below 
we are not a party to any derivative transactions except for certain foreign exchange rate hedging transactions that we enter into from time to time  discussed more fully under foreign currency risk in item a below and the call option and warrant instruments indexed to our common stock 
we provide i indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers and distributors against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products  ii indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers against third party claims arising as a result of defects in our products  iii indemnifications of varying scope and size to consultants against third party claims arising from the services they provide to us  and iv guarantees to support obligations of some of our subsidiaries such as lease payments 
these indemnifications and guarantees require only disclosure 
to date  we have not incurred material costs as a result of these obligations and do not expect to incur material costs in the future 
accordingly  we have not accrued any liabilities in our consolidated financial statements related to these indemnifications or guarantees 
contractual obligations we have the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations long term debt obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations includes interest of on convertible senior notes contingent purchase consideration for the acquisition of lumenvu inc the consideration is contingent upon achieving milestones related to the technology acquired from lumenvu 

table of contents in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  we have million of unrecognized tax benefits reflected as either liabilities or as a reduction of deferred tax assets  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
other commitments in june  we committed to donating of our systems and two probes per system per year over a four year period to a research university 
our contributions to the university will commence in in  we entered into an agreement to contribute up to million to a research university 
this pledge  which is to be paid over a four year period  is conditioned upon our election to make a payment on an annual basis 
we expensed million in  million in and million in for this arrangement 
as part of our agreements with our suppliers  suppliers may procure resources and material expected to be used for the manufacture of our products in accordance with our production schedule provided to them 
we may be responsible for compensating our suppliers for these procurements in the event these items are not used in the quantities submitted as part of the production schedule or material becomes obsolete as a result of production timing  material changes or design changes 
at december  we maintained a deposit of million with our bank in the united kingdom as security for payment of customs and duties charges 
this amount is included in other long term assets 
in the us  we have complemented our direct sales efforts by entering into group purchasing agreements with major healthcare group purchasing organizations gpo 
typically  a gpo negotiates with medical suppliers  such as us  on behalf of the gpo s member healthcare facilities  providing such members with uniform pricing and terms and conditions 
in exchange  the gpo identifies us as a preferred supplier for its members 
member facilities participating in the gpo s purchasing program can consist of hospitals  medical group practices  nursing homes  surgery centers  managed care organizations  long term care facilities  clinics and integrated delivery networks 
these agreements require us to pay fees based on the amount of sales generated from these agreements 
we recorded fees related to these agreements as sales and marketing expenses in the amounts of million in  million in and million in critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  warranty obligations  service contracts  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  valuation of investments and inventories  warranty expense  income taxes  stock based compensation  and convertible debt 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on products and accessories when goods are shipped under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer  sales returns are estimable and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are provided or over the term of the contract 
revenue is recorded net of any discounts  trade in allowances  and estimated returns 
we estimate returns by reviewing our historical returns  considering customer reaction to new product introductions and current economic conditions 
we separately price and sell product upgrades to our customers 

table of contents sales to distributors are generally made pursuant to standard distributor agreements 
we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss have transferred to the distributor 
our only significant post shipment obligation to distributors is our product warranty covering materials and workmanship see warranty expense below 
the distributor can only reject products for an obvious defect or shipping error  generally within days of receipt  and in such cases  replacement products would be sent 
since the distributor s remedy is the replacement of the product and not a refund or credit  we do not defer revenue associated with these sales 
costs associated with the repair of returned  defective products are captured in our warranty accrual 
our standard distributor arrangements do not have any other return provisions 
our sales arrangements may contain multiple elements  which include hardware and software products 
revenue from the sale of software  software related elements  and hardware when the software elements are more than incidental to the product as a whole  is recognized in accordance with software revenue recognition rules 
we have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our products 
accordingly  for transactions that have undelivered elements for which we have vsoe of the elements  revenue equal to the total fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and is not recognized until the element is delivered to the customer 
when the undelivered element represents services under extended service contracts  revenue equal to the stated price is deferred and recognized evenly over the contract term as those services are provided 
investments 
our investment securities primarily consist of high grade us government or corporate debt and high grade asset backed securities 
we have the ability to hold our securities until maturity  however  we classify all securities as available for sale  as the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity to implement management strategies 
these securities are carried at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses generally reported as a component of other comprehensive income until realized 
realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale securities  if any  are determined on a specific identification basis 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method 
interest income is recognized when earned 
a decline in market value of any available for sale security below cost that is determined to be other than temporary results in a revaluation of its carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established 
we may incur unrealized losses due to changes in market value attributable to changes in interest rates 
generally we have the ability and intent to hold our investments until a recovery of cost  which may be maturity 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out method 
included in our inventories balance are demonstration products used by our sales representatives and marketing department 
adjustments to reduce carrying costs to their net realizable values are recorded for obsolete material  shrinkage  earlier generation products and used or refurbished products held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product 
we make judgments regarding the carrying value of our inventories based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions  consumer demand and reimbursement criteria in the medical community 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to further write down the carrying cost of our inventories 
warranty expense 
we accrue estimated warranty expense at the time of sale for costs expected to be incurred under our product warranties 
this provision for warranty expense is made based upon our historical product failure rates and service repair costs using management s judgment 
we have limited history with some of our products 
we provide  with certain exceptions  a five year warranty with the micromaxx system  m turbo system and s series ultrasound tools 
given the length of the warranty period  the warranty liability for these systems is more difficult to estimate than it has been for our other products that have a one year warranty 
however  given the similarity of the components used in the m turbo system and s series ultrasound tools compared with our micromaxx system and the historical product failure rate and service repair costs of the 
table of contents micromaxx and the other systems  we believe that we can reasonably estimate the amount of the warranty liability for these products 
we expect our warranty liability and expense to continue to increase significantly due to the five year warranty offered with these products 
should actual failure rates or repair or replacement costs for any of our products differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required and our results may be materially affected 
income taxes 
the process of accounting for income taxes involves calculating our current tax obligation or refund and assessing the nature and measurements of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  and our net operating loss nol and credit carryforwards  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in each period  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
to the extent we believe that we would not meet the test that recovery is more likely than not  we would establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we would adjust our tax provision or tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  including estimates associated with uncertain tax positions and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets based on the weight of all positive and negative factors  including cumulative trends in profitability 
the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions 
the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge  if any  from tax authorities 
when facts and circumstances change  we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate 
we have accumulated foreign nol carryforwards and research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards 
in  we utilized our remaining us nol and alternative minimum tax credit carried forward from and a portion of our research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards 
we assess our ability to utilize our nol and tax credit carryforwards in future periods and record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
in addition  we reduce the deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol and tax credit carryforwards utilized currently 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments and charges 
based upon a review of historical operating performance  and our expectation that we will generate profits in the us and our international operations in the foreseeable future  we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the us and international deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
stock based compensation 
we recognize compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
for stock options  we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock based compensation at the date of grant  which requires the input of subjective assumptions  including expected volatility and expected term 
we estimate volatility by considering our historical stock volatility 
we estimate expected term based on historical trends 
further  we estimate future forfeitures for both stock options and rsus granted  which are not expected to vest 
we estimate forfeitures using historical forfeiture trends and employee turnover rates as well as our judgment of future forfeitures 
our estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from our estimate 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our stock based compensation 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions will be based on  or determined from  external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with stock based payment 
table of contents arrangements 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment  based on relevant facts and circumstances 
in addition  future grants of equity awards will result in additional compensation expense in future periods 
convertible debt and hedge transaction 
we have recorded our senior convertible note as debt 
the conversion option met the criteria  in our judgment  to preclude recognition as a debt discount 
if the conversion option had been recognized as a debt discount  it would have been recognized as additional interest expense over the term of the notes 
accordingly  our interest expense is based upon the stated rate 
additionally  we recorded the call option and warrant transactions as equity instruments since our judgment is that they met the existing criteria 
if the call option and warrant transactions had not met the criteria  then the instruments would have been recorded as assets or liabilities and any changes in the fair values would be recognized in the consolidated income statement 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  business combinations sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r expands the definition of a business and establishes the use of the acquisition method for business combinations 
this method requires all assets and liabilities  including goodwill  of an acquired business to be measured at fair value on the acquisition date 
among other things  the standard requires entities to expense most transaction and restructuring costs  establishes fair value measurement for contingent consideration in earnings  and requires capitalization of in process research and development 
the standard also modifies the recording and presentation of deferred taxes 
sfas no 
r will be applied prospectively to business combinations with acquisition dates on or after january  our adoption of sfas no 
r is not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity when it becomes effective 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 

sfas changes the accounting for noncontrolling minority interests in consolidated financial statements  including the requirements to classify noncontrolling interests as a component of consolidated stockholders equity  to identify earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of consolidated earnings  and to measure gain or loss on the deconsolidated subsidiary based upon the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment 
additionally  sfas revises the accounting for both increases and decreases in a parent s controlling ownership interest 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption prohibited 
we believe that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect to its consolidated financial statements

 determination of the useful life of intangible assets  fsp  which provides guidance about estimating the useful lives of recognized intangible assets  and requires additional disclosures related to renewing or extending the terms of recognized intangible assets 
fsp applies to all recognized intangible assets  including those not acquired in a business 
table of contents combination 
in estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset  fsp requires companies to consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements together with the asset s intended use  regardless of whether the arrangements have explicit renewal or extension provisions 
in the absence of historical experience  companies must consider the assumptions market participants would use about renewal or extension assumptions that are consistent with both the highest and best use of the asset and adjusted for entity specific factors 
fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the requirements for estimating useful lives must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
the disclosure requirements must be applied to all intangible assets recognized as of the effective date 
early adoption is prohibited 
we are currently reviewing the provisions of fsp to determine the impact on our future consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued fsp no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement apb  which clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash including partial cash settlement upon conversion 
apb requires issuers to account separately for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized 
apb requires bifurcation of a component of the conversion option  classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statement of income 
apb requires retrospective application to the terms of instruments as they existed for all periods presented 
apb is effective as of the first quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  and will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
early adoption is not permitted 
as a result of adopting apb in  we expect to recognize additional non cash interest expense of million for and million for item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk relating to changes in interest rates  which could adversely affect the value of our investments in marketable securities 
as of december   our investments consisted of million of interest bearing debt securities with maturities or expected maturities of less than one year and million of interest bearing debt securities with expected maturities of more than one year 
generally we have the ability to hold these securities until maturity  however  we have classified them as available for sale in the event of unanticipated cash needs 
the interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and related earnings for from a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk except for sales transacted by our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  we transact all our sales in usds  therefore  the obligations of many of our international customers are in usds 
our exposure to risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies relates primarily to the strengthening of the usd against the local currency of our international subsidiaries  which may result in foreign exchange losses on transactions with them  and our international customers  which may impact our ability to collect amounts owed by them 
as of december  of our outstanding accounts receivable balance was from international customers  of which  or million  was denominated in a currency other than usds 
total sales for the year ended december  denominated in a currency other than usds were million  or of total consolidated revenues 
the british pound  the european union euro and the japanese yen represented the 
table of contents majority of financial transactions executed in a currency not denominated in usds 
we regularly review our receivable positions in foreign countries for any indication that collection may be at risk 
in addition  we utilize letters of credit where they are considered necessary in order to mitigate our collection risk 
we periodically enter into foreign currency forward and participating forward contracts to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
as of december   we had million in notional amount of foreign currency contracts that expire on january  they serve as hedges of a substantial portion of our intercompany balances denominated in a currency other than the usd 
these foreign currencies primarily include the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the british pound  the euro and the japanese yen 
a sensitivity analysis of a change in the fair value of these contracts indicates that if the usd weakened by against the applicable foreign currency  the fair value of these contracts would decrease by million 
conversely  if the usd strengthened by against the applicable foreign currency  the fair value of these contracts would increase by million 
gains and losses in the fair value of these contracts are intended to offset the losses and gains on the underlying intercompany balances 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the sensitivity analysis above 
the fair value of these contracts as of december  was not material to our results of operations or our financial position
