executive overview of management s discussion and analysis we analyze the performance of our business using the following general framework and describe the performance of the business in this context throughout the remainder of this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales we analyze sales activity based on the impact of pricing  volume and mix of our products 
the management of pricing conditions and the execution of a strategy to improve sales mix to more profitable products and customers are important to us in order to grow sales and profitability 
productivity we identify the impact of key productivity programs in the areas of materials procurement  labor and other productivity programs 
the successful execution of productivity programs is important to offset the impacts of price decreases  commodity inflation and other cost escalations 
commodities we use commodities such as aluminum  copper  zinc and steel in our manufacturing process 
the cost of these commodities can have a significant impact on our financial performance 
investments we analyze the costs for the development of new products  investments in sales and marketing programs and other infrastructure investments in support of productivity improvements 
investments in new products and sales are important to sustaining organic growth 
please see the following paragraphs results of operations for compared with and results of operations compared with for an analysis of our results of operations excluding the effects of foreign exchange translation 
our markets and our customers our sales are affected by changes in truck and bus production  especially in europe 
europe is our largest geographic market and sales to truck and bus oems represent our largest customer group 
the table below shows the relationship between our european sales to truck and bus oems  which  account for approximately of our global sales to truck and bus oems and western european truck and bus t b production  for the last five years 
sales data is shown at a constant euro to us dollar exchange rate for year to year comparability and to make comparisons to unit production meaningful 
year to year change average change sales to european t b oems at constant fx rate western european t b production in general  our sales track directionally with truck and bus builds 
however  individual year to year sales changes are also influenced by other factors such as timing of orders and deliveries to t b oem customers  application content  new product introduction  price and introduction of new customer platforms 
the level of truck build activity is influenced by general economic conditions  including interest rate levels and inflation 
on average for the last five years  our european sales have performed percentage points above the change in western european truck and bus builds 
in regions outside europe  there is less correlation between our sales and regional truck and bus builds 
this is because of our smaller presence which magnifies changes in content on individual truck platforms as well as less stringent safety regulations 
as other regions adopt additional safety regulations in the future  similar to or approaching europe s  we expect the resulting increase in content will bring higher correlation between our regional sales and changes in regional truck and bus production 
our aftermarket sales account for approximately of total sales and are affected by a variety of factors content on specific vehicles and breadth of our product range  number of commercial trucks in active operation  truck age  miles driven  demand for transported goods and overall economic activity 
on average  our aftermarket sales on a constant exchange to the us dollar rate have grown by annually for the last five years as shown in the table below 
year to year change average change aftermarket sales at constant fx rate in the fourth quarter of the global commercial vehicle markets experienced the beginning of a significant decline that is unprecedented in its breadth  depth and speed 
it is currently accelerating into the first part of the uncertainty of the development of the global economy makes it difficult to predict how demand for commercial vehicles will develop in distribution of wabco s sales by major end markets  product types and geography major end markets oe manufacturers truck bus products trailer products car products aftermarket geography europe americas asia and rest of world our largest customer is daimler  which accounts for approximately of our sales 
other key customers include arvin meritor  china national heavy truck corporation cnhtc  cummins  fiat iveco  hino  hyundai  international truck engine corporation ite  man nutzfahrzeuge ag man  meritor wabco a joint venture  nissan diesel  paccar daf trucks nv daf  kenworth  leyland and peterbuilt  otto sauer achsenfabrik saf  scania  volvo mack and renault and zf friedrichshafen ag zf 
for the fiscal year ended december   our top customers accounted for approximately of our sales 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis addresses year over year changes in the line items shown in the above paragraph executive overview 
approximately of our sales are outside the us and therefore  changes in exchange rates can have a significant impact on the reported results of our operations  which are presented in us dollars 
year over year changes in sales  expenses and net income for compared with and compared with  are presented both with and without the effects of foreign currency translation 
changes in sales  expenses and net income excluding foreign exchange effects are calculated using current year sales  expenses and net income translated at prior year exchange rates 
presenting changes in sales  expenses and net income excluding the effects of foreign currency translation is not in conformity with us gaap  but we analyze this data because it is useful to us in understanding the operating performance of our business 
we believe this data is also useful to shareholders for the same reason 
the changes in sales  expenses and net income excluding the effects of foreign exchange translation are not meant to be a substitute for measurements prepared in conformity with us gaap  nor to be considered in isolation 
management believes that presenting these non us gaap financial measures is useful to shareholders because it enhances their understanding of how management assesses the operating performance of the company s business

sales in europe  our largest market  increased approximately decreased excluding favorable foreign currency translation effects  which was impacted by the severe production cuts experienced at all truck bus manufacturers in the latter part of the year 
sales decreased in north america  which experienced declines in the production of trucks and buses for the second consecutive year  in addition to a significant decline in trailer production 
these declines were attributable to the global recession environment in the latter part of the year as well as the economic problems associated with the credit markets  which put constraints on the end customers ability to obtain financing for new purchases 
notwithstanding the above  sales in asia and south america increased and  respectively and excluding favorable foreign currency translation effects  respectively 
the sales growth in asia was driven by an increase in china sales of without foreign currency translation impact  which was primarily driven by a successful introduction of the company s compressor product line in the market as well as the increasing penetration of abs 
the growth in south america resulted from the strong market demand in brazil  as well as expanded content per vehicle

although we were operating in a market that deteriorated significantly in the latter part of the year  the results generated from the wabco operating system provided for an increased benefit in gross profit from productivity improvements of approximately million 
these improvements were offset by sales price decreases of approximately million  labor and other cost escalation of approximately million  higher spending on streamlining programs of approximately million  and other net costs of million 
operating expenses operating expenses  which include selling and administrative expenses  product engineering expenses and other operating expenses  increased by million million excluding foreign currency translation effects

throughout the second half of the year  wabco proactively monitored the developments in the industry 
as the market decline became more significant in the fourth quarter  wabco rapidly accelerated the cost savings objectives resulting in total savings of million versus previously expected spending levels in the second half of these aggressive and efficiently executed actions helped drive down costs to significantly mitigate the impact of the market decline 
due to the degree of market declines occurring in the fourth quarter of  wabco commenced a streamlining program on october   which began with a consultative process with works councils and employee representatives globally 
the initial intent was to reduce the company s global workforce by approximately  positions of which approximately were terminated as of january  as the company continued to assess the impacts of the declining market conditions  in january  the company committed to a further reduction of positions  bringing the total for this streamlining plan to  this level of reduction in workforce represents an approximately reduction in capacity  while still allowing us to continue our focus on core strategies  including technology  new products  globalization  and quality and productivity initiatives 
these actions create sufficient flexibility in production and help to cope with anticipated demand volatility in in total  wabco incurred million of streamlining expenses during of which million was charged to selling and administrative expenses and million was charged to cost of sales

sales in europe  our largest market  increased approximately excluding favorable foreign currency translation effects  which based on our estimate  exceeded the growth in european truck production 
sales decreased in north america  which was less than the decrease in north american truck production 
the decrease in the north american truck production was primarily influenced by increased sales volume in ahead of regulations mandating better emissions standards that became effective in in asia and south america sales increased and  respectively and excluding favorable foreign currency translation effects  respectively

the impact on the net cash of terminating these two arrangements amounted to million  composed of a million impact from accounts receivable  million from other current assets  and million from other accrued liabilities during in addition to the separation related items mentioned above  our change is due to a reduction of our working capital during due to a weakening economy in the second half of  wabco ended the year with a lower accounts receivable balance 
additionally  the company was able to successfully reduce inventory levels in the fourth quarter of within investing activities  we made capital expenditures of million for  including million on plant and equipment  million of investments in tooling  and million in computer software 
this compared with capital expenditures of million in  including million on plant and equipment  million of investments in tooling and million in computer software 
as a result of the downturn in the economy  the company implemented controlled spending measures which resulted in capital expenditure reductions in the fourth quarter versus prior year 
the net cash used by financing activities during amounted to million while the financing activities for resulted in net cash provided of million 
in july  we repaid million of the outstanding credit facility which had been put into place by trane in with jp morgan 
this repayment was primarily financed through additional cash obtained from trane 
in order to finance the share buy back program and to fund the operations of the china facilities  we drew million from our million five year credit facility which was entered into in may  and million from our million credit facility in china 
prior to july   we had additional changes in the balance due from and to trane or its affiliates 
as further detailed in note  related party transactions  in notes to the consolidated financial statements  this balance was mainly made up of the net receipts from changes in loans due to from trane and its affiliates of million and dividends paid to trane and its affiliates of million 
the net cash provided was mainly used to finance the termination of the securitization programs  the redemption of the million principal amount of its guaranteed senior bonds prior to their maturity date of january  and the redemption of the credit facility with jp morgan of million 
as of december   our total third party indebtedness was million consisting primarily of million of long term debt borrowed under our rabobank facility  million of long term debt borrowed under our million year credit facility and million of short term debt borrowed under our bank of tokyo mitsubishi facility that is due to be repaid in november all facilities are discussed in note debt 
also  subsidiaries in other countries had borrowings from banks totaling million 
these loans support local working capital requirements 
we paid quarterly dividends amounting to million for and million for  respectively 
these dividends were funded by drawdowns on our million credit facility 
see credit agreements below for a description of the credit agreement 
wabco makes contributions to funded pension plans that at a minimum  meet all statutory funding requirements 
contributions in  including payment of benefits incurred by unfunded plans  totaled million 
contributions in are expected to be in line with the contributions made during our board of directors has approved million of expenditures under a program to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market

currently  the company is not making any additional share repurchases under the buy back program

wabco and its indian joint venture partners  members of the tvs group tvs  separated the non brakes division from the brakes division of their indian joint venture scl  through a plan of demerger 
tvs will transfer to wabco its shares in wabco tvs india ltd

depending on the trading share prices of scl and wabco tvs at the time of transfer of shares  the company may have to remit or may receive some amount of cash to or from tvs and a gain or loss on the transaction may be recognized in the income statement 
we employ several means to manage our liquidity and we are not dependent upon any one source of funding 
our sources of financing include cash flows from operations  bank credit agreements and the use of operating leases 
liquidity with regard to european commission fine in addition to cash on hand  we have in place a number of short and longer term credit agreements designed  in part  to assist us covering a fine expected to be imposed by the european commission 
due to the uncertainties surrounding the timing and potential amount of the fine  and the possible limitations of the amounts we can draw under such credit agreements based on our covenants  as further described below  we cannot make any prediction as to whether or not the funds available under the credit agreements will be sufficient to finance the fine at such time as it becomes due 
the borrowings under our existing credit agreements are limited by covenants see credit agreements below for an overview of the covenants 
the covenant which is expected to be the most restrictive  based on the current economic downturn  requires that our total net indebtedness not exceed three times a trailing four quarters adjusted ebitda ebitda covenant  as defined in the agreement to the five year million credit facility 
as of december  our trailing four quarters adjusted ebitda is million  which consists of million for the fourth quarter  million for the third quarter  million for the second quarter and million for the first quarter 
given a net indebtedness of million at december   this resulted in an ebitda covenant ratio of to we would expect that this covenant will limit our ability to borrow under our existing credit agreements in thus  we do not intend to extend our one year facilities that will come due in see credit agreements below for more detail on one year facilities with rabobank  abn amro and bank of tokyo mitsubishi but rather  we will focus our efforts on obtaining additional sources of liquidity which would not be subject to this trailing four quarters adjusted ebitda covenant and complement our million five year facility 
in addition to working on replacing our accounts receivable financing facility that was terminated on january   we are also pursuing other opportunities of financing that would allow for off balance sheet accounting treatment and would therefore not be subject to the constraints of the trailing four quarters adjusted ebitda covenant 
these possible sources of future liquidity may come from the factoring of additional accounts receivable balances  inventory financing programs  or the sale leaseback of certain property  plant and equipment 
while there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain these alternative sources of liquidity  based on our current discussions with other parties we believe that some of these opportunities will contribute  if needed  to our future funding requirements 
we would also try to obtain waivers of our financial debt covenants 
if we receive a fine from the european commission at an amount exceeding our available liquidity at the time  we will try to negotiate a payment plan with the commission 
we are advised this possibility exists in cases of extreme hardship and substantiated financial difficulties 
it is our understanding that it is not in the commission s interest  nor is it their intention  to force companies out of business due to fine payments and we believe that the commission will be sensitive to the current economic environment 
however this outcome cannot be assured due to the degree of discretion inherent in the commission s fining and enforcement powers 
although our available liquidity is currently adequate for our potential funding needs  future developments and an increasing downturn in the industry could negatively impact our liquidity  so we are continuing to proactively address potential constraints that may occur later during credit agreements on may   wabco entered into an unsecured  five year million  multi currency revolving credit facility that will expire on july  this is our primary bank credit agreement and it became available to us on august  the proceeds of the borrowings under the credit facility have been used to fund repurchases of our shares  pay quarterly dividends to our shareholders and to meet short term cash requirements 
additionally  the facility may be used to pay a fine or provide a bank guarantee that may be required pursuant to a decision relating to the european commission investigation matter as further described under the heading item legal proceedings the european commission investigation above 
up to million under this facility may be used for issuing letters of credit of which million was unused as of december   and up to million for same day borrowings 
the balance outstanding on this facility on december   is million 
the company has the ability to borrow an additional million under this facility 
the company intends to refinance all or some portion of the existing five year million credit facility at the time of its expiration 
on march   we entered into unsecured  day credit agreements with two banks  rabobank and abn amro  totaling million million at december  exchange rates 
the balance outstanding with rabobank is million on december  as a result of the draw down on july   the day million credit facility with rabobank has an expiration date of july  the balance outstanding is classified as long term as the company has the ability and intent to refinance the debt using the five year million  multi currency revolving credit facility 
there is no balance outstanding with abn amro on december  we currently do not intend to renew these facilities when they expire 
on november  we entered into a million million at december  exchange rates  day credit agreement with the bank of tokyo mitsubishi 
as of december   the outstanding balance under this facility was million 
prior to its expiration  this facility was extended for a further day period 
as a result of the draw down on november   the day million credit facility with bank of tokyo has an expiration date of november  we currently do not intend to renew this facility when it expires in november  and may repay the principal and interest earlier 
the above credit facilities contain various covenants that limit  among other things  liens  transactions  subsidiary indebtedness  and certain mergers and sales of assets 
the covenants also require us to meet certain financial tests a to ratio of consolidated net indebtedness to consolidated trailing four quarters adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  a to ratio of consolidated trailing four quarters adjusted ebitda to consolidated net interest expense  and a liquidity test 
these terms are all defined within the agreement to the five year million credit facility 
the liquidity covenant for the million credit facility requires us to have at least million of liquidity which includes unused commitments under the agreement and certain other committed facilities that may be entered into  as well as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents after giving effect to any payment of a fine or any provision of a bank guarantee that may be required pursuant to a decision relating to the european commission investigation matter 
for additional information relating to the terms of the credit agreement we refer to the form k filed by trane on june  as of december   the company was in compliance with all the covenants contained in these credit agreements 
on january   our accounts receivable financing facility  which was entered into in the second quarter of  was terminated by abn royal bank of scotland rbs due to the downgrade of rbs by s p 
that agreement had provided for the financing of up to million of receivables  which qualified for off balance sheet accounting treatment  and was not subject to the trailing four quarters adjusted ebitda covenant described above 
the company is currently in the process of seeking a replacement of this facility with another facility that should be similar in nature  although it may differ in size 
cross currency swap the unsecured day million credit facility entered into in march with rabobank discussed above under credit agreements  included a requirement to draw down on the facility within a certain time period to avoid termination of the facility 
therefore  the full million  or million us dollars  was drawn down on july  and used to pay down the five year million  multi currency revolving credit facility expiring on july as a result of the draw down on july   the day million credit facility with rabobank has an expiration date of july  in order to avoid foreign currency risk associated with the euro denominated borrowing  the company entered into a cross currency swap with rabobank on july   and designated the swap as a fair value hedge of the changes in the fair value of the underlying debt resulting from exchange rate movements between the euro and us dollar 
the fair value hedge is highly effective and therefore any volatility resulting from translating the hedged debt into us dollars and the remeasurement of the swap have not had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
for additional information relating to the terms of the cross currency swap  refer to note debt 
streamlining program initiated on october   the company commenced a consultative process with works councils and employee representatives regarding intended reductions in the company s global workforce by approximately  positions  of which approximately were terminated as of january  based on the continued deterioration in the industry  in january  the company has committed to a further reduction of an additional employees 
in many cases  reductions in workforce can only be effected subject to completion of a formal consultation process with works councils in accordance with applicable local laws 
the company estimates that the streamlining charges and related cash payments associated with this activity will range from million to million of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of  and would result in anticipated annualized savings of approximately million to million 
the company expects that this activity will be fully completed in the first half of it is anticipated that the principal categories of associated costs would consist of termination and severance costs  costs associated with the provision of job outplacement services  and other employee benefit related costs 
off balance sheet arrangements we had an unutilized accounts receivable financing facility effective as of december  this program was subsequently terminated on january  contractual obligations following is a summary of contractual obligations as of december  aggregate contractual obligations as of december  in millions payments due by period contractual obligation total and and beyond debt obligations principal plus interest operating lease obligations tax indemnifications purchase obligations unfunded pension and post retirement benefits fin tax liabilities total the amounts and timing of such obligations  as shown in the table may vary substantially from amounts that will actually be paid in future years 
for example  the actual amount to be paid under debt obligations under our primary credit agreement will depend on the amount of debt outstanding under the agreement in each year 
amounts shown for debt obligations include the associated interest amounting to million  calculated at the december  rates applicable to each type of debt 
amounts include future rental commitments under all non cancelable operating leases in effect at december  the present value of the million total is equivalent to approximately million  discounted at an assumed rate of 
amounts are estimated costs as a result of transactions needed to affect the separation of wabco from trane 
see note certain tax and indemnification liabilities transferred from trane 
the remaining million is classified as long term and the company is currently unable to estimate the timing of the potential amounts to be paid beyond in the normal course of business we expect to purchase approximately billion in of materials and services  and estimate that on average no more than approximately million is outstanding at any one time in the form of legally binding commitments 
we spent approximately billion  billion and billion on materials and services in  and  respectively 
amounts represent undiscounted projected benefit payments to wabco s unfunded plans over the next ten years  as well as expected contributions to funded pension plans for the expected benefit payments are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure our accumulated benefit obligation at the end of and include benefits attributable to estimated future employee service of current employees 
amounts represent the company s unrecognized tax benefits including interest of million potentially owed to tax authorities as described below in note income taxes 
the entire liability is classified as long term and the company is currently unable to estimate the potential amounts to be paid beyond capital expenditures we believe our capital spending in recent years has been sufficient to maintain efficient production capacity  to implement important product and process redesigns and to expand capacity to meet increased demand 
productivity projects have freed up capacity in our manufacturing facilities and are expected to continue to do so 
we expect to continue investing to expand and modernize our existing facilities and invest in our facilities to create capacity for new product development 
due to the rapid decline that the commercial vehicle industry is experiencing going into  we expect to make capital expenditures on plant and equipment  tooling and computer software in at lower levels in comparison to effect of recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  provides a framework for measuring fair value under current standards in gaap  and requires additional disclosure about fair value measurements 
in accordance with the statement  the definition of fair value retains the exchange price notion  and exchange price is defined as the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or transfer a liability 
if there is a principal market for the asset or liability  the fair value measurement should reflect that price  whether that price is directly observable or otherwise used in a valuation technique 
depending on the asset or liability being valued  the inputs used to determine fair value can range from observable inputs ie prices based on market data independent from the entity and unobservable inputs ie entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use 
the statement applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and will be effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company adopted sfas no 
as of january  and the impact of adoption was immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits entities to voluntarily choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
the election is made on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company adopted sfas no 
as of january  and there was no impact of adoption to the company s consolidated financial statements as the company elected not to measure any additional assets or liabilities at fair value 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas no 
r requires that identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree be recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value regardless of the percentage of ownership 
the standard also requires any shares issued for acquisition to be measured at fair value on the date of acquisition as well as any contingent consideration recognized or pre acquisition gain or loss contingencies 
in process research and development will not be capitalized and any acquisition related transaction costs should be expensed as incurred 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is prohibited 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
r the company elected to write off capitalized transaction related costs in the fourth quarter of of approximately million when it became probable that the acquisition would not close before the effective date of sfas r 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
requires that a noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary be displayed in the consolidated statement of financial position as a separate component of equity 
consistent with the fasb s view that noncontrolling interests are part of the equity of the consolidated group  sfas no 
requires that earnings attributed to the noncontrolling interests are to be reported as part of consolidated earnings and not as a separate component of income or expense 
once a subsidiary is consolidated  any change in ownership that does not result in loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction 
however  deconsolidation of a subsidiary would result in a gain or loss reflected in the company s income statement 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is prohibited 
the company believes that the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements  although changes in the financial statement presentation will be required 
as of december  and the company would reclassify million and million  respectively  from minority interest  which is currently shown in liabilities  to a new line item  within shareholders equity

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and iii the effect of derivative instruments and related hedged items on a company s financial position 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company will adopt this statement as of january  as sfas no 
relates specifically to disclosures  this standard will have no impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
those judgments and estimates have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements because they result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we frequently re evaluate our judgments and estimates that are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the ones that may involve a higher degree of uncertainty  judgment and complexity are stock based compensation  post retirement benefits  warranties  streamlining expenses  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts and commitments and contingencies 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts wabco analyzes the aging of accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
stock based compensation trane  wabco s former parent company  adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised fas r  share based payments on january  fas r requires the company to measure and recognize in its combined statement of income the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including stock options  restricted stock units  restricted stock grants and discounts on employee stock purchases associated with the employee stock purchase plan espp based on estimated fair values 
the company utilizes the black scholes option valuation model to measure the amount of compensation expense to be recognized for each option award 
there are several assumptions that must be made when using the black scholes model such as the expected term of each option  the expected volatility of the stock price during the expected term of the option  the expected dividends to be paid and the risk free interest rate expected during the option term 
the company has reviewed each of these assumptions carefully and based on the analysis discussed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements determined its best estimate for these variables 
of these assumptions  the expected term of the option and expected volatility of wabco s common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of employees and expected performance of wabco s stock 
an increase in the volatility of wabco s stock will increase the amount of compensation expense on new awards 
an increase in the holding period of options will also cause an increase in compensation expense 
dividend yields and risk free interest rates are less difficult to estimate  but an increase in the dividend yield will cause a decrease in expense and an increase in the risk free interest rate will increase compensation expense 
post retirement benefits the company has significant pension and post retirement benefit costs and liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  merit and promotion increases and the health care cost trend rate 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and health care costs  in making its assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 
the assumptions as to the expected long term rates of return on plan assets are based upon the composition of plan assets  historical long term rates of return on similar assets and current and expected market conditions 
the discount rate used for us plans reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income investments on the company s annual measurement date december and is subject to change each year 
the discount rate was determined by matching  on an approximate basis  the coupons and maturities for a portfolio of corporate bonds rated aa or better by moody s investor services to the expected plan benefit payments defined by the projected benefit obligation 
the discount rates used for plans outside the us are based on a combination of relevant indices regarding corporate and government securities  the duration of the liability and appropriate judgment 
a decrease of one percentage point in the assumed rate of return on plan assets and a decrease of one percentage point in the discount rate applied to projected benefit obligations would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
an increase of one percentage point in the assumed health care cost trend rate in each future year would increase annual health insurance costs by approximately million 
see the disclosures about pension and post retirement obligations  the composition of plan assets  assumptions and other matters in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
warranties estimated product warranty expenses are accrued in cost of good sold at the time the related sales are recognized 
estimates of warranty expenses are based primarily on warranty claims experience and specific customer contracts 
warranty expenses include accruals for basic warranties for product sold  as well as accruals for product recalls  service campaigns and other related events when they are known and estimable 
to the extent we experience changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual is adjusted accordingly 
warranty accrual estimates are updated based upon the most current warranty claims information available 
such changes in estimates  including foreign currency exchange effects increased our warranty accrual by a net of million in  million in and million in the warranty accrual includes foreign currency exchange effects of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a three year summary of warranty costs 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company has entered into a cross currency swap to minimize the risks and costs associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar 
the swap agreement is a contract to exchange variable rate for variable rate interest payments over the life of the agreement and to exchange notional amounts of euro and us dollar at the termination of the agreement 
the company recognizes the derivative financial instrument in the consolidated financial statements at fair value 
the company s current derivative instrument is designated as a fair value hedge of the changes in the fair value of the underlying debt resulting from exchange rate movements between the euro and the us dollar 
changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument qualifying for hedge accounting is recorded as an offset to the changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item and is included in the account other non operating expense  net 
see note debt for additional details 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to decrease the net deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to increase the net deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
deferred tax assets have been reduced by a valuation allowance of million 
we also estimate our effective income tax rate periodically  considering all known factors and the estimated effects of future events or tax planning strategies that can cause that rate to vary from the statutory rate 
estimating the outcome of future events is inherently uncertain and final resolution of those events can cause the effective rate to vary significantly 
on january   wabco adopted the provision of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin provides recognition criteria and a related measurement model for tax positions taken by companies 
in accordance with fin  a tax position is a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax filing that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
tax positions shall be recognized only when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than  based on technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination and ultimate settlement 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold should be measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
whether the more likely than not recognition threshold is met for a tax position  is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence 
the company accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
commitments and contingencies commitments wabco and its indian joint venture partners  members of the tvs group tvs  separated the non brakes division from the brakes division of their indian joint venture scl 
this was done through a plan of demerger  which was approved by the madras high court and became effective on march  under indian law 
as a result  the brakes business of scl was transferred to a new company  wabco tvs india ltd 
wabco tvs  the shares of which were allocated proportionately in may to existing scl shareholders and were listed in india as of october  subsequent to the demerger  tvs will transfer to wabco its shares in wabco tvs  and wabco s percentage ownership in wabco tvs will increase to a minimum of approximately by september   and expected to increase to by no later than september  upon wabco obtaining control of wabco tvs  wabco tvs will be included in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
concurrent with tvs share transfers to the company  wabco will transfer to tvs its shares in scl post demerger  and wabco s percentage ownership in scl post demerger  which consists of the non brakes division of scl  is expected to decrease to zero 
the company believes that the demerger should be tax free based on an opinion from outside counsel 
the company has also requested a private letter ruling from the us internal revenue service 
the subsequent transfer of its shares in scl post demerger to tvs is likely to be taxable in the us at the time of such transfer 
the company continues to work with its tax advisors to validate the intended us tax treatment of the planned transactions 
additionally  depending on the trading share prices of scl and wabco tvs at the time of transfer of shares  the company may have to remit or may receive some amount of cash to or from tvs and a gain or loss on the transaction may be recognized in the income statement 
contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to products and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of liability to be recorded  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the liabilities recorded may change in the future  possibly by significant amounts  due to new developments in any of the matters 
as part of a multi company investigation commenced in  the former american standard and certain of its european subsidiaries engaged in the bath and kitchen business were charged by the european commission for alleged infringements of european union competition rules relating to the distribution of bathroom fixtures and fittings in a number of european countries 
pursuant to the indemnification and cooperation agreement that was concluded in the context of the separation  wabco europe bvba an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of wabco is responsible for  and is liable to indemnify trane and ideal standard international representing the successor to the bath and kitchen business  and owner of certain of the former american standard subsidiaries and their owners against  any fines related to this investigation 
we anticipate that this investigation may result in the imposition of a fine in  however  we are unable to reasonably estimate the likely amount or range of any fine that may result from this matter for the reasons that follow 
under its fining guidelines  the commission will determine a basic amount of the fine by considering the value of the sales of goods to which the infringement related  the gravity of the infringement and its duration 
in applying the guidelines  the commission retains considerable discretion in calculating the fine  including the determination of the basic amount  the evaluation of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances  the availability of leniency and the assessment of the overall deterrent effect of the fine 
due to the specific circumstances  and the factual differences of published precedents so far  there is insufficient guidance to allow us to ascertain how the commission would exercise its discretion in applying the guidelines in the present case 
if the commission were to apply the guidelines to the allegations as set forth in the statement of objections  the fine could be significant depending on whether the breadth of the allegations and the alleged duration of the infringement are maintained 
american standard and its charged european businesses presented defenses to the allegations in the statement of objections  as did wabco europe bvba at an oral hearing with the european commission in november it is not possible to judge the impact of these defenses on the final outcome 
following the hearing  the european commission has twice requested additional information  once in june requesting information regarding revenue of the relevant entities for the year  and again in december requesting information of wabco  ideal standard international  and trane regarding the spin off of wabco from american standard and certain historic corporate information including data regarding the corporate structures of american standard and its successors before and after the spin off and the transition of entities and or assets to trane and ideal standard international 
the commission could  among other things  issue a new statement of objections or request additional information before adopting a decision  or it could adopt a decision imposing a fine 
we believe that the commission will likely request further information regarding revenue before imposing a fine 
a fine would under the applicable rules be required to be paid within three months of the decision  unless imposition of any such fine were appealed within two months of the decision in which case we would be required to pay the fine or to provide a bank guarantee for the full amount of the fine plus interest 
the appeals process could take as long as years during which time wabco would not have access to such funds or would be required to provide a bank guarantee 
the commission or the european court of first instance could agree to waive or suspend this requirement for reasons of financial hardship  however this outcome cannot be assured and will depend on the relevant facts at the time 
article of council regulation no 
provides for a maximum fine equal to of the parent company s worldwide revenue attributable to all of its products for the fiscal year prior to the year in which the fine is imposed 
it is unknown on what basis the commission will calculate the maximum 
as we have previously reported  if the commission had issued a fine in and based it on american standard s reported worldwide revenue in  the total potential maximum liability would have been approximately billion subject to a probable reduction for leniency of at least 
american standard no longer exists 
the effect  if any  of the spin off of wabco from american standard  the sale of its bath and kitchen business to ideal standard international  and the merger of trane with ingersoll rand  all of which occurred in and  on the determination of the applicable cap is unclear 
furthermore  we have argued that the cap should be calculated on the basis of the revenue of the charged european businesses  rather than the parent company s worldwide revenues 
the fine imposed by the commission could be material to wabco s operating results and cash flows for the year in which the liability would be recognized or the fine paid 
we are however continuing to fully cooperate with the commission and believe the defenses we have presented to the commission will be considered and taken into account in the determination of the fine 
as of december   the company had a cash balance of million 
the company has several credit facilities in place all of which contain covenant restrictions 
the million five year revolving credit facility is a non amortizing facility that permits utilization up to the maximum level at any time through and until expiration  subject to the stipulated financial liquidity covenants in the credit agreement 
the company has entered into a million million at december  exchange rates  day credit agreement dated november  additionally  on march   the company entered into two separate unsecured  day million credit facilities million each at december exchange rates 
there is a balance of million outstanding on the million credit facility 
there is a balance of million outstanding on the million day credit agreement 
there is a balance of million outstanding on one of the day million credit facilities 
there is no balance outstanding on the remaining day million facility as of december  the borrowings under our existing credit agreements are limited by covenants see credit agreements above for an overview of the covenants 
the covenant which is expected to be the most restrictive  based on the current economic downturn  requires that our total net indebtedness not exceed three times a trailing four quarters adjusted ebitda  as defined in the agreement to the five year million credit facility 
as of december  our trailing four quarters adjusted ebitda is million  which consists of million for the fourth quarter  million for the third quarter  million for the second quarter and million for the first quarter 
given a net indebtedness of million at december   this resulted in an ebitda covenant ratio of to we would expect that this covenant will limit our ability to borrow under our existing credit agreements in the company is proactively addressing this matter by pursuing alternative financing arrangements that would not be subject to the ebitda covenant 
as described above  the company s accounts receivable financing facility was terminated on january  as a result of an event outside of the company s control 
the company is in negotiations to obtain a substitute facility to replace the loss of this accounts receivable financing facility  which is expected to be similar in nature but may differ in size 
additionally  other potential sources of financing that the company is considering include but are not limited to the following i factoring of additional accounts receivable balances  ii inventory financing programs  iii sale leaseback of certain property  plant and equipment  and iv obtain a waiver or renegotiate the debt covenants on our existing million five year credit facility 
if a fine in excess of our funding capability were issued  the company would seek approval from the commission for alternative payment measures  such as payment in installments  which is available in certain circumstances 
as a further option  the company may be able to apply for a court ordered suspension of its payment obligation to the court of first instance  a statutory available remedy in cases of hardship 
the uncertainty of the extent and duration of the current global industry downturn requires us to observe that if the fine were to be issued in an amount in excess of our funding capability at that time  and various mitigating actions which the company has implemented and is planning were to fail  the fine could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and liquidity of wabco

risk factors 
in conjunction with the tax sharing agreement  as further discussed in note  tax and indemnification liabilities transferred from trane to wabco  in notes to the consolidated financial statements  wabco is responsible for certain tax and indemnification liabilities 
these liabilities include indemnifications to trane of million related to the non us entities of trane s bath kitchen business 
the unrecognized tax benefits of million discussed further within note  income taxes  includes million of unrecognized tax benefits related to trane s bath kitchen business for which wabco has obligations directly to tax authorities 
cyclical and seasonal nature of business the industry in which we operate is cyclical 
over of our sales are for newly manufactured trucks  buses and trailers  the production of which follows long investment cycles and are impacted by macro economic factors and legislation 
global commercial vehicle production has consistently been growing since in the fourth quarter of  however  the global commercial vehicle markets experienced the beginning of a significant decline that is unprecedented in its breadth  depth and speed 
it is currently accelerating into the first part of the uncertainty of the development of the global economy makes it difficult to predict how demand for commercial vehicles will develop in the continued adoption of new technologies by truck and bus manufacturers helps to mitigate some of the impact of declines in truck and bus production 
the commercial vehicle industry is not subject to seasonal impacts

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct operations through subsidiaries in most of the major countries of western europe  brazil  poland  china  south korea and japan as well as the us 
in addition  we conduct business in some countries through affiliated companies and partnerships in which we own or less of the stock or partnership interest 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates have a significant impact on the reported results of our operations  which are presented in us dollars 
the largest of these exposures to currency exchange rates is between the euro and us dollar 
we believe our primary exposures to changes in currency exchange rates are associated with the following translation we face foreign currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated throughout the year 
a hypothetical weakening of all other currencies in relation to the us dollar would have resulted in an approximate million reduction in the reported net income 
sourcing and manufacturing strategy a significant and growing portion of our products are sourced and manufactured in currencies different than the currency in which they are sold resulting in increased exposure to foreign exchange risks 
based on our transaction flow  a weakening of all other currencies in relation to the us dollar would have resulted in an approximate million increase in the reported net income 
transaction gains and losses certain of our monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity 
based on december  balances  a weakening of all other currencies in relation to the us dollar would have resulted in an approximate million decrease in the reported net income 
the aggregate impact of a hypothetical weakening of all other currencies in relation to the us dollar relating to the abovementioned exposures would have resulted in an approximate million decrease in the reported net income
