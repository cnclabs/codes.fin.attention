item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in this document 
please refer to the glossary of terms immediately following the table of contents for a listing and detailed description of the various technical  industry and other defined terms that are used in this form k 
samsung settlement on january   we entered into a patent license agreement the samsung pla with samsung electronics co  ltd 
samsung covering samsung s affiliates  including samsung electronics america  inc the agreement supersedes the terms of the binding term sheet signed in november by such parties and provides for the termination of the patent license agreement between us 
under the terms of the agreement  samsung has agreed to pay us million in four equal installments over an month period to resolve the outstanding arbitration disputes involving samsung s sale of g products  as well as the patent disputes over samsung s sales of g products 
following our january  receipt of samsung s first payment  the parties moved to end all litigation and arbitration proceedings ongoing between them as more fully discussed in item of part i of this form k 
under the terms of the samsung pla  we have granted samsung a royalty bearing license covering samsung s sale of g products including products built under both the wcdma and cdma standards and certain of their related extensions through and a license covering samsung s sale of g single mode tdma based products that will become paid up in we will recognize the revenue associated with the agreement ratably from january  through the expiration of the agreement on december  the total amount of revenue recognized will include approximately million of deferred revenue from our patent license agreement 
beginning in first quarter  and in accordance with our accounting policies  we will recognize within our accounts receivable all payments due from samsung within twelve months of our balance sheet date 
our operating expenses include a fourth quarter charge of million to increase our accrual for a performance based cash incentive under our long term compensation program ltcp from the previously estimated payout of to the actual payout of 
the increase in the incentive payout was driven by the company s success in a number of key goals including signing lg electronics  inc lg and samsung  two of the top five cellular handset oems  to g licensing agreements 
these licenses helped increase our share of the g market under license from approximately to approximately  and drove substantial positive operating cash flow over the period 
slimchip in october  we announced that  due to the rapidly changing landscape of suppliers and customers of digital baseband technology  we were evaluating a number of options for the modem portion of our business 
these options could include an acquisition or partnership to achieve the appropriate scale needed to succeed in the market  or the disposition of the modem product portion of our business through a sale or closure 
we continue to evaluate these options  and while we have had substantive discussions with potential counterparties  we have not made a final determination of the most appropriate option to pursue 
a final decision could occur as early as the first quarter the ultimate outcome of this evaluation and pursuit of an option could result in an impairment of long lived assets related to the modem business 
the assets that could be affected include all or a significant portion of our intangible assets  which totaled million and million  net of accumulated amortization  at december  and  respectively  and a significant portion of our property and equipment  which totaled million and million  net of accumulated depreciation  at december  and while a disposition of the modem portion of our business could create significant long term cost savings and improved cash flow  it could also produce a near term repositioning charge and a significant reduction to our technology solutions revenue  which contributed million  million and million of revenue at december   and  respectively 
as a result of our october announcement  we evaluated the carrying value of our long lived assets associated with the modem business in accordance with sfas no 
we concluded that there was no impairment at december  business we design and develop advanced digital wireless technologies for use in digital cellular and wireless ieee related products 
we actively participate in and contribute our technology solutions to worldwide organizations responsible for the development and approval of standards to which digital cellular and ieee compliant products are built  and our contributions are regularly incorporated into such standards 
we offer licenses to our patents to equipment producers that manufacture  use and sell digital cellular and ieee related products 
in addition  we offer for license or sale our slimchip family of mobile broadband modem solutions which includes modem ip know how  baseband ics  embedded modules and reference platforms to mobile device manufacturers  semiconductor companies and other equipment producers that manufacture  use and sell digital cellular products 
we have built our suite of technology and patent offerings through independent development  joint development with other companies and selected acquisitions 
our goal is to derive revenue on every g mobile device sold  either in the form of patent licensing revenues  product related revenues  or a combination of these elements 
in recent years  our patent license agreements have contributed the majority of our cash flow and revenues 
including agreements signed in first quarter  we now derive revenue from approximately one half of all g mobile devices sold worldwide  up from approximately one third at the beginning of in  and our total revenues were million  million and million  respectively  and our recurring revenues were million  million and million  respectively 
recurring patent licensing revenue made up at least of our total recurring revenues in each period 
in  the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments accounted for approximately of our recurring patent licensing revenues 
due to the nature of the revenue recognition  these fixed fee revenues are not affected by the related licensees success in the market or the general economic climate 
the remaining portion of our recurring patent licensing revenue is variable in nature due to the per unit nature of the related license agreements 
approximately three fourths of this per unit variable portion for related to sales of product by japanese licensees for whom the majority of the sales are within japan 
as a result  our per unit variable patent license royalties have been  and will continue to be  largely influenced by sales within the japanese cellular market 
we expect that the proportion of our recurring patent licensing revenues resulting from fixed fee payments will increase in early upon our recognition of revenue associated with our new agreement with samsung 
under that agreement  effective january  samsung will make payments totaling million over the next months 
industry overview our future revenues and cash flows are dependent  in large part  on industry wide sales of wireless products 
over the course of the last ten years  the cellular communications industry has experienced rapid growth worldwide 
total worldwide cellular wireless communications subscriptions rose from slightly more than million at the end of to approximately billion at the end of in several countries  mobile telephones now outnumber fixed line telephones 
market analysts expect that the aggregate number of global wireless subscriptions could exceed billion in in june  strategy analytics  inc forecasted billion total handset sales for recently  strategy analytics  inc lowered their forecast for handset sales by 
the following table includes the recent forecast for and the june forecast for through  the latest forecast available for that period 
graph source strategy analytics  inc december global handset shipment forecast by quarter for through strategy analytics  inc june global handset sales historical and forecast through includes wcdma hspa  lte  and td scdma 
includes cdma and its evolutions  such as ev do 
includes gsm gprs edge and analog  iden  tdma  phs and pdc 
the growth in new cellular subscribers  combined with existing customers choosing to replace their mobile phones  helped fuel the growth of mobile phone sales from approximately million units in to almost billion units in we believe the combination of a broad subscriber base  continued technological change and the growing dependence on the internet  e mail and other digital media sets the stage for continued growth in the sales of advanced wireless products and services over the next five years 
while recent market forces and a global economic downturn may contribute to a decline in total handset sales for  analysts continue to predict that the shift to advanced g devices will continue to increase sales in that category 
for these same reasons  shipments of g enabled phones  which represented approximately of the market in  are predicted to increase to approximately of the market by moreover  recent advances in g technologies that support devices offering higher data rates have met with rapid consumer uptake 
in addition to the advances in digital cellular technologies  the industry has also made significant advances in non cellular wireless technologies 
in particular  ieee wlan has gained momentum in recent years as a wireless broadband solution in the home and office and in public areas 
ieee technology offers high speed data connectivity through unlicensed spectra within a relatively modest operating range 
since its introduction in  semiconductor shipments of products built to the ieee standard have shipped nearly billion units cumulatively through analysts forecast that these cumulative shipments may reach billion by in addition  the ieee wireless standards bodies are creating sets of standards to enable higher data rates  provide coverage over longer distances and enable roaming 
these standards are establishing technical specifications for high data rates  such as ieee wimax  as well as technology specifications to enable seamless handoff between different air interfaces ieee 
repurchase of common stock in  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock the repurchase program 
in october  our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program the repurchase program 
the company could repurchase shares under the programs through open market purchases  pre arranged trading plans or privately negotiated purchases 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock for million 
at december   we accrued accounts payable of approximately million associated with our obligation to settle late december repurchases 
we completed the repurchase program in first half through the repurchase of an additional million shares of common stock for million in under the october authorization in  we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock for million 
at december   we accrued accounts payable of approximately million associated with our obligation to settle late december repurchases 
during  we completed the repurchase program through the repurchase of million shares of common stock for million 
intellectual property rights enforcement from time to time  if we believe any party is required to license our patents in order to manufacture and sell certain digital cellular products and such party has not done so  we may institute legal action against them 
this legal action typically takes the form of a patent infringement lawsuit or an administrative proceeding such as a section proceeding before the us international trade commission usitc 
in addition  we and our licensees  in the normal course of business  might seek to resolve disagreements between the parties with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties under the applicable license agreement through arbitration or litigation 
in  our patent litigation and arbitration costs decreased to million from million in this represented of our total patent administration and licensing costs of million 
patent litigation and administration costs will vary depending upon activity levels and it is likely they will continue to be a significant expense for us in the future 
development our investments in the development of advanced digital wireless technologies and related products include maintaining a highly specialized engineering team and providing that team with the equipment and advanced software platforms necessary to support the development of technologies 
over each of the last three years  our cost of development has ranged between and of our total operating expense  exclusive of non recurring contingency accruals and repositioning charges 
the largest portion of our cost of development has been personnel costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles  generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in both our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from these estimates and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements and are included in item of this form k 
we believe the accounting policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and that may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment in their application compared to others are those relating to patents  contingencies  revenue recognition  compensation and income taxes 
if different assumptions were made or different conditions had existed  our financial results could have been materially different 
patents we capitalize external costs  such as filing fees and associated attorney fees  incurred to obtain issued patents and patent license rights 
we expense costs associated with maintaining and defending patents subsequent to their issuance 
we amortize capitalized patent costs on a straight line basis over ten years  which represents the estimated useful lives of the patents 
the ten year estimated useful life of internally generated patents is based on our assessment of such factors as the integrated nature of the portfolios being licensed  the overall makeup of the portfolio over time and the length of license agreements for such patents 
the estimated useful lives of acquired patents and patent rights  however  have and will continue to be based on separate analyses related to each acquisition and may differ from the estimated useful lives of internally generated patents 
the average estimated useful life of acquired patents used thus far has been years 
we assess the potential impairment to all capitalized net patent costs when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our patent portfolio may not be recoverable 
amortization expense related to capitalized patent costs was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had capitalized gross patent costs of million and million  respectively  which were offset by accumulated amortization of million and million  respectively 
the weighted average estimated useful life of our capitalized patent costs at december  and was years and years  respectively 
contingencies we recognize contingent assets and liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
we do not include expected legal fees to defend ourselves in our accruals for contingent liabilities  we expense such legal fees in the periods in which the related services are provided 
in second quarter  we recorded a million charge to increase a million contingent liability to million 
subsequently we have accrued post judgment interest expense of million million during and reported such interest expense within the interest and investment income  net  line within our consolidated statements of income 
this contingency relates to an arbitration with federal over an insurance reimbursement agreement 
in second quarter  interdigital deposited million with the clerk of the court  an amount sufficient to secure federal s judgment and anticipated interest until decision by the court of appeals 
in fourth quarter  we accrued million for the potential reimbursement of legal fees associated with our ukii matter with nokia 
during  we recognized a credit of million associated with the reduction of this accrual in connection with the resolution of the nokia uk matters 
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenue from patent licensing 
the timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations 
such agreements are often complex and include multiple elements 
these agreements can include  without limitation  elements related to the settlement of past patent infringement liabilities  up front and non refundable license fees for the use of patents and or know how  patent and or know how licensing royalties on covered products sold by licensees  cross licensing terms between us and other parties  the compensation structure and ownership of intellectual property rights associated with contractual technology development arrangements  advanced payments and fees for service arrangements  and settlement of outstanding patent litigation 
due to the inherent difficulty in establishing reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable evidence of the fair value of the separate elements of these agreements  the total revenue resulting from such agreements may sometimes be recognized over the performance period 
in other circumstances  such as those agreements involving consideration for past and expected future patent royalty obligations  after consideration of the particular facts and circumstances  the appropriate recording of revenue between periods may require the use of judgment 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized after all of the following criteria are met written agreements have been executed  delivery of technology or intellectual property rights has occurred or services have been rendered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectability of fees is reasonably assured 
we establish a receivable for payments expected to be received within twelve months from the balance sheet date based on the terms in the license 
our reporting of such payments often results in an increase to both accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
deferred revenue associated with fixed fee royalty payments is classified on the balance sheet as short term when it is scheduled to be amortized within twelve months from the balance sheet date 
all other deferred revenue is classified as long term  as amounts to be recognized over the next twelve months are not known 
patent license agreements upon signing a patent license agreement  we provide the licensee permission to use our patented inventions in specific applications 
we account for patent license agreements in accordance with emerging issue task force eitf no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition 
we have elected to utilize the leased based model for revenue recognition  with revenue being recognized over the expected period of benefit to the licensee 
under our patent license agreements  we typically receive one or a combination of the following forms of payment as consideration for permitting our licensees to use our patented inventions in their applications and products consideration for prior sales consideration related to a licensee s product sales from prior periods may result from a negotiated agreement with a licensee that utilized our patented inventions prior to signing a patent license agreement with us or from the resolution of a disagreement or arbitration with a licensee over the specific terms of an existing license agreement 
we may also receive consideration for prior sales in connection with the settlement of patent litigation where there was no prior patent license agreement 
in each of these cases  we record the consideration as revenue when we have obtained a signed agreement  identified a fixed or determinable price and determined that collectability is reasonably assured 
fixed fee royalty payments up front  non refundable royalty payments that fulfill the licensee s obligations to us under a patent license agreement  for a specified time period or for the term of the agreement 
we recognize revenues related to fixed fee royalty payments on a straight line basis over the effective term of the license 
we utilize the straight line method because we cannot reliably predict in which periods  within the term of a license  the licensee will benefit from the use of our patented inventions 
prepayments up front  non refundable royalty payments towards a licensee s future obligations to us related to its expected sales of covered products in future periods 
our licensees obligations to pay royalties extend beyond the exhaustion of their prepayment balance 
once a licensee exhausts its prepayment balance  we may provide them with the opportunity to make another prepayment toward future sales or it will be required to make current royalty payments 
current royalty payments royalty payments covering a licensee s obligations to us related to its sales of covered products in the current contractual reporting period 
licensees that either owe us current royalty payments or have prepayment balances provide us with quarterly or semi annual royalty reports that summarize their sales of covered products and their related royalty obligations to us 
we typically receive these royalty reports subsequent to the period in which our licensees underlying sales occurred 
we recognize revenue in the period in which the royalty report is received and other revenue recognition criteria are met due to the fact that without royalty reports from our licensees  our visibility into our licensees sales is very limited 
the exhaustion of prepayments and current royalty payments are often calculated based on related per unit sales of covered products 
from time to time  licensees will not report revenues in the proper period  most often due to legal disputes  when this occurs  the timing and comparability of royalty revenue could be affected 
in cases where we receive objective  verifiable evidence that a licensee has discontinued sales of products covered under a patent license agreement with us  we recognize any related deferred revenue balance in the period that we receive such evidence 
during  we recognized revenue of million related to unpaid patent licensee royalties 
we based our recognition of this revenue on royalty reports received  despite the fact that the licensee had expressed its belief that it did not have a current payment obligation 
we believed that we were entitled to these royalty payments and the eventual collection of these amounts was reasonably assured  we subsequently collected these amounts in technology solutions revenue technology solutions revenue consists primarily of revenue from software licenses and engineering services 
software license revenues are recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop software revenue recognition and sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition 
when the arrangement with a customer includes significant production  modification or customization of the software  we recognize the related revenue using the percentage of completion method in accordance with sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
under this method  revenue and profit are recognized throughout the term of the contract  based on actual labor costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated labor costs related to the contract 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
when such estimates indicate that costs will exceed future revenues and a loss on the contract exists  a provision for the entire loss is recognized at that time 
we recognize revenues associated with engineering service arrangements that are outside the scope of sop on a straight line basis under sab no 
 unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned in a different pattern  over the contractual term of the arrangement or the expected period during which those specified services will be performed  whichever is longer 
in such cases we often recognize revenue using proportional performance and measure the progress of our performance based on the relationship between incurred labor hours and total estimated labor hours or other measures of progress  if available 
our most significant cost has been labor and we believe both labor hours and labor cost provide a measure of the progress of our services 
the effect of changes to total estimated contract costs is recognized in the period such changes are determined 
when technology solutions agreements include royalty payments  we recognize revenue from the royalty payments using the same methods described above under our policy for recognizing revenue from patent license agreements 
deferred charges from time to time  we use sales agents to assist us in our licensing activities 
in such cases  we may pay a commission 
the commission rate varies from agreement to agreement 
commissions are normally paid shortly after our receipt of cash payments associated with the patent license agreements 
we defer recognition of commission expense related to both prepayments and fixed fee royalty payments and amortize these expenses in proportion to our recognition of the related revenue 
in  and  we paid cash commissions of approximately million  million and million and recognized commission expense of million  million  and million  respectively  as part of patent administration and licensing expense 
at december   and we had deferred commission expense of approximately million  million and million  respectively  included within prepaid and other current assets and million  million and million  respectively  included within other non current assets 
compensation programs we use a variety of compensation programs to both attract and retain employees and more closely align employee compensation with company performance 
these programs include  but are not limited to  an annual bonus tied to performance goals  cash awards to inventors for filed patent applications and patent issuances  restricted stock unit rsu awards for non managers and a long term compensation program ltcp for managers that includes both time and performance based rsus and a performance based cash incentive component 
the ltcp is designed to have three year cycles that overlap by one year 
the cycles relevant to the reporting period are cash cycle a a long term performance cash incentive covering the period july  through january  rsu cycle rsus granted on january   which vest on or before january  rsu cycle rsus granted on january   which vest on or before january  cash cycle a long term performance cash incentive covering the period january  through january  we recognized share based compensation expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the majority of the share based compensation expense  for all years  related to rsu awards granted to managers under our ltcp 
in  share based compensation expense also included a non recurring charge of million to correct our accounting related to share based grants awarded to two non employee  non director consultants in we previously accounted for these non employee grants similarly to share based employee grants  using the intrinsic value method 
the charge reflects the incremental cost that would have been recognized by correctly treating these grants as non employee grants using the fair value method 
we also recognized million  million and million of compensation expense in  and  respectively  related to the performance based cash incentive under our ltcp 
the amount includes a fourth quarter charge of million to increase our accrual for cycle a from the previously estimated payout of to the actual payout of 
the increase in the incentive payout was driven by the company s success in achieving a number of key goals  including signing lg and samsung  two of the top five cellular handset oems  to g licensing agreements 
these licenses helped increase our share of the g market under license from approximately to approximately  and drove substantial positive operating cash flow over the period 
due to the charge to adjust the accrual rate on cycle a and the structure of the different cycles in the ltcp  we expect that expenses associated with the performance based cash incentive and rsus will be approximately million less than however  the amount recorded could either increase or decrease dependent upon both the number of employees that qualify for the ltcp and our future assessment of the expected attainment of pre established performance goals 
at december   accrued compensation expense associated with the ltcp s performance based cash incentive was based on an actual payout of for cycle a and an estimated payout of for cash cycle under the program  achievement of the goals set by the compensation committee of the board of directors results in a payout of the performance based cash incentive target amounts 
for each change above or below achievement  the payout is adjusted by percentage points with a maximum payout of and no payout for performance that falls below of target results 
the following table provides examples of the performance based cash incentive payout that would be earned based on various levels of goal achievement goal achievement payout less than or greater if we had assumed that goal achievement for cash cycle would be either or  we would have accrued either million more or less  respectively  of related compensation expense through december  however  our estimated accrual could either increase or decrease in the future dependent upon our future assessment of the expected attainment against pre established performance goals 
during  fourteen members of our senior management voluntarily exchanged approximately  cycle time based rsus for an equal number of cycle performance based rsus 
the company ultimately satisfied these performance based rsus in early through the issuance of approximately  shares  based upon senior management s performance against specified goals 
during  the ltcp was amended such that  beginning with the january  grant  executives now receive of their rsu grant as performance based rsus and as time based 
under the amendment the company s managers now receive of their rsu grant as performance based rsus and as time based 
under the program  achievement of the goals set by the compensation committee of the board of directors results in a payout of the performance based rsu incentive target amounts 
for each change above or below achievement  the payout is adjusted by percentage points with a maximum payout of 
for performance that falls below of target  no share payout would occur 
the following table provides examples of the performance based rsu payout that would be earned based on various levels of goal achievement goal achievement payout less than or greater at december   we did not meet the criteria specified by sfas no 
r to accrue performance based equity compensation associated with the cycle rsu grant 
if we had met the criteria  we would have accrued million of related compensation expense through december  we will establish an accrual for these performance rsus in the future if our future assessment of the expected attainment against pre established performance goals meets certain criteria for performance based share compensation established by sfas no 
r 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if management has determined that it is more likely than not  that such assets will not be realized 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to examinations by the internal revenue service irs and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters  including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings 
in the event that the irs or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future  it is possible the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
effective january  the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this interpretation clarifies the criteria for recognizing income tax benefits under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and requires additional disclosures about uncertain tax positions 
under fin the financial statement recognition of the benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable tax authority 
if this threshold is met  the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adopted fin  on january  as a result of the implementation  we recognized a million increase to reserves for uncertain tax positions 
this increase  related to federal tax credits  was accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings on the balance sheet 
including this cumulative effect adjustment  on january  we had million of net federal tax benefits that  if recognized  would reduce our effective income tax rate in the period recognized 
prior to the adoption of fin  we accrued for tax contingencies that have met both the probable and reasonably estimable criteria 
in the event that the irs or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future  it is possible the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
new accounting standards sfas no

sfas no 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value in an attempt to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
sfas no 
was effective for us beginning january  the company s adoption of sfas no 
on january  did not materially affect its financial position or results of operations  as the company did not elect the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas no

early application is not permitted 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this fsp to our consolidated statements of income 
legal proceedings we are routinely involved in disputes associated with enforcement and licensing activities regarding our intellectual property  including litigations and other proceedings 
these litigations and other proceedings are important means to enforce our intellectual property rights 
a january settlement of various litigations and other proceedings with samsung resulted in a million patent license agreement 
we are a party to other disputes and legal actions not related to our intellectual property  but also arising in the ordinary course of our business 
refer to item of part i of this form k for a complete description of our material legal proceedings 
financial position  liquidity and capital requirements our primary sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as well as  cash generated from operations 
we have the ability to obtain additional liquidity through debt and equity financings but have not had a significant debt or equity financing in over ten years and do not anticipate a need for such financings in based on our past performance and current expectations  we believe our available sources of funds  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations  capital requirements and any stock repurchase programs that we may initiate in although our existing revenue streams have been affected by the recent global economic downturn  as more fully discussed in the business portion of item  our near term revenues are partially insulated from market swings since of our recurring patent license revenues were based on fixed payments in  and that proportion is expected to increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  and  we had the following amounts of cash  and cash equivalents and short term investments in thousands december  cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million in the decrease was primarily due to our repurchase of million of our common stock and million of capital investments for the purchase of property  equipment and technology licenses and patent filing costs 
these items were partly offset by cash from operations of million 
we regularly review our cash and short term investment positions 
we have not identified any material impairment in our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents or short term investments  although  the overall rate of return on our portfolio has decreased along with the interest rates on the investments within the portfolio 
cash flows from operations we generated the following cash flows from our operating activities in and in thousands net cash provided by operating activities the positive operating cash flow in arose principally from receipts of approximately million related to g and g patent licensing agreements 
these receipts included the final million installment from lg under our patent license agreement  current royalty payments of million from sharp corporation of japan sharp and million from nec corporation of japan nec based on the royalty reports they submitted during the period 
we received prepayments  fixed payments and current royalties totaling million from other licensees 
these receipts were partially offset by cash operating expenses operating expenses less depreciation of fixed assets  amortization of intangible assets and non cash compensation of million  cash payments for foreign source withholding taxes of million  estimated federal income tax payments of million and changes in working capital during the positive operating cash flow in arose principally from receipts of approximately million related to g and g patent licensing agreements 
these receipts included million from lg  million from sharp  million from nec  million from other licensees that signed new or amended patent license agreements in and million from other existing licensees 
these receipts were partially offset by cash operating expenses operating expenses less depreciation of fixed assets  amortization of intangible assets and non cash compensation of million  cash payments for foreign source withholding taxes of million and changes in working capital during working capital we believe that working capital  adjusted to exclude cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  current maturities of debt and current deferred revenue  provides additional information about assets and liabilities that may affect our near term liquidity 
the following table reconciles our working capital to our adjusted working capital at december  and in thousands december  current assets current liabilities working capital subtract add cash and cash equivalents short term investments current portion of long term debt current deferred revenue adjusted working capital the million decrease in adjusted working capital is primarily due to the collection of lg s final installment of million in and an increase in accrued compensation accruals of million  primarily due to our long term cash incentive 
these decreases to adjusted working capital were partially offset by a million decrease in account payable  approximately two thirds of which related to our posting of a bond in the federal matter refer to federal within item of part i of this form k for more information and a million reduction in taxes payable associated with foreign withholding taxes paid upon the collection of the final lg installment 
we obtained net cash from investing activities of million in and used net cash from investing activities of million in we sold million and million of short term marketable securities  net of purchases  in and  respectively 
this increase was driven by our respective cash needs for each period and contributed to an million increase in cash and cash equivalents in purchases of property and equipment decreased to million in from million in due to the high levels of development tools and engineering needed in to enhance our network infrastructure and systems 
we also paid million and million in and  respectively  toward technology licenses necessary for our slimchip product family 
investment costs associated with patents increased from million in to million in this increase reflects higher patent application activity over the past several years  combined with the lag effect between filing an initial patent application and the incurrence of costs to issue the patent in both the us and foreign jurisdictions 
net cash used in financing activities decreased million primarily due to a million decrease in the amount of stock we repurchased in we also received million and million less in respective contributions from option and or warrant exercises and tax benefits from share based compensation as compared to the prior year 
other our combined short term and long term deferred revenue balance at december  was approximately million  a decrease of million from december  in  we recorded gross increases in deferred revenue of million  million related to new prepayments from new and existing licensees and million related to an accrued receivable from an existing licensee 
the gross increases in deferred revenue were more than offset by deferred revenue recognition of million related to the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments  million related to per unit exhaustion of prepaid royalties based upon royalty reports provided by our licensees and the recognition of deferred revenue related to technology solutions agreements 
in  based on current license agreements  we expect the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments to reduce the december  deferred revenue balance of million by million 
additional reductions to deferred revenue will be dependent upon the level of per unit royalties our licensees report against prepaid balances 
at december  and  we had approximately million options outstanding that had exercise prices less than the fair market value of our stock at each balance sheet date 
these options would have generated cash proceeds to the company of million and million  respectively  if they had been fully exercised

the balance of this increase and the decrease in share based compensation were both due to the structure of our ltcp which resulted in overlapping rsu cycles in and overlapping performance based cash incentive cycles in patent amortization increased due to heightened levels of internal inventive activity in recent years resulting in the expansion of our patent portfolio 
other depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to acquisitions of tools and technology licenses over the last two years associated with our slimchip product family
