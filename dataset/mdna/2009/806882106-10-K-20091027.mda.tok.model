item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section includes a discussion of the company s operations for the three fiscal years ended august  the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based on management s plans that are subject to uncertainty 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto  and the selected financial data and operating statistics contained elsewhere in this form k 
business the company operates in three reportable segments mrb  apb and smb  which collectively provide an end of life cycle solution for a variety of products through the company s integrated businesses 
corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated expense for management and administrative services that benefit all three business segments 
as a result of this unallocated expense  the operating income loss of each segment does not reflect the operating income loss the segment would have as a stand alone business 
for further information regarding the company s segments  including financial information about geographic areas  refer to note segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
mrb purchases  collects  processes  recycles  sells and brokers ferrous scrap metal containing iron to foreign and domestic steel producers  including smb  and nonferrous scrap metal not containing iron to both domestic and export markets 
mrb processes large pieces of scrap metal into smaller pieces by sorting  shearing  shredding and torching  resulting in scrap metal processed into pieces of a size  density and purity required by customers to meet their production needs 
apb purchases used and salvaged vehicles primarily from tow companies  private parties  auto auctions  charities  and city contracts  and sells serviceable used auto parts from these vehicles through its self service  full service and hybrid auto parts stores 
the remaining portions of the vehicles  primarily autobodies  cores and nonferrous materials  are sold to metal recyclers  including mrb where geographically feasible 
smb operates a steel mini mill that produces a wide range of finished steel products 
smb purchases substantially all of its recycled metal requirements from mrb at rates that approximate west coast export market prices and uses its eaf mini mill near portland  oregon  to melt recycled metal and other raw materials to produce finished steel products 
smb also maintains mill depots in central and southern california 
the company s results of operations depend in large part on demand and prices for recycled metal in global and domestic markets and steel products in the western us the company s deep water port facilities on both the east and west coasts of the us in everett  massachusetts  oakland  california  portland  oregon  and tacoma  washington and access to port facilities in rhode island  hawaii and puerto rico allow the company to meet the demand for recycled metal by steel manufacturers located in europe  asia  central america and africa 
the company s processing facilities in the southeastern us also provide access to the automobile and steel manufacturing industries in that region 
periodically  fluctuating or volatile supply and demand conditions affect market prices for and volumes of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal in global markets and for steel products in the western us and can have a significant impact on the results of operations for all three operating segments  as can freight rates and the availability of transportation 
key factors and trends affecting the industries in which the company operates and its results of operations the following key factors and trends affect the industries in which the company operates worldwide production and consumption of steel products  general economic conditions  competition  consolidation in the scrap metal and the steel industries  fragmentation of the auto parts industry and volatility in selling prices of the company s products and the purchase prices of raw materials  including scrap metal

executive overview during fiscal  the company faced difficult market conditions  including an unprecedented drop in the demand for recycled metals and finished steel products 
the onset of the weak economic environment and the worldwide financial crisis resulted in a rapid and steep drop in both sales volumes and sales prices from those experienced in the previous fiscal year in all of the company s operating segments that resulted in a charge of million to reduce inventory to net realizable value in the first quarter 
in the face of this environment  the company undertook a series of actions to adjust its costs and production levels to meet the lower demand that included the implementation of a cost containment program which included reducing production output  lowering purchase costs  reducing full time headcount  and lowering selling  general and administrative expenses sg a costs  incentive compensation and outside services 
by reducing production output to match lower demand and lowering its cost structure accordingly including an reduction of it s full time workforce  the company was able to significantly reduce controllable production and sg a costs 
by controlling costs  reducing inventory levels and actively managing the cash spreads between the selling prices for recycled metal and steel products and the cost of purchasing raw materials as well as benefiting from an uptick in sales volume in the fourth quarter  the company was able to generate sequentially improving quarterly operating results see graph of operating income loss below and positive operating cash flows during the year of million  a million increase over the prior fiscal year 
these initiatives have strengthened the company s ability to weather the current market environment 
the following graph presents operating income loss by quarter for fiscal in thousands logo corporate expense and intercompany eliminations are included in the consolidated results

table of contents the company also completed four acquisitions during fiscal that expanded its mrb operations into puerto rico and further enhanced its position on the west coast and its auto parts business presence in northern california see note business combinations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the company was able to make these acquisitions and additional capital improvements while reducing debt  net of cash  from million at august  to million at august  refer to non gaap financial measures below 
in october  the company completed the acquisition of four self service used auto parts facilities and the sale of its full service used auto parts operation to lkq corporation 
the self service operations are located near the company s metals recycling business export facility located in portland  oregon and represent the company s first used auto parts operations in the pacific northwest 
the company s acquisition of two additional facilities  which will increase the number of used auto parts facilities that the company operates in the dallas fort worth metroplex to four  is expected to be effective in january all of the acquired facilities will operate under the company s pick n pull brand

included in the operating loss was the million inventory change discussed above  which was offset by a million reduction in sg a expenses compared to fiscal this decrease in sg a expenses was primarily due to lower compensation related expenses  including incentive compensation  and reduced expenses resulting from cost containment measures which reduced headcount and other non compensation related costs 
also included in the operating loss was a million gain due to a settlement agreement to resolve disputes that had arisen from the hugo neu separation and termination agreement see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
other income expense for increased by million when compared to the same period in fiscal  primarily due to the settlement agreement discussed above and a million reduction in interest expense 
mrb generated revenues of billion  a billion decrease from fiscal this included a billion  or  decrease in ferrous revenues and a million  or  decrease in nonferrous revenues 
the decrease in ferrous revenues was driven by a decrease in average net selling price for ferrous and a decrease in ferrous sales volumes 
ferrous volumes in fiscal decreased due to lower demand and reduced availability of raw materials arising from weaker global market conditions 
the decrease in nonferrous revenues was driven by a decrease in the average net sales price  and a decrease in pounds sold due to lower demand and reduced availability of raw materials 
mrb had operating income of million  compared to million in fiscal apb generated revenues of million  an million decrease from fiscal the decrease over prior year was driven by a million decrease in scrap vehicle revenue due to lower sales volume and prices  a million decrease in core revenue due to lower sales volumes and prices  and a million decrease in parts revenues

table of contents mrb sells recycled ferrous metal to smb at rates per ton that approximate export prices 
in addition  apb sells auto bodies to mrb 
these intercompany revenues and cost of goods sold are eliminated in consolidation 
corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated expenses for services that benefit all three business segments 
as a consequence of this unallocated expense  the operating income of each segment does not reflect the operating income the segment would have as a stand alone business 
the joint ventures sell recycled ferrous metal to mrb and then subsequently to smb at rates per ton that approximate west coast export market prices 
consequently  these intercompany revenues produce intercompany operating income loss  which is not recognized until the finished products are sold to third parties  therefore intercompany profit is eliminated while the products remain in inventory 
intercompany profits losses are not recognized until the finished products are sold to third parties  therefore intercompany profit is eliminated while the products remain in inventory 
revenues consolidated revenues for fiscal decreased billion  or  to billion compared to fiscal revenues in fiscal decreased for all business segments  primarily due to the worldwide economic crisis which reduced demand for scrap  recycled metal and finished steel products throughout the period 
this reduced demand resulted in lower scrap  recycled metal and finished steel sales volumes and lower average selling prices 
consolidated revenues for fiscal increased billion compared to fiscal revenues in fiscal increased for all company business segments  primarily as a result of increases in the market price of scrap metal and finished steel products  higher throughput at the company s processing and manufacturing facilities and the incremental impact of the businesses acquired during fiscal and operating income loss consolidated operating income loss decreased million to an operating loss of million for fiscal compared to consolidated operating income of million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  operating income loss decreased by percentage points for fiscal compared to fiscal weaker year over year demand and the impact of declines in anticipated future selling prices  which outpaced the decline in inventory costs  resulted in non cash nrv inventory write downs of million comprised of million at mrb  million at smb  and million that was eliminated in consolidation compared to million in fiscal this decrease in operating income loss was partially offset by a million release of environmental reserves and a million gain recognized in fiscal  primarily related to resolution of the hylebos waterway litigation see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report

the reduction in compensation related expenses was primarily due to a decrease in annual incentive and share based compensation expense resulting from operating losses incurred by the company and a million benefit arising from nondeductible executive incentive compensation that was awarded and included as nondeductible officers compensation for fiscal but was voluntarily and irrevocably declined in november the decline in professional services expense was primarily the result of reduced consulting fees in fiscal  compared to the prior year 
also included in the operating loss for fiscal was a million gain related to a settlement agreement to resolve disputes that had arisen from the separation and termination agreement relating to the dissolution of the company s joint venture with hugo neu in september these reductions were partially offset by a million increase in bad debt expense for fiscal compared to the prior year resulting from bankruptcies and adverse financial conditions experienced by certain of the company s customers  which affected their ability to satisfy their obligations

table of contents consolidated operating income increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to improved financial results in all business segments resulting from increases in market prices and higher sales volumes  which were partially offset by increases in the purchase costs of raw materials  including an nrv inventory adjustment of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and increases in consolidated sg a expense 
as a percentage of revenues  operating income increased by percentage points for fiscal compared to fiscal  mainly as a result of average selling prices increasing at a faster rate than the purchase costs of raw material 
consolidated sg a expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in consolidated sg a expense for fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in compensation related expenses  including annual incentive compensation expense  principally due to the company s improved financial and operating performance and increased headcount resulting from the incremental impact of growth during fiscal and fiscal  a million increase in share based compensation expense  primarily due to an increased number of participants and an additional year of performance share grants under the company s stock incentive plan  a million increase in professional service costs and a million increase in marketing and advertising costs 
interest expense interest expense was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease from fiscal to is the result of lower average interest rates and the company carrying significantly lower average debt balances during the period 
for more information about the company s outstanding debt balances  see note long term debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
other income  net  excluding interest expense other income was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
other income increased by million in fiscal compared to the prior year because in the company recorded a pre tax gain of million that primarily arose from a settlement agreement to resolve disputes that had arisen from the separation and termination agreement relating to the dissolution of the company s joint venture with hugo neu in september for a more detailed discussion of this agreement  see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
income tax expense in fiscal  the company recorded an income tax benefit on its pre tax loss before income taxes and minority interests 
the effective tax rate benefit was  compared to an expense of in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal reflects the following the tax effect of the loss  the reversal of million of nondeductible executive incentive compensation expense  the lower foreign tax rate on permanently reinvested foreign earnings  a reduction in contingent state tax liabilities  and a reduction of previously claimed internal revenue code section manufacturing deductions 
the executive incentive compensation was treated as nondeductible in fiscal  and was voluntarily and irrevocably declined in fiscal  resulting in non taxable income 
the foreign earnings were earned by the puerto rico metals recycling operation acquired in february and were treated as permanently reinvested in puerto rico  and therefore no us tax was provided on them 
the contingent state tax liabilities were reduced because a settlement was negotiated with one state and statute of limitations expired in two other states 
the section expense primarily represents the estimated reduction in fiscal section benefits that will result from the carry back of the fiscal net operating loss to that earlier year 
the income tax benefit for fiscal was also decreased by other items  none individually material  including adjustments arising out of ongoing tax audits 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal was comparable to the effective tax rate for fiscal financial results by segment the company operates its business across three reportable segments mrb  apb and smb

this decrease was primarily attributable to lower average net sales prices and lower sales volumes  caused by lower demand and reduced availability of raw materials due to weaker global market conditions in fiscal ferrous revenues decreased billion  or  to billion during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the decrease in ferrous revenues was driven by reductions in ferrous sales volumes and lower average net selling prices 
ferrous sales volumes decreased million tons  or  to million tons in fiscal  compared to fiscal ferrous export sales volumes decreased  tons  or  to million tons for fiscal compared to fiscal due to a reduction in trading volumes 
ferrous domestic sales volumes decreased  tons  or  to  tons in fiscal compared to prior year 
these decreases in volume were primarily due to a combination of lower demand and reduced availability of raw materials 
the company also experienced declining prices during the year as the average net ferrous sales price decreased per long ton  or  compared to the prior year  due to lower demand and weaker global market conditions 
nonferrous revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the decrease in nonferrous revenues was primarily driven by a decrease in the average nonferrous net sales price and sales volumes  caused by lower demand and weaker global market conditions

fiscal compared with fiscal revenues mrb generated revenues of billion for fiscal before intercompany eliminations  an increase of million over fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to higher selling prices for ferrous and nonferrous metal due to strong worldwide demand for scrap metal and higher ferrous processed and nonferrous volumes due to the company s focus on increasing throughput and the incremental impact of the capacity growth experienced during fiscal and outbound freight costs  which are included in the cost of sales  increased by to million for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased volumes and higher ocean freight rates 
schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents ferrous revenues increased million  during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase in ferrous revenues was driven by both higher average net selling prices and increased volumes 
the average net selling price for ferrous processing increased per ton  or  from fiscal to fiscal the average net selling price for ferrous trading increased per ton  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal processed ferrous sales volume increased by  tons during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily the result of the strategy to increase the volume of metal purchases and maximize throughput  which was accomplished through increased purchases of ferrous materials and increased production as a result of the company s investment in mega shredders 
trading ferrous sales volume decreased by  tons compared to fiscal primarily due to the company s focus on the higher margin processed ferrous and nonferrous operations and the lower quantities of scrap available for export in the baltic sea region 
nonferrous revenues increased million for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in nonferrous revenues was driven primarily by increased volumes 
nonferrous pounds shipped increased million pounds for fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase in pounds shipped was primarily due to improved recovery of nonferrous materials processed through the new mega shredders  which have state of the art back end sorting systems  the higher overall volume being processed at the company s facilities  greater purchases of unprocessed materials and the incremental impact of capacity growth experienced during fiscal and the average net selling price remained relatively consistent in fiscal and fiscal certain nonferrous metals are a byproduct of the shredding process  and quantities available for shipment are affected by the volume of materials processed through the company s shredders 
segment operating income operating income for mrb was million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue reflects the impact of the higher net selling prices for ferrous and nonferrous metal  which outpaced increased costs for freight and raw materials  and increased processed ferrous and nonferrous volumes 
in addition  income from joint ventures increased by million  or  over the prior year  primarily due to the strong demand for scrap metal 
included in cost of goods sold was a million nrv adjustment to reduce the value of inventory as of august  to the lower of cost or market resulting from a significant decline in the future selling prices of scrap metal that began in the second half of the fiscal fourth quarter 
further offsetting the increases in average selling prices and volume was a million increase in sg a expenses compared to the prior year  primarily due to million of higher compensation related expenses  including annual incentive compensation expense  resulting from the company s improved financial and operating performance and increased headcount resulting from the incremental capacity growth experienced during fiscal and  a million increase in professional and outside services  and a million increase in share based compensation expense 
outlook despite the weakened economic conditions which existed during most of fiscal  mrb believes that the long term fundamentals supporting the demand for recycled metals remain positive 
during the second half of fiscal  demand in the developing world began to improve  however  the outlook for both the export and domestic markets in fiscal remains highly uncertain  and the company is currently unable to provide any guidance for prices and volumes for the fiscal year as a whole 
the company believes these conditions will not improve materially until such time as the global economic environment improves

outlook in general  the results for apb are highly dependent upon both the supply and cost of scrapped vehicles  which are in turn a function of overall economic conditions in the us and canada 
while the availability of scrapped vehicles has recently improved from levels seen during most of fiscal  the supply remains more difficult to obtain than during periods before the recent economic downturn 
as a result the cost to acquire an adequate supply of vehicles has not declined as much as the core and scrap revenues generated from processing and selling those vehicles 
the company believes these conditions will not improve materially until such time as the economic environment in the us and canada improves 
in october  the company completed the acquisition of four self service used auto parts facilities and the sale of its full service used auto parts operation to lkq corporation 
the self service operations are located near the company s metals recycling business export facility located in portland  oregon and represent the company s first used auto parts operations in the pacific northwest 
the company s acquisition of two additional facilities  which will increase the number of used auto parts facilities that the company operates in the dallas fort worth metroplex to four  is expected to be effective in january all of the acquired facilities will operate under the company s pick n pull brand 
the acquisition of these six self service stores will increase the number of self service stores to as a result of the sale of the full service operation and subject to performance of the self service operations  the company expects segment revenue to decline and operating income to improve  as the full service operations had revenues of million and an operating loss of million in fiscal which will be eliminated going forward 
subject to the completion of purchase accounting  in the first quarter of fiscal the company expects the loss on the sale to be not less than million  which will primarily reflect the write off of goodwill 
in the past  apb s business was not affected by seasonal trends  as the seasonal spikes experienced in the summer months in the self service business tended to offset the seasonal spikes experienced in the winter months in the full service business 
in the absence of the full service business offset going forward  the company expects that the results of apb will become more seasonal  with sales increasing in the third and fourth quarters  subject to prevailing economic conditions

fiscal compared with fiscal revenues smb generated revenues of million for fiscal  an increase of million over fiscal the increase over the prior year was the result of higher average net selling prices for finished steel products and increased sales volumes as smb was able to use its increased production capacity to take advantage of a lower supply of imported steel products to increase sales in the west coast steel markets 
the average net selling price increased per ton to per ton in fiscal compared to fiscal and contributed increased revenues of million 
the increase in the average finished goods selling prices was the result of a significant reduction in imported steel caused by strong overseas demand and the weaker us dollar  which created a tight supply of steel products for domestic customers 
finished goods sales volume increased  tons in fiscal compared to the prior year due to the factors discussed above and resulted in increased revenues of million 
segment operating income operating income for smb was million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in operating income was due to higher selling prices and increased volumes  which was partially offset by higher costs for scrap metal and other raw materials

smb acquired substantially all of its scrap metal requirements from mrb at rates that approximate west coast export market prices 
outlook smb sells its products primarily to construction markets located on the west coast of the us and competes against both domestic and foreign steel manufacturers 
as the economic downturn continues to hamper construction spending  demand for smb s finished steel products is expected to remain soft in fiscal  with sales volumes and margins heavily dependent upon the timing and strength of the us economic recovery and the company is currently unable to provide any guidance for prices and volumes for the fiscal year as a whole

net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in fiscal included million in capital expenditures to upgrade the company s equipment and infrastructure and million in acquisitions completed in fiscal the increase in outflows for investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily related to capital expenditures and significant acquisitions that occurred in fiscal net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million  compared to million of cash used in financing activities in fiscal and million of cash used in financing activities in fiscal the increase in cash used in financing activities from fiscal to was primarily due to an increase in debt repayments which were funded by higher levels of cash generation and the decrease from fiscal to was primarily due to a lower level of share repurchases 
credit facilities the company s short term borrowings consist primarily of a one year  unsecured  uncommitted million credit line with wells fargo bank  na that expires in march interest rates on outstanding indebtedness under the unsecured line of credit are set by the bank at the time of borrowing 
the company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of august   compared to million as of august  the company maintains a million revolving credit facility that matures in july pursuant to an unsecured committed bank credit agreement with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  and the other lenders party thereto

table of contents ratio 
as of august  and  the company had borrowings outstanding under the credit facility of million and million  respectively 
the two bank credit agreements contain various representations and warranties  events of default and financial and other covenants  including covenants regarding maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
as of august   the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
the company uses these credit facilities to fund share repurchases  acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
in addition  as of august  and  the company had million of long term bonded indebtedness that matures in january acquisitions the aggregate purchase price paid for acquisitions during fiscal was million  which includes cash acquired and amounts to be paid of million  compared to million for acquisitions in the prior year 
during fiscal  the company continued to expand its presence in regions in which it operates and in new locations through the acquisitions of value creating businesses 
see executive overview business acquisitions above 
capital expenditures capital expenditures totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company continued its investment in infrastructure improvement projects  including general improvements at a number of its metals recycling facilities  enhancements to the company s information technology infrastructure  investments in technology to improve the recovery of nonferrous materials from the shredding process and investments to further improve efficiency and increase capacity  increase worker safety and enhance environmental systems 
the company plans to invest million to million in capital expenditures in fiscal  of which million is expected to be spent on environmental compliance 
potential capital projects in fiscal are expected to include material handling and processing equipment  enhancements to the company s information technology infrastructure  improvements for the facilities  environmental and safety infrastructure  and continued investments in technology to improve the recovery of nonferrous materials from the shredding process and normal equipment replacement and maintenance 
the company believes these investments will create value for its shareholders 
the company expects to use cash from operations and available lines of credit to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions in fiscal share repurchase program pursuant to a share repurchase program as amended in and in october  the company was authorized to repurchase up to million shares of its class a common stock when management deems such repurchases to be appropriate 
management evaluates long and short range forecasts as well as anticipated sources and uses of cash before determining the course of action that would best enhance shareholder value 
prior to fiscal  the company had repurchased approximately million shares under the program 
in november  the company s board of directors approved an increase in the shares authorized for repurchase by million  to million 
in fiscal  the company repurchased a total of  shares under this program 
as a result  at august  there were approximately million shares available for repurchase under existing authorizations 
pension contributions the company makes contributions to a defined benefit pension plan  several defined contribution plans and several multi employer pension plans 
contributions vary depending on the plan and are based upon plan provisions  actuarial valuations and negotiated labor agreements 
in fiscal  the company froze further benefit accruals in its defined benefit plan 
however  recently most defined benefit plans have experienced deterioration in their funded status due to the general decline in investment values 
therefore  due to changes in the market and lower than expected returns on plan assets  the company made a million contribution to the defined benefit plan in fiscal the company does not anticipate making additional schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents contributions to the defined benefit plan in fiscal however  changes in the discount rate or actual investment returns which continue to remain lower than the long term expected return on plan assets  could result in the company making future additional contributions 
effective in march of fiscal  the company suspended employer contributions to its defined contribution plans 
resumption of these contributions will be based on a variety of factors  including company performance and overall economic conditions  and it is uncertain whether the company will make contributions to these plans in fiscal in addition  during fiscal the company anticipates making million of contributions to the multi employer plans  including a contribution of million for the multi employer plan benefiting union employees of smb 
the company believes any additional funding requirements would not have a material impact on its financial condition 
see note employee benefits in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further discussion of the company s retirement benefit plans 
assessment of liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s available cash resources  internally generated funds  credit facilities and equity offerings have financed its acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital and other financing needs 
the company generally believes its current cash resources  internally generated funds  existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide adequate financing for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital  joint ventures  stock repurchases  debt service requirements  post retirement obligations and future environmental obligations for the next months 
however  continued weak general market conditions may result in the company further utilizing its available credit lines and curtailing capital and operating expenditures  delaying or restricting acquisitions and share repurchases and reassessing working capital requirements 
should the company determine  at any time  that it requires additional short term liquidity  the company will evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds 
there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained  or if obtained  would be adequate or on terms acceptable to the company 
however  the company believes that its balance sheet at august  and the level of its existing credit facilities should provide additional sources of liquidity if required 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases  the company is not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

critical accounting policies and estimates the company has identified critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the company s portrayal of its financial condition and operating results 
these estimates require difficult and subjective judgments  including whether estimates are required to be made about matters that are inherently uncertain  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible asset valuation  environmental costs  assessment of the valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax contingencies  share based compensation assumptions  revenue recognition and fair value measurements 
inventories the company s inventories primarily consist of ferrous and nonferrous unprocessed metal  ferrous processed metal  nonferrous recovered joint product  used and salvaged vehicles and finished steel products consisting of rebar  coiled rebar  merchant bar and wire rod 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
mrb determines the cost of ferrous and nonferrous inventories principally using the average cost method and capitalizes substantially all direct costs and yard costs into inventory 
mrb allocates material and production costs to joint products using the gross margin method 
apb establishes cost for used and salvaged vehicle inventory based on the average price the company pays for a vehicle 
the self service business capitalizes only the vehicle cost into inventory  while the full service business capitalizes the vehicle cost  dismantling and  where applicable  storage and towing fees into inventory 
smb schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents establishes its finished steel product inventory cost based on a weighted average cost and capitalizes all direct and indirect costs of manufacturing into inventory 
indirect costs of manufacturing include general plant costs  maintenance  human resources and yard costs 
the company evaluates whether its inventory is properly valued at the lower of cost or market on a quarterly basis 
the company considers estimated future selling prices when determining the estimated net realizable value for its inventory 
however  as mrb generally sells its export recycled ferrous metal under contracts that provide for shipment within to days after the price is agreed  it utilizes the selling prices under committed contracts and sales orders for determining the estimated market price of quantities on hand that will be shipped under these contracts and orders 
the accounting process utilized by the company to record unprocessed metal and used and salvaged vehicle inventory quantities relies on significant estimates 
with respect to unprocessed metal inventory  the company relies on weighed quantities that are reduced by estimated amounts that are moved into production 
these estimates utilize estimated recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends 
over time  these estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced  however  actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality  moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal 
if ultimate recoveries and yields are significantly different than estimated  the value of the company s inventory could be materially overstated or understated 
to assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates  the company runs periodic tests and performs monthly physical inventory estimates 
however  due to variations in product density  holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product  physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances 
to mitigate this risk  the company adjusts its ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count can more accurately predict the remaining volume 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis during the second quarter of each fiscal year and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances indicating that the fair value of goodwill may be impaired 
the company assesses the existence of any indicators that imply a potential impairment on a monthly basis 
this assessment may include the following indicators  some of which involve a significant amount of judgment a significant reduction in the company s expected future cash flows  a significant sustained decline in the company s share price and market capitalization that is other than temporary  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  the impairment of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and an expectation that a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life  among other indicators 
an adverse change in any of these factors could potentially have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could result in a material impact on the company s consolidated results and future cash flows 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
the company has determined that its reporting units  for which goodwill has been allocated  are equivalent to the company s operating segments mrb  apb and smb  as all of the components of each segment have similar economic characteristics 
the goodwill impairment test follows a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
the company has allocated the corporate assets and liabilities to each reporting unit so that the carrying value of each reporting unit includes all assets and liabilities related to the operations of that reporting unit 
management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of a reporting unit  the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
in the event of a divestiture of a business unit within a reporting unit  goodwill of the reporting unit is allocated to that business unit based on the schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents fair value of the business unit being divested to the total fair value of the reporting unit and a gain or loss on the divestiture is determined 
the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit from which the assets were divested is subsequently re evaluated for impairment 
given that market prices of the company s reporting units are not readily available  the company makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units 
the company uses an income approach to determine fair value of its reporting units which is based on the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate 
the discount rate represents the weighted average cost of capital which is reflective of a market participant s view of fair value given current market conditions  expected rate of return  capital structure  debt costs  market volatility  peer company comparisons and equity risk premium and is believed to adequately reflect the overall inherent risk and uncertainty involved in the operations and industry of the reporting units 
to estimate the cash flows that extend beyond the final year of the discounted cash flow model  the company employs a terminal value technique  whereby the company uses estimated operating cash flows minus capital expenditures and adjusted for changes in working capital requirements in the final year of the model and discounts it by the risk adjusted discount rate to establish the terminal value 
the company includes the present value of the terminal value in the fair value estimate 
to assess the sensitivity of the projected future cash flows the results are stress tested based on different growth levels and economic cycles 
the determination of fair value requires that management apply significant judgment in formulating estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include forecasts of future cash flows based on management s best estimate of future sales and operating costs  pricing expectations  capital expenditures  working capital requirements  discount rates  growth rates  and general market conditions 
as a result of the inherent uncertainty associated with forming these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company performed its annual testing for impairment of goodwill 
as part of its assessment of the recovery of goodwill  the company conducted an extensive valuation analysis using an income approach with applied discount rates ranging from to for its reporting units 
the projections used in the income approach took into consideration current and projected future business cycles and did not project cash flows based upon historically high prices and volumes as experienced in fiscal based on the results of the first step of the company s annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill  the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values  indicating that there was no goodwill impairment 
the company considered what the impact of changes in the assumptions underlying its estimates of fair value would be on the determination of impairment 
the fair value of the reporting units would not fall below the carrying value if the forecasted cash flow were to decrease or the discount rate were to increase by two percentage points 
although the annual impairment testing performed in the second quarter of fiscal revealed that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value indicating no impairment  the market capitalization of the company based on the average trading price of the company s stock for the day period immediately preceding the quarter ended february  was determined to be below the carrying value of the company 
it is not uncommon  especially in a volatile market  that the observed market prices of individual trades of a company s shares and consequently the market capitalization calculated may not be representative of the fair value of the company as a whole 
however  it is common in most industries that an acquiring entity is generally willing to pay more for equity securities that will give the acquiring entity a controlling interest as opposed to what an investor that would pay for equity securities that represent less than a controlling interest  and thus additional value appears to result from an acquiring entity s ability to take advantage of the many benefits that arise from control over another entity 
as part of the overall assessment of the recoverability of goodwill  the company s fair value was determined to be higher than its market capitalization when a reasonable control premium was taken into account 
the control premium used by the company was considered to be within the range of control premiums paid in recent acquisitions within the steel and scrap recycling sectors and recent acquisitions in other sectors since major declines in share prices arose from the current economic cycle 
schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents on october   the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the company s full service used auto parts operation  which had been operated as part of the apb reporting unit 
the company identified this divestiture as a triggering event  which resulted in testing goodwill for impairment 
based on the company s valuation analysis performed in relation to the divestiture of the full service operations  the company determined that the goodwill related to apb was not impaired at august  the company will continue to monitor its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible and long lived assets for possible future impairment 
environmental costs the company operates in industries that inherently possess environmental risks 
to manage these risks  the company employs both its own environmental staff and outside consultants 
environmental staff and finance personnel meet regularly to stay updated on environmental risks 
the company estimates future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrues for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated 
the regulatory and government management of these projects is complex  which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation 
when only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than another  the low end of the range is recorded in the financial statements 
if further developments or resolution of an environmental matter result in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these reserves  the accrual for environmental remediation could be materially understated or overstated 
adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or when expenditures for which reserves are established are made 
the factors which the company considers in its recognition and measurement of environmental liabilities include the following current regulations  both at the time the reserve is established and during the course of the remediation process  which specify standards for acceptable remediation  information about the site which becomes available as the site is studied and remediated  the professional judgment of senior level internal staff  who take into account similar  recent instances of environmental remediation issues  and studies of the company s sites  among other considerations  technologies available that can be used for remediation  and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties and the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 
deferred taxes deferred income taxes reflect the differences at fiscal year end between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates 
tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises 
periodically  the company reviews its deferred tax assets to assess whether a valuation allowance is necessary 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent the assets are more likely than not to be unrealized 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 
if the ultimate realization of the company s deferred tax assets is significantly different than the expectations  the value of the company s deferred tax assets could be materially overstated 
the company established a valuation allowance of less than million at august  for state tax credits that may expire before they are used 
share based compensation the company recognizes compensation expense  net of a forfeiture rate  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the three year performance period for performance based shares 
the company estimated the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility  which is based on historical month end closing stock prices 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and the company uses different assumptions  the company s share based compensation expense for performance based awards could be materially different in the future 
if the company s actual payout assumption is materially different from its estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the company has recorded in the current period 
if the pay out assumption changed by  share based compensation related to performance awards would increase or decrease by million 
see note share based compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when the company has a contract or purchase order from a customer with a fixed price  the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
title for both scrap metal and finished steel products transfers upon shipment  based on shipping terms 
a significant portion of the company s ferrous export sales of recycled metal are made with letters of credit  reducing credit risk 
however  domestic recycled ferrous metal sales  nonferrous sales and sales of finished steel are generally made on open account 
nonferrous export sales typically require a deposit prior to shipment 
for retail sales by apb  revenues are recognized when customers pay for parts or when wholesale products are shipped to the customer location 
additionally  the company recognizes revenues on partially loaded shipments when detailed documents support revenue recognition based on transfer of title and risk of loss 
historically  there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that impact the ultimate collection of revenues  therefore  no material provisions have been made when the sale is recognized 
fair value measurements on september   the company adopted the accounting standards which defined fair value 
fair value is measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy 
classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the three levels are described as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets 
level directly and indirectly observable market data 
level unobservable inputs with no market data correlation 
the company uses quoted market prices whenever available  or seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when quoted market prices are not available  when developing fair value measurements 
the company s only financial instrument subject to fair value measurement is its outstanding natural gas contract level for the steel manufacturing business  which is measured at fair value using a model derived from observable market data 
this model considers various inputs including a quoted futures prices for commodities  b time value  and c the company s credit risk  as well as other relevant economic measures

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the company is exposed to commodity price risk  mainly associated with variations in the market price for finished steel products  ferrous and nonferrous metal  including scrap  autobodies and other commodities 
the timing and magnitude of industry cycles are difficult to predict and are impacted by general economic conditions 
the company responds to changes in recycled metal selling prices by adjusting purchase prices on a timely basis and by turning rather than holding inventory in expectation of higher prices 
the company actively manages its exposure to commodity price risk and monitors the actual and expected spread between forward selling prices and purchase costs and processing and shipping expense 
sales contracts are based on spot market prices  and generally orders are placed to days ahead of shipment date 
however  financial results may be negatively impacted when selling prices fall faster than adjustments to purchase prices or average inventory costs can be made  when customers fail to meet their contractual obligations or when levels of inventory have an anticipated net realizable value that is below average cost 
if smb s estimate of finished steel product selling prices per ton decreased by  based on inventory on hand at august   there would be a non cash nrv write down of million within the smb segment 
the company is also exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market prices for natural gas  most significantly related to smb s energy requirements for its steel mini mill facility 
the company s risk strategy associated with the purchase of commodities utilized within its production processes has generally been to make certain commitments with suppliers relating to future and expected requirements for such commodities 
smb has a take or pay natural gas contract based on fixed prices that expires on may  and obligates it to purchase minimum quantities per day through october  whether or not the amount is utilized 
as of august  the fair value of the natural gas contract derivative and the unrealized loss was million  compared to million at august  the fair value of the natural gas contract derivative is determined using a forward price curve based on observable market price quotations at a major natural gas trading hub 
the company s valuation model is updated monthly to reflect current market information 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in forward market prices for contracted volumes would have changed the fair value at august  by less than million 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related to its debt obligations 
the company s credit line and revolving credit facility are variable in rate and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates 
if market interest rates had changed from actual interest rate levels in fiscal or  the effect on the company s interest expense and net income would not have been material 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that might occur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations to take delivery of scrap metal and finished steel products and to make financial settlements of these obligations 
the company extends credit based on a variety of methods  including letters of credit on ferrous scrap exports  establishment of credit limits for a proportion of sales on open terms  collection of deposits for certain nonferrous export customers and open terms 
mrb generally ships ferrous bulk sales to foreign customers under contracts supported by letters of credit issued or confirmed by banks deemed credit worthy by the company 
the letters of credit ensure payment by the customer 
as mrb generally sells its export recycled ferrous metal under contracts or orders that generally provide for shipment within to days after the price is agreed  mrb s customers typically do not have difficulty obtaining letters of credit from their banks in periods of rising ferrous prices  as the value of the letters of credit are collateralized by the value of the inventory on the ship 
however  in periods of declining prices  mrb s customers may not be able to obtain letters of credit for the full sales value of the inventory to be shipped 
as such  the company may need to extend credit on open terms for the difference between the sales value under the contract and the value supported by the letter of credit 
in addition  the company could be exposed to loss if a customer fails to pay or the bank providing the letter of credit fails
