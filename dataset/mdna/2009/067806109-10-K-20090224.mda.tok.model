item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during the fourth quarter of  the company changed its organizational structure by aligning its strategic business units with a focus on core functional and delivery capabilities 
this realignment resulted in two new reportable business segments logistics and manufacturing services  and precision components 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of the company exited certain non core businesses within its logistics and manufacturing services segment in the united kingdom 
these actions included selling certain assets of the operation and exiting the businesses 
the results of these businesses have been segregated and treated as discontinued operations 
all previously reported financial information has been adjusted on a retrospective basis to reflect the segment realignment and the discontinued operations for all years presented 
highlights in  deteriorating worldwide economic conditions caused significant volatility in many markets which adversely impacted our business 
the distribution business of the logistics and manufacturing services segment was negatively affected by weakening demand across many of its end markets while the aerospace aftermarket business continued to be negatively impacted by deferred airline maintenance and lower capacity usage 
the domestic industrial manufacturing businesses of the precision components segment were impacted most significantly by the severe declines in the transportation end market and its aerospace oem business was impacted by the boeing labor strike and the production slide in a major engine program 
as a result of this volatility  sales decreased in both business segments and were down to  million company wide 
the company took a number of actions within each of the businesses primarily in the fourth quarter of to reduce overhead costs as the company aggressively addressed current and expected future economic conditions  the state of end markets served and structural complexities within certain geographies 
the cost of these discrete fourth quarter actions totaled million after tax 
these actions  which include workforce reductions  transfer of work  exiting certain non core activities and the valuation and write off of certain deferred tax assets  are expected to improve the company s cost structure and its manufacturing footprint  and strengthen its global competitive position 
management objectives management is focused on three areas of development employees  processes and strategy which  in combination  are expected to generate long term value for its stockholders 
the company s strategies for growth include both organic growth from new products  services  markets and customers  and growth from acquisitions

liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its overall ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities 
of particular importance in the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditure levels  dividends  capital stock transactions  effective utilization of surplus cash positions overseas and adequate lines of credit 
the company s ability to generate cash from operations in excess of its internal operating needs is one of its financial strengths 
management continues to focus on cash flow and working capital management  and anticipates that operating activities in will generate adequate cash 
in light of current economic events  the company is closely monitoring its cash generation and usage with particular emphasis placed on reducing working capital to generate cash 
management expects lower levels of cash usage in particularly with respect to capital expenditures  rsp payments and debt payments 
management has been very selective when approving capital expenditures and expects discretionary capital spending to be in the range of million in  down from million in participation fee payments related to the rsps were million in  however  no further payments are required as of december  additionally  of the company s long term debt portfolio  only million is due and payable in each of the next two years

operating cash flow may be supplemented with external borrowings to meet near term organic business expansion and the company s current financial commitments 
available credit is closely monitored to ensure debt covenant compliance 
the credit markets are presenting companies with significant challenges in maintaining or expanding credit facilities 
the company has assessed its credit facilities and currently expects that its bank syndicate  comprised of banks  will continue to support these facilities 
at december  the company has million in borrowing availability under its committed credit facilities which mature in september the company believes its credit facilities  coupled with cash generated from operations  are adequate for its anticipated future requirements 
any future acquisitions are expected to be financed through internal cash  borrowings and equity  or a combination thereof 
additionally  we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
cash flow in millions change change operating activities investing activities financing activities exchange rate effect nm increase decrease in cash nm not meaningful operating activities are the principal source of cash flow for the company  generating million in cash during compared to million in the decrease in operating cash flow in was impacted primarily by lower operating performance partially offset by working capital changes 
working capital included higher investments in inventory in at the aerospace aftermarket business of logistics and manufacturing services which were paid for primarily in accounts receivable balances in decreased as a result of lower revenues at businesses throughout each segment

cash from financing activities in included a net increase in borrowings of million compared to million in proceeds in both years were used to partially finance working capital requirements  capital expenditures  rsp payments and dividends 
the proceeds from the sale of the convertible subordinated debt issuance in were used to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
in  the proceeds from borrowings along with cash generated from operating activities were used primarily to fund acquisitions  repay 
table of contents borrowings  and to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures and dividends 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock decreased million to million as a result of lower stock option exercises in the period 
total cash used to pay dividends increased in by million to million due to an increase in the number of shares outstanding and an increase in cash dividends from per share in to per share in during  the company repurchased million shares at an average cost of per share under the terms of its publicly announced repurchase program 
consideration of further repurchases has been deferred until economic conditions improve 
at december   the company held million in cash and cash equivalents  the majority of which are held outside the us in general  the repatriation of this cash to the us would have adverse tax consequences and the balances remain outside the us to fund future international investments 
the company maintains borrowing facilities with banks to supplement internal cash generation 
at december   million was borrowed at an average interest rate of under the company s million borrowing facility which matures in september additionally  the company had million in borrowings under short term bank credit lines at an interest rate of at december  at december   the company s total borrowings are comprised of approximately fixed rate debt and approximately variable rate debt 
the interest payments on approximately of the variable rate interest debt have been converted into payment of fixed interest plus the borrowing spread under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
borrowing capacity is limited by various debt covenants in the company s debt agreements 
the most restrictive borrowing capacity covenant in any agreement requires the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to adjusted earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  as defined in the amended and restated revolving credit agreement  of not more that times at december  and the ratio requirement will decrease to times for fiscal quarters ending after september  following is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda  as defined  to the company s net income in millions net income add back interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization other adjustments adjusted ebitda  as defined consolidated total debt ratio of consolidated total debt to adjusted ebitda other adjustments in primarily relate to the loss from discontinued operations 
the company s level of compliance with such ratio determines the level of additional borrowings available 
additional borrowings of million would have been allowed under the covenants at december   well in excess of the company s unused credit facilities 
the funded status of the company s pension plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets  the level of market interest rates and benefit obligations 
the funded status of the pension plans declined in primarily as a result of the decline in the fair value of the company s pension plan assets due mainly to the losses in the global equity markets 
this decline was partially offset by a decline in the projected benefit obligations of the plans 
the company s other postretirement benefit plans also recorded a decline in the projected benefit obligation in due primarily to a plan amendment 
as a result  the company recorded a million non cash after tax decrease in stockholders equity through other non owner changes to equity to

 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
from a cash perspective  approximately million in cash contributions were made by the company to its various pension plans in including the required minimum contributions to its qualified us pension plans 
the company expects to contribute approximately million to its various plans in contractual obligations and commitments at december   the company had the following contractual obligations and commitments in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations estimated interest payments under long term obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations expected pension contributions expected benefit payments other postretirement benefit plans total interest payments under long term debt obligations have been estimated based on the borrowings outstanding and market interest rates as of december  the amounts do not include purchase obligations already reflected as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the purchase obligation amount includes all outstanding purchase orders as of the balance sheet date as well as the minimum contractual obligation or termination penalty under other contracts 
the amount included in less than year reflects anticipated contributions to the company s various pension plans 
anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable 
the amounts reflect anticipated future benefit payments under the company s various other postretirement benefit plans based on current actuarial assumptions 
expected benefit payments do not extend beyond see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits as the timing of the potential payments of these amounts cannot be determined 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other matters inflation inflation generally affects the company through its costs of labor  equipment and raw materials 
increases in the costs of these items have historically been offset by price increases  operating improvements  and other cost saving initiatives 
the company has periodically experienced inflation in raw material prices 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
loss provisions  if any  on aerospace contracts are established when estimable 
loss provisions are based on the projected excess of manufacturing costs over the net revenues of the products or group of related products under contract 
the process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory often requires the company to 
table of contents make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these provisions 
business acquisitions and goodwill assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
at december   the company had million of goodwill  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or earlier testing if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value 
the assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units  as defined by sfas no 
management completed this annual assessment during the second quarter of based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporated management assumptions about expected future cash flows 
based on this assessment  there was no goodwill impairment in in the fourth quarter of  further analysis was done to ensure that the recent economic downturn had not triggered the need to perform an additional goodwill impairment assessment 
management concluded that a triggering event had not occurred and thus  no further impairment assessment was performed 
future cash flows  and the related fair value of the company s reporting units  can be affected by changes in the global economy and local economies  industries and markets in which the company sells products or services  and the execution of management s plans  including integrating acquired companies
