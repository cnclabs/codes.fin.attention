item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview kimball international  inc provides a variety of products from its two business segments the electronic manufacturing services ems segment and the furniture segment 
the ems segment provides engineering and manufacturing services which utilize common production and support capabilities globally to the medical  automotive  industrial control  and public safety industries 
the furniture segment provides furniture for the office and hospitality industries  sold under the company s family of brand names 
both of the company s segments have been adversely impacted by the weakening in the global economy 
during fiscal year  most of the markets in which the company competes were affected by the global recession and liquidity crisis 
the company experienced declining sales and order trends beginning in its second fiscal quarter 
open orders at june  were lower in the furniture segment and lower in the ems segment when compared to the levels at the end of the company s second fiscal quarter 
the ems industry sales projections for calendar year by idc  isuppli  and electronic trend publications show declines in the range of to 
semiconductor sales  though  are expected to decline approximately in calendar year  and although the company does not directly serve this market  it may indicate a decline in end market demand for products utilizing electronic components 
generally  as electronics end markets decline  ems industry sales improve as customers outsource a greater portion of their electronics manufacturing to free up capital for design and marketing programs and to gain cost advantages 
however  customers could elect to insource a greater portion of their electronics manufacturing during this economic downturn 
the company continues its strategy of diversification within the ems segment customer base as it currently focuses on the four key vertical markets of medical  automotive  industrial control  and public safety 
demand in the automotive market and medical market began to stabilize during the company s fiscal year fourth quarter  but the markets remain uncertain 
the industrial control vertical market is showing signs of stabilization in certain areas  and the public safety vertical market is sending signals of strength 
sales to customers in the medical industry are the largest portion of the company s ems segment with sales to customers in the automotive industry being the second largest 
the company s sales to customers in the automotive industry are diversified among more than ten domestic and foreign customers and represented approximately of the ems segment s net sales for fiscal year the amount of sales of electronic components that relate to general motors  ford  and chrysler automobiles sold in north america were approximately of the company s ems segment net sales during fiscal year the company expects the furniture market to continue to decline or at best flatten out 
the business and institutional furniture manufacturer association bifma international is projecting an approximate year over year decline in the office furniture industry for calendar year while the company expects its mid market brand to fare better than its contract office furniture brand due to the project nature of the contract market  it cannot predict future overall office furniture order trends at this time due to the short lead time of orders and the volatility in the global economy 
the company expects order rates for hospitality furniture to decline further in the near term as hotel occupancy rates and per room revenue rates are declining 
competitive pricing pressures within the ems segment and on many projects within the furniture segment continue to put pressure on the company s operating margins 
the current economic conditions and the tightening of the credit markets have also increased the risk of uncollectible accounts and notes receivables 
accordingly  the company heightened its monitoring of receivables and related credit risks  and the company believes its accounts and notes receivables allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate as of june  given the current market conditions and limited credit availability  the economy could decline further potentially requiring the company to record additional allowances 
the company is continually assessing its strategies in relation to the significant macroeconomic challenges including the instability in the financial markets  credit availability  and demand for products 
a long standing component of the company s profit sharing incentive bonus plan and annual retirement contribution is that they are both linked to the performance of the company which automatically lowers total compensation expense when profits are down 
the company has also implemented various initiatives in response to the deteriorating market conditions including reducing operating costs  more closely scrutinizing customer and supply chain risk  and deferring and cancelling capital expenditures that are not immediately required to support customer requirements 
examples of actions taken during fiscal year to reduce operating costs include a salary reduction plan announced in february  which is expected to save million in labor costs annually  permanent workforce reductions  and temporary personnel layoffs 
in addition  to preserve cash  the dividends declared during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year were reduced approximately from the quarterly dividend rates paid in the first half of the fiscal year which translates to approximately million less cash outflow each time dividends are paid 
the company will continue to closely monitor market changes and its liquidity in order to proactively adjust its operating costs  discretionary capital spending  and dividend levels as needed 
the company continues to have a strong balance sheet which includes a minimal amount of long term debt of million and share owners equity of million 
the company s short term liquidity available  represented as cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments plus the unused amount of the company s revolving credit facility was million at june  in addition to the above risks related to the current economic conditions  management currently considers the following events  trends  and uncertainties to be most important to understanding the company s financial condition and operating performance although the company has seen recent moderate declines in the cost of some commodities and in fuel prices  these continue to be areas of focus within the company 
globalization continues to reshape not only the industries in which the company operates but also its key customers and competitors 
the nature of the electronic manufacturing services industry is such that the start up of new programs to replace departing customers or expiring programs occurs frequently 
the success of the company s ems segment is dependent on the successful replacement of such customers or programs 
such changes usually occur gradually over time as old programs phase out of production while newer programs ramp up 
while the margins vary depending on the size of the program and the vertical market being served  replacement programs often carry lower margins 
successful execution of the company s restructuring plans is critical to the company s future performance 
the success of the restructuring initiatives is dependent on accomplishing the plans in a timely and effective manner 
a critical component of the restructuring initiatives is the transfer of production among facilities which contributed to some manufacturing inefficiencies and excess working capital 
the company s restructuring plans are discussed in the segment discussions below 
the increasingly competitive marketplace mandates that the company continually re evaluate its business models 
the company s employees throughout its business operations are an integral part of the company s ability to compete successfully  and the stability of its management team is critical to long term share owner value 
the company s career development and succession planning process helps to maintain stability in management 
as end markets dictate  the company is continually assessing under utilized capacity and developing plans to grow the company s customer base and better utilize manufacturing operations  including shifting manufacturing capacity to lower cost venues as necessary 
o during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company approved a restructuring plan to consolidate production of select office furniture manufacturing departments 
the consolidation is substantially complete and has reduced manufacturing costs and excess capacity by eliminating redundant property and equipment  processes  and employee costs 
o during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company approved a plan to expand its european automotive electronics capabilities and to establish a european medical center of expertise in poznan  poland 
the company presently has an operation in poznan 
the company successfully completed the move of production from longford  ireland  into the existing poznan facility during the second quarter of fiscal year as part of the plan  the company will also consolidate its ems facilities located in bridgend  wales  and poznan into a new  larger facility in poznan 
o in an effort to improve profitability and increase share owner value while remaining committed to its business model of being market driven and customer centered  during the third quarter of fiscal year  the company approved a restructuring plan designed to more appropriately align its workforce in a changing business environment 
within the company s ems segment  the restructuring activities included realigning engineering and technical resources closer to the customer and streamlining administrative and sales processes 
the furniture segment part of the workforce reduction restructuring activities included realigning information technology and procurement resources closer to the customer and streamlining administrative and sales processes to drive further synergies afforded by the alignment of the sales and manufacturing functions within this segment 
the plan also included reducing corporate personnel costs to more properly align with the overall sales mix change within the company 
this plan is complete 
o in fiscal year  the company completed the consolidation of us manufacturing facilities within the ems segment due to excess capacity resulting in the exit of two facilities that were part of the acquisition of reptron electronics  inc reptron 
to support diversification efforts  the company has focused on both organic growth and acquisition activities 
acquisitions allow rapid diversification of both customers and industries served 
the regulatory and business environment for us public companies requires that the company continually evaluate and enhance its practices in the areas of corporate governance and management practices 
the company has taken a number of steps to conform its corporate governance to evolving national and industry wide best practices among us public companies  not only to comply with new legal requirements  but also to enhance the decision making process of the board of directors 
the preceding statements could be considered forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  a significant change in economic conditions  loss of key customers or suppliers  or similar unforeseen events

the company recorded income from continuing operations for fiscal year of million  or less than per class b diluted share  inclusive of after tax restructuring charges of million  or per class b diluted share 
the fiscal year restructuring charges were primarily related to the european consolidation plan  a workforce reduction plan  and the exit of two domestic ems facilities 
consolidated gross profit as a percent of net sales in fiscal year was compared to in fiscal year both the ems segment and the furniture segment contributed to the decline as discussed in more detail in the segment discussions below 
fiscal year consolidated selling and administrative expenses declined as a percent of net sales and also declined in absolute dollars by as compared to fiscal year the improved selling and administrative expenses were primarily related to benefits realized as a result of the previously announced restructurings  lower salary and wage expense  lower incentive compensation and employee benefit costs which are linked to company profitability  lower depreciation and amortization expense  lower sales and marketing incentive costs  lower travel costs  and other improvements resulting from the focus on managing all costs as a result of the current macroeconomic conditions

additionally  during fiscal years and  the company recorded million and million  respectively  of favorable adjustments due to reductions in its supplemental employee retirement plan serp liability resulting from the normal revaluation of the liability to fair value 
the result for the fiscal year comparison was a favorable variance in selling and administrative costs of million 
the gain resulting from the reduction of the serp liability that was recognized in selling and administrative expenses was exactly offset by a decline in the serp investment which was recorded in other income expense  and thus there was no effect on net earnings 
the serp investment is primarily comprised of employee contributions 
fiscal year other general income included a million pre tax gain on the sale of undeveloped land holdings and timberlands 
the gain on the sale of land was included in unallocated corporate in segment reporting 
also impacting the fiscal year other general income was million pre tax income from earnest money deposits retained by the company resulting from the termination of the contract to sell and lease back the company s poland building and real estate

this income was recorded in the ems segment 
the company recorded non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charges of million during fiscal year as a result of interim goodwill impairment testing which was completed due to the continued uncertainty associated with the economy and the significant decline in the company s sales and order trends as well as the increased disparity between the company s market capitalization and the carrying value of its share owners equity 
the goodwill was related to prior acquisitions in both of the company s segments 
see 
note summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on goodwill 
fiscal year other expense totaled million compared to fiscal year other income of million

fiscal year other income also included million of pre tax income relating to funds received as part of a polish offset credit program for investments made in the company s poland operation 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal year was 
the fiscal year effective tax rate was positively impacted by a tax benefit related to a european subsidiary and to a lesser extent various tax benefits such as tax exempt interest income and the research and development credit which together more than offset the negative impact of losses generated in select foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the domestic rate 
as a result of various tax benefits in fiscal year  such as tax exempt interest income and the research and development credit  coupled with the tax benefit recorded related to the pre tax loss  the company recorded an overall income tax benefit greater than the pre tax loss in fiscal year for further detail see 
note income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 
comparing the balance sheets as of june  to june   the company s combined cash and short term investments balances increased primarily due to cash inflows related to reductions in the company s accounts receivable and inventory balances and the sale of the company s undeveloped land holdings and timberlands 
the company s accounts receivable balance declined primarily as a result of the lower sales volumes  and the inventory balance declined due to the lower sales volumes and a focus on managing working capital during the latter half of fiscal year the company s accounts payable balance also decreased since june  in relation to the declining inventory balances 
the increase in property and equipment was primarily due to the construction of the new ems segment facility in poland and the purchase of other ems segment manufacturing equipment 
the other assets line declined due to the sale of the tracts of undeveloped land holdings and timberlands  cash proceeds received from this sale increased the company s cash balance and allowed the company to reduce borrowings under its credit facilities 
accrued expenses as of june  declined when compared to june  primarily due to decreased accruals for employee benefits which are linked to company profitability  lower accrued selling expenses  lower accrued restructuring expenses  and a decline in the deferred income balance due to recognition of various items during fiscal year the variance in the additional paid in capital and treasury stock lines was primarily attributable to the fulfillment of requests by share owners to convert approximately  shares from class a shares to class b shares and the issuance of vested restricted share units to key employees 
the decline in accumulated other comprehensive income loss was related to foreign currency translation adjustments and derivative financial instruments

new customer and program start ups generally cause losses early in the life of a program  which are generally recovered as the program matures and becomes established 
this segment continues to experience margin pressures related to an overall excess capacity position in the electronics subcontracting services market 
risk factors within this segment include  but are not limited to  general economic and market conditions  customer order delays  increased globalization  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  rapid technological changes  component availability  the contract nature of this industry  unexpected integration issues with acquisitions  the importance of sales to large customers  and the potential for customers to choose to insource a greater portion of their electronics manufacturing

however  for clarity purposes  the company does separately disclose the adjustment to net income for the loss on disposal of discontinued operations in cash flows from operating activities and the proceeds from disposal of discontinued operations in cash flows from investing activities 
the following discussions are based on income from continuing operations and therefore exclude all income statement activity of the discontinued operations 
financial overview consolidated fiscal year consolidated net sales were billion compared to fiscal year net sales of billion  a increase over fiscal year the higher net sales resulted from increased ems segment net sales related to the third quarter fiscal year reptron acquisition within the ems segment which contributed net sales of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year as well as increased organic furniture and ems segment net sales 
in addition  in mid fiscal year  the company reduced the price of finished product sold to a customer in the ems segment which carried forward through fiscal year fiscal year had a full year impact of this pricing reduction while fiscal year only had the impact for half of the year and thus resulted in a million net sales reduction in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year  which partially offset the ems sales increase 
the company recorded income from continuing operations for fiscal year of million  or less than per class b diluted share  inclusive of after tax restructuring charges of million  or per class b diluted share 
the fiscal year restructuring charges were primarily related to the european consolidation plan  a workforce reduction plan  and the exit of two domestic ems facilities

gross profit was also negatively impacted as the company s sales mix continued to shift toward the ems segment  which operates at a lower gross profit percentage than the furniture segment 
partially offsetting the fiscal year gross profit as a percent of net sales decline  the ems customer pricing adjustment discussed above increased gross margin as a percent of net sales approximately percentage point compared to fiscal year gross margin 
this ems customer pricing adjustment had no impact on the gross margin dollars for either fiscal year or fiscal year as the reduction in sales was offset by an equal reduction in material cost purchased from the same customer 
the fiscal year consolidated selling and administrative expense level in absolute dollars approximated the fiscal year level and declined as a percent of net sales 
the decline in consolidated selling and administrative costs as a percent of net sales was primarily due to the leverage of the higher net sales level and the shift in sales mix toward the ems segment  which has a lower selling and administrative expense percentage than the furniture segment 
fiscal year other income totaled million compared to fiscal year other income of million 
fiscal year interest expense was million higher due to higher average outstanding debt balances  and fiscal year interest income was million lower than fiscal year as the company s average cash and short term investment balances were lower 
in addition  a million decline in the market value of the company s serp investments for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year contributed to the decline in other income 
the loss on the serp investment that was recognized in other income was exactly offset by a reduction in the serp liability which was recognized in selling and administrative expense in accordance with us gaap 
fiscal year other income also included million pre tax income relating to funds received as part of a polish offset credit program for investments made in the company s poland operation 
as a result of various tax benefits in fiscal year  such as tax exempt interest income and the research and development credit  coupled with the tax benefit recorded related to the pre tax loss  the company recorded an overall income tax benefit greater than the pre tax loss

ems segment fiscal year income from continuing operations totaled million  inclusive of after tax restructuring charges of million 
fiscal year gross profit as a percent of net sales declined percentage points compared to fiscal year fiscal year gross profit was negatively impacted by excess capacity costs and inefficiencies some of which were associated with the closure of two domestic facilities and the related transfer of production to other facilities within this segment 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by a shift in product mix to lower margin product 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year  gross profit as a percent of sales was favorably impacted by a reduction in the pricing of select raw material which is purchased from bayer ag and affiliates  a major customer within the ems segment 
the selling price of the finished product back to bayer ag and affiliates was likewise reduced by an amount equal to the material price reduction 
while there was no impact to gross profit dollars  net income  or net cash flows related to this pricing change  gross profit as a percent of net sales increased approximately percentage point  and selling and administrative expense as a percent of net sales increased by a similar percentage for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year fiscal year selling and administrative expense increased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales when compared to fiscal year the inclusion of the selling and administrative expenses of the mid third quarter fiscal year acquisition for the entire fiscal year was the primary driver of the increase in selling and administrative expense in absolute dollars 
the customer pricing adjustment mentioned above increased selling and administrative expense as a percent of net sales  and the leverage of higher sales volume decreased selling and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 
in addition  increased investments in business development resources contributed to the selling and administrative expense increase as a percent of net sales and in absolute dollars

annually  or if conditions indicate an earlier review is necessary  the company compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to an estimate of the reporting unit s fair value to identify potential impairment 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to determine the amount of potential goodwill impairment 
if impaired  goodwill is written down to its estimated implied fair value 
goodwill is assigned to and the fair value is tested at the reporting unit level 
the company uses discounted cash flows to establish its reporting unit fair values 
the calculation of the fair value of the reporting units considers current market conditions existing at the assessment date 
during fiscal year  goodwill was reviewed on an interim basis due to the continued uncertainty associated with the economy and the significant decline in the company s sales and order trends as well as the increased disparity between the company s market capitalization and the carrying value of its share owners equity 
interim testing resulted in the recognition of non cash pre tax goodwill impairment of  in millions  within the ems segment and within the furniture segment 
in addition to performing the required annual testing  the company will continue to monitor circumstances and events in future periods to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is warranted on an interim basis 
the company can provide no assurance that an additional impairment charge for the company s remaining goodwill balance will not occur in future periods as a result of these analyses 
at june  and june   the company s goodwill totaled  in millions  and  respectively
