item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing in item of this form k 
company overview we believe we are among the leading suppliers of high performance materials  materials packaging and materials delivery systems used worldwide in the manufacture of microelectronics devices 
our products consist of front end semiconductor performance materials  sub atmospheric pressure gas delivery systems for safe handling and delivery of toxic and hazardous gases to semiconductor process equipment  high purity materials packaging and dispensing systems that allow for the reliable introduction of low volatility liquids and solids to microelectronics and biopharmaceutical processes 
atmi targets both semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers  whose products form the foundation of microelectronics technology rapidly proliferating through the consumer products  information technology  automotive  and communications industries 
the market for microelectronics devices has historically grown and is continually changing  which drives demand for new products and technologies at lower cost 
atmi s objective is to meet the demands of microelectronics manufacturers with solutions that maximize the efficiency of their manufacturing processes  reduce capital costs  and minimize the time to ramp new processes and deliver new products 
atmi s customers include many of the leading semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers in the world who target leading edge technologies 
atmi also addresses an increasing number of critical materials handling needs for the life sciences markets 
our proprietary containment  mixing  and bioreactor technologies are sold to the biotechnology and laboratory markets  which we believe offer significant growth potential 
critical accounting policies and estimates general preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates 
these policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by atmi s audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from product sales are generally recognized upon delivery to a common carrier when terms are equivalent to free on board fob origin and upon receipt by a customer when terms are equivalent to fob destination 
in instances where final acceptance of equipment is specified by the purchase agreement  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been satisfied 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we accrue for sales returns  warranty costs  and other allowances based on a current evaluation of our experience based on stated terms of the transactions 
should actual product failure rates or customer return experience differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated accruals would be required 

table of contents the company uses an exclusive contract manufacturer  which is also an exclusive distribution partner  for the manufacture and distribution of its sds products the licensed products 
under the terms of the manufacturing agreement  atmi retains the right to manufacture percent of all licensed products  while the contract manufacturer has the right to manufacture percent of all licensed products 
upon completion of manufacture  atmi purchases all licensed products produced by the contract manufacturer 
under the terms of the distribution agreement  we receive payment from the distributor based upon a formula which is dependent on the sale price obtained by the distributor to its customer 
atmi recognizes revenue from the sale of licensed products to this distribution partner when the distributor sells the licensed products to its customers  because that is when the sales price becomes fixed and determinable by the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to represent our best estimate of the net realizable value of the outstanding accounts receivable balances 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on past due amounts and historical write off experience  as well as trends and factors surrounding the credit risk of the markets we operate in and the financial viability of specific customers 
in an effort to identify adverse trends  we assess the financial health of the markets we operate in and perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and ongoing reviews of account balances and agings of receivables 
amounts are considered past due when payment has not been received within the time frame of the credit terms extended 
write offs are charged directly against the allowance for doubtful accounts and occur only after all collection efforts have been exhausted 
actual write offs and adjustments could differ from the allowance estimates because of unanticipated changes in the business environment as well as factors and risks surrounding specific customers 
inventory valuation reserves inventory valuation reserves are established in order to report inventories at the lower of cost or market value on our consolidated balance sheets 
the determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories 
valuation reserves for excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory where the resale value or replacement value is less than inventory cost 
other factors that management considers in determining these reserves include whether individual inventory parts or chemicals meet current specifications and cannot be substituted for or reworked into a part currently being sold or used as a service part  overall market conditions  and other inventory management initiatives 
as of december  and we had million and million  respectively  of inventory valuation reserves recorded 
although management believes these reserves are adequate  any abrupt adverse changes in market conditions may require us to record additional inventory valuation reserves 
non marketable equity securities we selectively invest in non marketable equity securities of private companies  which range from early stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies whose products or technologies may directly support an atmi product or initiative 
at december   the carrying value of our portfolio of strategic investments in non marketable equity securities totaled million million in 
non marketable equity securities are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption other long term assets 
investments in non marketable equity securities are inherently risky  and some of these companies are likely to fail 
their success or lack thereof is dependent on product development  market acceptance  operational efficiency  attracting and retaining talented professionals  and other key business success factors 
in addition  depending on their future prospects  they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations  with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings  and the investments would likely become impaired 

table of contents we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment  however  for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis may require significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include a the investee s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects  b the technological feasibility of the investee s products and technologies  c the general market conditions in the investee s industry or geographic area  including adverse regulatory or economic changes  d factors related to the investee s ability to remain in business  such as the investee s liquidity  and the rate at which the investee is using its cash  and e the investee s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation 
investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its fair value  using the framework established by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view  we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise 
we recognized a million impairment in our portfolio of non marketable equity securities in none in and million in 
income taxes the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is million at december  and million at december  we believe that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is provided 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period in which that determination is made 
with the january  adoption of sfas no 
revised  business combinations  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances recorded in a business combination and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
for a discussion of current tax matters  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment atmi s net property  plant and equipment at december  and was million and million  respectively  representing percent and percent  respectively  of the company s consolidated total assets 
depreciation expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation 

table of contents property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets useful lives on a straight line basis for financial reporting purposes 
the estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the company and is determined by management based on many factors  including historical experience with similar assets and technological life cycles 
circumstances and events relating to these assets are monitored to ensure that changes in assets lives or impairments are identified and prospective depreciation expense or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly 
the depreciation periods used are buildings  to years  machinery and equipment  to years  cylinders and canisters  to years  furniture and fixtures  years  and leasehold improvements  over the lesser of the lease term or estimated useful life 
we use accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate 
equity based compensation the company uses the black scholes merton options pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options under sfas no 
r  share based payment 
management is required to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs  including anticipated changes in the underlying stock price ie  expected volatility and option exercise activity ie  expected term 
for awards granted subsequent to january   expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of atmi common stock for a period shorter than the expected term of the options 
we have excluded the historical volatility prior to the public announcement regarding the sale of our non core businesses in  because those businesses that were sold represented a significant portion of atmi s consolidated business and were subject to considerable cyclicality associated with the semiconductor equipment industry  which drove increased volatility in atmi s stock price 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected term 
we recognize expense only for those awards expected to vest 
if factors change and result in different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the stock option expense that the company records for future grants may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 
equity based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated service period of the awards 
fair value measurements we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements on january   with the exception of the application of the statement to nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  the deferral of which was permitted under fsp all of our financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value based upon level or level inputs  as defined under sfas no 
 with the exception of one auction rate security  which has been measured using level inputs  because the security is illiquid 
for level measurements  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
for level measurements  we use observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities  quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets  or model derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
for level measurements  we use unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities 
as of december  we have recorded a temporary impairment charge of million within the caption accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets based upon an independent third party valuation we received for this auction rate security 
the valuation of this security incorporated assumptions about the anticipated term and the yield that a market participant would require to purchase such a security in the current market environment 
while we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate  the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies can have a material impact on the values of the related assets  our financial position  and overall liquidity 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition 
goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment testing 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in the global economy and local economies  changes in the microelectronics industry  changes in technology  and the execution of management s plans 
although no goodwill impairment has been recorded to date  there can be no assurances that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
other long lived amortizable assets we evaluate the potential impairment of other long lived assets when appropriate 
if the carrying value of assets exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows  the carrying value of the asset is written down to fair value 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements 
related party transactions the company s related parties are primarily unconsolidated equity affiliates

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview during the year ended december   atmi s revenues declined by percent compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the global economic downturn  which began in earnest in the second half of and drove significant declines in demand across almost all segments of the economy 
future reductions in wafer starts in the microelectronics industry  including foundries  and other logic and memory chip manufacturers  are expected to continue to adversely affect the company s near term results 
our gross margin declined by basis points to percent in compared to percent in  due to lower revenue volumes  increased costs reflected in cost of revenues as a result of the redirection of certain supply chain and operations activities associated with our organizational changes  which was effective beginning january  such costs were previously reflected in selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a  and higher logistics costs due to fuel surcharges in the first half of the year 
the realignment of operations activities caused gross margin and sg a to decline by approximately basis points in compared to these activities include those functions in two of our locations that were previously focused on supporting and administering plant operations  whereas in the current organization those activities have been focused on improving our global supply chain and customer satisfaction 
research and development expenses r d increased percent to million in from million in the increase was driven primarily by the continued investment in our global high productivity development activities 
sg a decreased by percent in from as a percent of revenues  sg a decreased to percent in compared to percent in the decrease is primarily because of the organizational realignment discussed above  and reductions in discretionary spending as a result of the global economic downturn 
operating income decreased percent in to million  primarily due to the decline in revenues

table of contents revenues 
revenues decreased percent to million in from million in the decline in revenues occurred in our microelectronics product lines and was primarily the result of the global economic downturn  which resulted in significant reductions in wafer starts and reductions in fab utilization rates as demand for consumer electronics devices has slowed 
revenues in our microelectronics product lines declined percent to million in compared to million in the primary driver of the reduction in revenues was wafer starts  which began to significantly decline during the last several months of the decline in our revenues was further magnified by reductions of inventory in the sds and flat panel display distribution channels  as well as our customers aggressive management of their inventories 
consumer electronics spending  the primary driver of wafer start growth  has declined dramatically since the end of the previous year  and it s difficult to predict when this demand trend will improve 
the revenues include a million benefit associated with settlement of a dispute with our manufacturing and distribution partner for sds products 
reductions in average selling prices of our products accounted for approximately percent of the decline in microelectronics revenues 
revenues in our life sciences product lines increased percent in to million compared to million in more than half of the increase in life sciences revenues came from the levtech  which we acquired in january  with the remaining increase being driven by new products  as disposable mixing solutions gained traction in the biopharmaceutical markets  and limited pricing increases 
the effect of foreign currency was not significant in as declines associated with weakness in the korean won were offset by strengthening in the japanese yen and the euro 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased percent to million in from million in our gross margin percentage decreased during this time period from percent in to percent in approximately basis points of the gross margin decline is a result of the redirection of certain supply chain and operations activities discussed above 
gross profit in our microelectronics product lines decreased percent to million in from million in gross profit margins in our microelectronics product lines were approximately percent in both and the gross profit margins included benefits from the distributor settlement approximately basis points and the business interruption claim recovery approximately basis points  both mentioned above 
gross profit margins were unfavorably impacted by the volume and average selling price declines discussed above and higher logistics costs due to fuel surcharges in the first half of the gross profit margins in our microelectronics product lines were negatively impacted by lower shipment volumes in our materials packaging product lines due to flat panel display market softness in the first half of  million of increased customs expenses on imported goods from the us to an overseas subsidiary  and also due to the consequences of a manufacturing defect  which was since remedied 
gross profit in our life sciences product lines increased percent to million in compared to million in gross profit margins in our life sciences product lines declined by over basis points from percent in to percent in the primary reasons for the decline in gross profit margins in the life sciences product lines were the realignment of certain supply chain and operations activities discussed above negative impact of approximately basis points  partially offset by average selling price increases for certain products favorable impact of approximately basis points and the benefit from the levtech acquisition approximately basis points 
research and development expenses 
r d increased percent to million in from million in the increase in r d spending was primarily caused by planned increases in spending associated with high productivity development activities related to cleans chemistries including million of higher licensing and outsourced development costs  million of higher staffing related expenses and million of higher equipment depreciation costs 
as a percentage of revenues  r d spending was percent in compared to percent in the spending in was higher as a percent of revenues than we had planned  primarily because revenues were lower than expected for the reasons noted above 
we plan to continue to actively invest in our high productivity development capabilities in the foreseeable future  because we believe this investment will drive significant new opportunities in cleans chemistries and other new products and will be a competitive advantage for atmi

operating income 
operating income decreased percent to million in  or percent of revenues  from million in  or percent of revenues 
these changes are from a variety of factors  as noted above 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in from million in the primary reasons for the decrease were lower invested cash and marketable securities balances as a result of the company s share repurchase program  the acquisition of levtech  capital spending and other strategic investments  and lower rates of return given the significant reduction in market interest rates in impairment of investments

prior to the acquistion  atmi s cost basis investment in semequip was million 
atmi received million representing its share of the closing proceeds 
as a result  we wrote off the remaining million balance from our investment in semequip due to the uncertainty of collecting amounts in the future related to the earnout provisions of the deal 
also in  due to changes in events and circumstances related to a convertible note due from an early stage semiconductor materials venture that is in bankruptcy  we recognized an impairment charge of million to fully write down the value of this convertible note 
other income expense  net

revenues increased percent to million in from million in this increase was broad based across our product portfolio 
revenues from our microelectronics product lines increased percent from million in to million in during this period of time  independent market research estimated wafer start growth at percent depending on the source of the research 
our revenues grew faster than the industry average given our focus on copper materials  which are needed for the new advanced technology nodes which represent smaller chip sizes 
wafer starts in advanced technology nodes grow faster than older technologies because our customers invest in new technologies to meet the increasing performance requirements of new consumer electronic products 
the growth in wafer starts was driven primarily by the growth in the global consumer electronics market during the period 
revenues from our life sciences product lines increased percent from million to million 
approximately one half of this growth was driven by new product revenues and one half was driven by growth in the biopharmaceutical market 
pricing changes did not have a material impact on revenues during the period

table of contents research and development expenses 
r d increased percent to million in from million in the increase in r d spending was primarily attributable to collaborative research activities with a strategic investment partner related to cleans chemistries and the development of new products such as regensi  autoclean  and cmplicity

sg a  as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly to percent in compared to percent in despite a million reduction in equity based compensation expense from true ups associated with forfeitures and resulting changes in the forfeiture rate estimates for future periods  sg a grew by million in compared to primarily because of increased employee related costs  as salaries increased million and benefits increased million 
other cost increases included consultants and professional services of million  depreciation on facilities of million  and legal fees of million 
operating income 
operating income increased percent to million in  or percent of revenues  from million in  or percent of revenues 
these changes are from a variety of factors  as noted above 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily from lower invested cash and marketable securities balances resulting from cash used to repurchase shares of the company s common stock and a shift to lower yielding tax exempt securities 
provision for income taxes 
in  we reduced our income tax provision by million  by reversing previously established reserves  as a result of the lapse of the applicable statute of limitations 
aside from the tax adjustment mentioned above  the primary driver for the increase in the provision for income taxes in versus was the increase in income 
the effective tax rate for was percent compared to an effective tax rate of percent in the effective tax rate of percent differs from the federal statutory rate of percent primarily due to foreign income taxes and tax exempt income  partially offset by state income taxes 
the effective tax rate of percent differs from the federal statutory rate of percent primarily due to the recognition of million in tax benefits which represents approximately basis points  foreign income taxes  tax exempt income  extra territorial income eti exclusion benefits  partially offset by state income taxes 
as of december   the company had a net deferred tax asset of million  primarily from temporary differences book versus tax  state tax credit carry forwards  and state net operating loss carry forwards 
liquidity and capital resources we assess liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating and investing activities 
of particular importance to the management of liquidity are cash flows generated by operating activities  cash used for capital expenditures  cash used to repurchase common stock  and cash obtained through lines of credit 
until required for use in the business  we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits  certificates of deposit  money market securities  government and government sponsored bond obligations  and other interest bearing marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy 
the value of these securities may be adversely affected which could impact our financial position and our overall liquidity 
in particular  the value of our investments may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates  instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio  and by other factors which may result in other than temporary declines in value of the investments 
each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost 
we attempt to mitigate these risks with the assistance of our investment advisors by investing in high quality securities and continuously monitoring the overall risk profile of our portfolio 
we also maintain a well diversified portfolio that limits our credit exposure through concentration limits set within our investment policy 

table of contents we have financed our operating needs  capital expenditures  and share buyback through cash flows from our operations  lines of credit  and existing cash 
we expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through cash from operations  as well as existing cash resources 
we believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may  from time to time  seek additional funding through a combination of additional equity and debt financings or from other sources 
due to the current state of the credit markets  we are not able to predict with any certainty whether we could obtain debt or equity financing to provide additional sources of liquidity  should the need arise  at favorable rates or at all 
we continue to invest in r d to provide future sources of revenue through the development of new products  as well as through additional uses for existing products 
we consider r d and the development of new products and technologies an integral part of our growth strategy and a core competency of the company 
likewise  we continue to make capital expenditures in order to expand and modernize manufacturing facilities around the globe and to drive efficiencies throughout the organization 
additionally  management considers  on a continuing basis  potential acquisitions of strategic technologies and businesses complementary to the company s current business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   the company s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities included bank deposits  certificates of deposit  money market securities  government and government sponsored bond obligations 
as of december   an increase of basis points in interest rates on securities with maturities greater than one year would reduce the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
conversely  a reduction of basis points in interest rates on securities with maturities greater than one year would increase the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk most of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars and as a result  the company doesn t have any significant exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
approximately percent of the company s revenues for the year ended december  were denominated in japanese yen jpy  korean won  and euros  but a majority of the product is sourced in us dollars 
management periodically reviews the company s exposure to currency fluctuations 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material effect on the company s financial results in the future 
we use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge specific exposures relating to intercompany payments and anticipated  but not yet committed  intercompany sales primarily parent company export sales to subsidiaries at pre established us dollar prices 
the terms of the forward foreign exchange contracts are generally matched to the underlying transaction being hedged  and are typically under one year 
because such contracts are directly associated with identified transactions  they are an effective hedge against fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency underlying the transaction 
we recognize in earnings other income expense  net changes in the fair value of all derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments that are highly effective and recognize in accumulated other comprehensive income any changes in the fair value of all derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments that are highly effective and meet the other related accounting requirements 
we generally do not hedge overseas sales denominated in foreign currencies or translation exposures 
further  we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all of our derivatives were highly effective throughout the periods reported 
at december   we held forward foreign currency exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling million  which are being used to hedge recorded foreign denominated liabilities and which will be settled in jpy 
holding other variables constant  if there were a percent decline in foreign exchange rates for the jpy  the fair market value of the jpy contracts outstanding at december  would decrease by approximately million  which would be expected to be fully offset by foreign exchange gains on the amounts being hedged 
the effect of an immediate percent change in other foreign exchange rates would not be expected to have a material effect on the company s future operating results or cash flows 

table of contents changes in market risk global credit and financial markets have been experiencing extreme disruptions in recent months  including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  declines in consumer confidence  declines in economic growth  increases in unemployment rates  and uncertainty about economic stability 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions 
these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways  making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities 
the current tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending  which may cause our customers to delay their future orders with us 
in addition  financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays  increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions  and if the current uncertain economic conditions continue or further deteriorate  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected
