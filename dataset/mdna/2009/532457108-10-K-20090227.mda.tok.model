item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition review of operations executive overview this section provides an overview of our financial results  recent product and late stage pipeline developments  significant business development  and legal  regulatory  and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry 
financial results we achieved worldwide sales growth of percent  which was primarily driven by volume increases in several key products 
the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on cost of sales contributed to an improvement in gross margin 
marketing  selling  and administrative expenses grew at the same rate as sales  driven by pre launch activities associated with prasugrel  marketing costs associated with cymbalta and evista  the impact of foreign exchange rates  and increased litigation related expenses  while our investment in research and development grew percent 
we completed our acquisition of imclone systems inc imclone  resulting in a significant charge of billion for acquired in process research and development ipr d and reached resolution on government investigations related to our past us marketing and promotional practices for zyprexa  resulting in an additional charge of billion 
we incurred tax expense of million  despite a loss before income taxes of billion  primarily caused by the non deductibility of the imclone ipr d charge and the partial deductibility of the zyprexa investigation settlements 
accordingly  earnings decreased billion  to a net loss of billion  and earnings per share decreased  to a loss of per share  in as compared with net income of billion  or earnings per share of in net income comparisons between and are affected by the impact of the following significant items see notes    and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information acquisitions note we recognized charges totaling billion pretax associated with the acquisition of imclone  which decreased earnings per share by 
these amounts include an ipr d charge of billion pretax 
the remaining net expenses are related to imclone s operating results subsequent to the acquisition  incremental interest costs  and amortization of the intangible asset associated with erbitux 
we also incurred ipr d charges of million pretax associated with the acquisition of sgx pharmaceuticals  inc sgx  which decreased earnings per share by 
we incurred ipr d charges associated with licensing arrangements with bioms medical corp 
bioms and transpharma medical ltd 
totaling million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
chart asset impairments and related restructuring and other special charges notes and we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges totaling million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
a similar charge of million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by  was included in cost of sales 
these charges were primarily associated with the sale of our greenfield  indiana site  the termination of the air insulin program  and strategic exit activities related to manufacturing operations 
we recorded charges of billion pretax related to the federal and state zyprexa investigations led by the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania edpa  as well as the resolution of a multi state investigation regarding zyprexa involving states and the district of columbia  which decreased earnings per share by 
other note we recognized a discrete income tax benefit of million as a result of the resolution of a substantial portion of the irs audit of our federal income tax returns for the years through  which increased earnings per share by 
acquisitions note we incurred ipr d charges associated with the acquisitions of icos corporation icos  hypnion  inc hypnion  and ivy animal health  inc ivy  totaling million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
we incurred ipr d charges associated with our licensing arrangements with glenmark pharmaceuticals limited india  macrogenics  inc  and osi pharmaceuticals  totaling million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
asset impairments and related restructuring and other special charges notes and we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
these charges were primarily associated with previously announced strategic decisions affecting manufacturing and research facilities 
we incurred a special charge following a settlement with one of our insurance carriers over zyprexa product liability claims  which led to a reduction of our expected product liability insurance recoveries  and other product liability charges 
this resulted in a charge totaling million pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
late stage pipeline developments and business development activity our long term success depends  to a great extent  on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotech nology or pharmaceutical companies 
there were a number of late stage pipeline developments and business development transactions within the past year  including pipeline we  along with our partner daiichi sankyo company limited  are seeking from the us food and drug administration fda approval for prasugrel as a treatment for patients with acute coronary syndrome being managed with percutaneous coronary intervention 
the cardiovascular and renal drugs advisory committee of the fda reviewed prasugrel during a hearing and unanimously recommended it for approval 
the fda will consider the recommendation as it continues its review and makes its final decision 
prasugrel was approved for marketing by the european commission under the trade name efient in february for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention 
we received a complete response letter from the fda for olanzapine long acting injection lai for acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults 
we are continuing to work with the agency on the new drug application nda 
the fda does not require any additional clinical trials for the continued review of the nda 
per the agency s request  we are preparing a proposed risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  which will be submitted in the near future 
in addition  olanzapine long acting injection was approved by the european commission under the trade name zypadhera tm 
we withdrew our supplemental nda from the fda for cymbalta for the management of chronic pain 
we plan to resubmit the application in the first half of  adding data from a recently completed study in chronic osteoarthritis pain of the knee 
the fda approved alimta  in combination with cisplatin  as a first line treatment for locally advanced and metastatic non small cell lung cancer nsclc for patients with nonsquamous histology 
the european health authorities also approved alimta  in combination with cisplatin  as a first line treatment for non small cell lung cancer patients with other than predominantly squamous cell histology 
we submitted tadalafil as a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension pah to regulatory authorities in the us  europe  and japan 
the fda approved cymbalta for the management of fibromyalgia  a chronic pain disorder 
in addition  the european commission approved cymbalta for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder gad 
we  along with our partner amylin pharmaceuticals  inc amylin  submitted byetta as a monotherapy treatment for type diabetes to the fda 
the european commission approved a new indication for forsteo for the treatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained  systemic glucocorticoid therapy in women and men at increased risk for fracture 
we have also received an approvable letter from the fda for forteo for the same indication 
we terminated development of our air insulin program  which was being conducted in collaboration with alkermes  inc the program had been in phase iii clinical development as a potential treatment for type and type diabetes 
this decision was not a result of any observations during air insulin trials relating to the safety of the product  but rather was a result of increasing uncertainties in the regulatory environment and a thorough evaluation of the evolving commercial and clinical potential of the product compared to existing medical therapies 
business development we acquired all of the outstanding shares of imclone for a total purchase price of approximately billion 
this strategic combination will offer both targeted therapies and oncolytic agents along with an oncology pipeline spanning all phases of clinical development 
it also expands our biotechnology capabilities 
we entered into a license and a supply arrangement with united therapeutics corporation related to the us commercialization rights for the pah indication of tadalafil 
we received an upfront payment of million in exchange for exclusive rights to commercialize tadalafil for pah in the us  as well as for a product manufacturing and supply arrangement 
as part of this arrangement  we acquired a million equity position in the company 
the indication is currently under review by the fda 
we acquired the worldwide rights to the dairy cow supplement posilac  as well as the product s supporting operations  from monsanto company monsanto for an upfront payment of million  as well as contingent consideration based on future posilac sales 
the acquisition of posilac provides us with a product that complements those of our animal health product line 
we sold our greenfield laboratories site in greenfield  indiana  to covance inc we also signed a year service agreement  under which covance will assume responsibility for our toxicology testing and other r d support activities at the site 
we acquired sgx for approximately million in cash 
the acquisition allows us to integrate sgx s structure guided drug discovery platform into our drug discovery efforts 
it also gives us access to fast tm  sgx s fragment based  protein structure guided drug discovery technology  and to a portfolio of preclinical oncology compounds focused on a number of kinase targets 
we entered into a licensing and development agreement with transpharma medical ltd 
transpharma to acquire rights to its product and related drug delivery system for the treatment of osteoporosis 
the product  which is administered transdermally using transpharma s proprietary technology  is currently in phase ii clinical testing 
we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of tpg axon capital tpg for the phase iii development of our two lead molecules for the treatment of alzheimer s disease 
this agreement provides tpg with success based milestones and royalties in exchange for clinical trial funding 
we entered into a licensing and development agreement with bioms whereby we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to a multiple sclerosis ms compound 
the compound is currently being evaluated in two pivotal phase iii clinical trials in secondary progressive ms 
legal  regulatory  and other matters in march  we were notified by the us attorney s office for the edpa that it had commenced an investigation relating to our us marketing and promotional practices for zyprexa  prozac  and prozac weekly tm 
in october  we announced that we were in advanced discussions to resolve the ongoing investigations led by the edpa  and we recorded a charge of billion 
in january  we announced that the discussions had been successfully concluded  and that we settled the zyprexa related federal claims  as well as similar medicaid related claims of states which decide to participate in the settlement 
beginning in august  we received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states under various state consumer protection laws seeking documents pertaining to zyprexa 
in october  we reached a settlement with states and the district of columbia  under which we paid million 
in december  the federal supreme court bgh in germany re established our zyprexa patent that had been declared invalid in by the german federal patent court 
as a result of this ruling  generic olanzapine has been withdrawn from the german market as of the beginning of we continue to reach agreements with claimants attorneys involved in us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle claims against us relating to the medication 
approximately claims remain 
in the third quarter of  we initiated a strategic review of our tippecanoe manufacturing facility in lafayette  indiana 
options being considered for this site include continuing operations with a revised site mission  exploring opportunities to sell the facility  and ceasing operations altogether 
the review is expected to last six to twelve months 
no final decisions have been made at this time  however  depending on the decision  we could record significant charges 
in the united states  the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of mma continues to provide an effective prescription drug benefit under the medicare program known as medicare part d 
various measures have been discussed and or passed in both the us house of representatives and us senate that would impose additional pricing pressures on our products  including proposals to legalize the importation of prescription drugs and either allow  or require  the secretary of health and human services to negotiate drug prices within medicare part d directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
additionally  various proposals have been introduced that would increase the rebates we pay on sales to medicaid patients or impose additional rebates on sales to patients who receive their medicines through medicare part d 
uncertainty exists surrounding the new administration and congress and the impact any government decisions or programs will have on the pharmaceutical industry 
in addition  many states are facing substantial budget difficulties due to the downturn in the economy and are expected to seek aggressive cuts or other offsets in healthcare spending 
we expect pricing pressures at the federal and state levels to become more severe  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations  and there are many proposals for additional cost containment measures  including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection

gross margin  costs  and expenses the gross margin decreased to percent of sales compared with percent for this decrease was primarily due to the expense resulting from the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the icos acquisition  the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates  and production volumes growing at a slower rate than sales  offset partially by manufacturing expenses growing at a slower rate than sales 
operating expenses the aggregate of research and development and marketing  selling  and administrative expenses increased percent in investment in research and development increased percent  to billion 
in addition to the acquisition of icos  this increase was due to increases in discovery research and late stage clinical trial costs

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
financial condition as of december   cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled billion compared with billion at december  cash flow from operations in of billion and net proceeds from the issuance of debt of billion exceeded the total of the net cash paid for corporate acquisitions of billion  dividends paid of billion  purchases of property and equipment of million  and net purchases of noncurrent investments of million 
capital expenditures of million during were million less than in we expect capital expenditures to be approximately billion as we invest in our biotechnology capabilities  continue to upgrade our manufacturing and research facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems  and invest in the long term growth of our diabetes care products 
chart total debt as of december  increased billion  to billion  reflecting the commercial paper we issued in november primarily to finance our acquisition of imclone  offset by long term debt repayments and paydown of commercial paper with cash and cash equivalents on hand 
our current debt ratings from standard poor s and moody s are at aa and a  respectively 
dividends of per share were paid in  an increase of percent from in the fourth quarter of  effective for the first quarter dividend in  the quarterly dividend was increased to 
per share a percent increase  resulting in an indicated annual rate for of per share 
the year was the th consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the st consecutive year in which dividends have been increased 
chart in recent months  global economic conditions have deteriorated 
triggered by the liquidity crisis in the capital markets  the implications have become more widespread  resulting in higher unemployment and declines in real consumer spending 
in addition  many financial institutions have tightened lines of credit  reducing funding available for near term economic growth 
pharmaceutical consumption has traditionally been relatively unaffected by economic downturns  however  an extended downturn could lead to a decline in overall prescriptions corresponding with the growth of the uninsured and underinsured population in the us in addition  both private and public health care payers are facing heightened fiscal challenges due to the economic slowdown and are taking aggressive steps to reduce the costs of care  including pressures for increased pharmaceutical discounts and rebates and efforts to drive greater use of generic drugs 
we continue to monitor the potential near term impact of prescription trends  the credit worthiness of our wholesalers and other customers and suppliers  the decline of health insurance coverage in the overall population  and the federal government s involvement in the economic crisis 
we believe that cash generated from operations  along with available cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs  including debt service  capital expenditures  costs associated with litigation and government investigations  and dividends in we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short term borrowings 
our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected by the recent illiquidity in the market because of the high credit quality of our short and long term debt 
in  we intend to fund payments required in connection with the edpa settlements  and to further reduce outstanding commercial paper with cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash generated from operations  and the issuance of longterm debt 
we currently have billion of unused committed bank credit facilities  billion of which backs our commercial paper program 
additionally  in november  we obtained a one year short term revolving credit facility in the amount of billion as back up  alternative financing 
various risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in the financial expectations for section  may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 
chart in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values 
these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing  investing  and operating 
we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short term us dollar interest rates 
in an effort to manage interest rate exposures  we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance 
based on our overall interest rate exposure at december  and  including derivatives and other interest rate risk sensitive instruments  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december  and  respectively  would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of interest rate risksensitive instruments over a one year period 
our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen  and the british pound against the euro 
we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than the local currency 
we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
we may use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures 
our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures 
gains and losses on these derivative positions offset  in part  the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets  liabilities  commitments  and anticipated revenues 
considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december  and  a hypothetical percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december  and  respectively  would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of foreign currency rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset  in part  by the results of the derivative instruments 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
we acquire and collaborate on assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development 
milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg  approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels 
if required by the arrangement  we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained 
because of the contingent nature of these payments  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 
individually  these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period 
however  if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period  the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period 
these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product  which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments  however  we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives 
we also note that  from a business perspective  we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 
our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt  including interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet other total our long term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps 
we used the interest rate forward curve at december  to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps 
we have included the following purchase obligations  consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of december  some of these purchase orders may be cancelable  however  for purposes of this disclosure  we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations 
contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors  which are noncancelable and are not contingent 
we have included long term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities 
we excluded liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of million  as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities 
this category comprises primarily minimum pension funding requirements 
the contractual obligations table is current as of december  we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed  terminated  or modified 
application of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
we believe that  given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or liquidity for the periods presented in this report 
our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 
revenue recognition and sales return  rebate  and discount accruals we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
for more than percent of our sales  this is at the time products are shipped to the customer  typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain 
the remaining sales  which are outside the us  are recorded at the point of delivery 
provisions for returns  rebates  and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us  primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products  or alternative approaches 
we attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio 
causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues  weather patterns  anticipated changes in the transportation network  redundant holiday stocking  and changes in wholesaler business operations 
in the us  the current structure of our arrangements eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our wholesalers 
when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand  we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend  however  we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking 
wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns 
we establish sales return accruals for anticipated product returns 
we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net sales 
once the product is returned  it is destroyed 
consistent with sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists  we estimate a reserve when the sales occur for future product returns related to those sales 
this estimate is primarily based on historical return rates as well as specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates 
actual product returns have been approximately one percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 
we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales 
the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales 
sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid  managed care  medicare  chargebacks  long term care  hospital  patient assistance programs  and various other government programs 
we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts 
the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends  an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations  the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients  and our product pricing and current rebate and discount contracts 
although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped  the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later 
because of this time lag  in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 
most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales 
in some large european countries  government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country 
a best estimate of these rebates  updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits  is recognized in the same period as the related sale 
if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit  we adjust our rebate reserves 
we believe that our accruals for sales returns  rebates  and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
sales returns  federally mandated medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs medicaid and medicare rebates reduced sales by billion  million  and million in   and  respectively 
a percent change in the sales return  medicaid  and medicare rebate amounts we recognized in would lead to an approximate million effect on our income before income taxes 
as of december   our sales returns  medicaid  and medicare rebate liability was million 
our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet 
our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
approximately percent and percent of our global sales return  rebate  and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the us as of december  and  respectively 
the following represents a roll forward of our most significant us returns  rebate  and discount liability balances  including medicaid in millions sales return  rebate  and discount liabilities  beginning of year reduction of net sales due to sales returns  discounts  and rebates cash payments of discounts and rebates sales return  rebate  and discount liabilities  end of year adjustments of the estimates for these returns  rebates  and discounts to actual results were less than percent of net sales for each of the years presented 
product litigation liabilities and other contingencies product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are  by their nature  uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities 
the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation  the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases  the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation  and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions  if any 
in addition  we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred  but not filed  to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs 
we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage 
we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 
we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance 
in assessing our insurance coverage  we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions  the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company  the financial condition of the insurers  and the possibility of and length of time for collection 
in the past few years  we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market 
therefore  for substantially all of our currently marketed products  we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self insured for future product liability losses 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future 
the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
pension and retiree medical plan assumptions pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  and expected return on plan assets 
retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
in addition to the analysis below  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 
periodically  we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans 
in evaluating these assumptions  we consider many factors  including an evaluation of the discount rates  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates of other companies  our historical assumptions compared with actual results  an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations approximately percent to percent of which are growth investments  and the views of leading financial advisers and economists 
we use an actuarially determined  company specific yield curve to determine the discount rate 
in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption  we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 
we believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 
if the health care cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year  the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the annual expense would increase by approximately million 
a one percentage point decrease would lower the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost by approximately million 
if the discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes would change by approximately million 
if the expected return on plan assets for us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes would change by approximately million 
if our assumption regarding the expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year  our income before income taxes would be affected by approximately million 
the us plans represent approximately percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately percent of total plan assets at december  impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value 
if an impairment is identified  a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s net book value over its fair value  and the cost basis is adjusted 
the estimated future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
income taxes we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities  which may result in future tax  interest  and penalty assessments by these authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation  and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances 
for example  adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities  new information obtained during a tax examination  or resolution of an examination 
we believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns 
we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets  primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions 
in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets  we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption 
implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 
we believe that our estimates for the uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
a percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately million and million  respectively 
financial expectations for for the full year of  we expect earnings per share to be in the range of to 
we expect volume growth in sales again in  driven by cymbalta  alimta  cialis  humalog  and the anticipated launches of prasugrel  as well as by the elanco animal health division 
however  the negative impact of weaker foreign currencies  worldwide pricing pressures  and the impact of generic competition in certain markets for gemzar are anticipated to partially offset these positive impacts 
as a result  we expect mid single digit sales growth 
we expect gross margin as a percent of net sales to increase  driven by the strengthening dollar 
this increase could be more pronounced in the first half of marketing  selling  and administrative expenses are expected to show flat to low single digit growth 
research and development expenses are projected to grow in the low double digits 
other net is expected to be a net loss of between million and million 
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately billion  and we expect continued strong operating cash flow 
actual results could differ materially and will depend on  among other things  the continuing growth of our currently marketed products  developments with competitive products  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches  asset impairments  restructurings  and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired in process research and development charges  foreign exchange rates and global macroeconomic conditions  changes in effective tax rates  wholesaler inventory changes  other regulatory developments  litigation  and government investigations  and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing  importation  and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals 
we undertake no duty to update these forward looking statements 
legal and regulatory matters we are a party to various legal actions and government investigations 
the most significant of these are described below 
while it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters  we believe that  except as specifically noted below  the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity  but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period 
patent litigation we are engaged in the following patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the hatch waxman act the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of cymbalta sixteen generic drug manufacturers have submitted andas seeking permission to market generic versions of cymbalta prior to the expiration of our relevant us patents the earliest of which expires in 
of these challengers  all allege non infringement of the patent claims directed to the commercial formulation  and eight allege invalidity of the patent claims directed to the active ingredient duloxetine 
of the eight challengers to the compound patent claims  one further alleges invalidity of the claims directed to the use of cymbalta for treating fibromyalgia  and one alleges the patent having claims directed to the active ingredient is unenforceable 
lawsuits have been filed in us district court for the southern district of indiana against activis elizabeth llc  aurobindo pharma ltd  cobalt laboratories  inc  impax laboratories  inc  lupin limited  sandoz inc  sun pharma global  inc  and wockhardt limited  seeking rulings that the patents are valid  infringed  and enforceable 
answers to the complaints are pending 
gemzar sicor pharmaceuticals  inc sicor  mayne pharma usa inc 
mayne  and sun pharmaceutical industries inc sun each submitted an anda seeking permission to market generic versions of gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant us patents compound patent expiring in and method of use patent expiring in  and alleging that these patents are invalid 
we filed lawsuits in the us district court for the southern district of indiana against sicor february and mayne october and january  seeking rulings that these patents are valid and are being infringed 
the suit against sicor has been scheduled for trial in july sicor s andas have been approved by the fda  however  sicor must provide days notice prior to marketing generic gemzar to allow time for us to seek a preliminary injunction 
both suits against mayne have been administratively closed  and the parties have agreed to be bound by the results of the sicor suit 
in november  sun filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan  seeking rulings that our method of use and compound patents are invalid or unenforceable  or would not be infringed by the sale of sun s generic product 
this trial is scheduled for december alimta teva parenteral medicines  inc teva and app pharmaceuticals  llc app each submitted andas seeking approval to market generic versions of alimta prior to the expiration of the relevant us patent licensed from the trustees of princeton university and expiring in  and alleging the patent is invalid 
we  along with princeton  filed lawsuits in the us district court for the district of delaware against teva and app  seeking rulings that the compound patent is valid and infringed 
trial is scheduled for november  evista barr laboratories  inc barr submitted an anda in seeking permission to market a generic version of evista prior to the expiration of our relevant us patents expiring in and alleging that these patents are invalid  not enforceable  or not infringed 
in november  we filed a lawsuit against barr in the us district court for the southern district of indiana  seeking a ruling that these patents are valid  enforceable  and being infringed by barr 
teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc teva has also submitted an anda seeking permission to market a generic version of evista 
in june  we filed a similar lawsuit against teva in the us district court for the southern district of indiana 
the lawsuit against teva is currently scheduled for trial beginning march   while no trial date has been set in the lawsuit against barr 
in april  the fda granted teva tentative approval of its anda  but teva s ability to market a generic product is subject to a statutory stay  which has been extended to expire on march  if the stay expires and the company cannot obtain preliminary relief from the court  teva can launch its generic product  regardless of the status of the current litigation  but subject to our right to recover damages  should we prevail at trial 
we believe each of these hatch waxman challenges is without merit and expect to prevail in this litigation 
however  it is not possible to determine the outcome of this litigation  and accordingly  we can provide no assurance that we will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome in any of these cases could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
we have received challenges to zyprexa patents in a number of countries outside the us in canada  several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have challenged the validity of our zyprexa compound and method of use patent expiring in 
in april  the canadian federal court ruled against the first challenger  apotex inc apotex  and that ruling was affirmed on appeal in february in june  the canadian federal court held that an invalidity allegation of a second challenger  novopharm ltd 
novopharm  was justified and denied our request that novopharm be prohibited from receiving marketing approval for generic olanzapine in canada 
novopharm began selling generic olanzapine in canada in the third quarter of we sued novopharm for patent infringement  and the trial began in november we expect the trial to run through the first quarter of  with a decision in the second half of in november  apotex filed an action seeking a declaration of the invalidity of our zyprexa compound and method of use patents  and no trial date has been set 
we have brought similar actions against pharmascience august  sandoz july  nu pharm june  genpharm june and cobalt january  none of these suits has been scheduled for trial 
pharmascience has agreed to be bound by the outcome of the novopharm suit  and  pending the outcome of the lawsuit  we have agreed not to take any further steps to prevent the company from coming to market with generic olanzapine tablets  subject to a contingent damages obligation should we be successful against novopharm 
in germany  generic pharmaceutical manufacturers egis gyogyszergyar and neolab ltd 
challenged the validity of our zyprexa compound and method of use patent expiring in 
in june  the german federal patent court held that our patent is invalid 
generic olanzapine was launched by competitors in germany in the fourth quarter of we appealed the decision to the german federal supreme court and following a hearing in december  the supreme court reversed the federal patent court and found the patent to be valid 
following the decision of the supreme court  the generic companies either agreed to withdraw from the market or were subject to preliminary injunction 
we are pursuing these companies for damages arising from infringement 
we have received challenges in a number of other countries  including spain  the united kingdom uk  france  and several smaller european countries 
in spain  we have been successful at both the trial and appellate court levels in defeating the generic manufacturers challenges  but further legal challenge is now pending before the commercial court in madrid 
in the uk  the generic pharmaceutical manufacturer dr 
reddy s laboratories uk limited has challenged the validity of our zyprexa compound and method of use patent expiring in 
in october  the patents court in the high court  london ruled that our patent was valid 
dr 
reddy s appealed this decision  and a hearing date for the appeal has not been set 
we are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our zyprexa patents on a country by country basis 
we cannot determine the outcome of this litigation 
the availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations 
xigris and evista in june  ariad pharmaceuticals  inc  the massachusetts institute of technology  the whitehead institute for biomedical research  and the president and fellows of harvard college in the us district court for the district of massachusetts sued us  alleging that sales of two of our products  xigris and evista  were inducing the infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body  and seeking royalties on past and future sales of these products 
on may   a jury in boston issued an initial decision in the case that xigris and evista sales infringe the patent 
the jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately million in damages  calculated by applying a percent royalty to all us sales of xigris and evista from the date of issuance of the patent through the date of trial 
in addition  a separate bench trial with the us district court of massachusetts was held in august  on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and impermissibly covers natural processes 
in june  the united states patent and trademark office uspto commenced a reexamination of the patent  and in august took the position that the ariad claims at issue are unpatentable  a position that ariad continues to contest 
in september  the court entered a final judgment indicating that ariad s claims are patentable  valid  and enforceable  and finding damages in the amount of million plus a percent royalty on net us sales of xigris and evista since the time of the jury decision 
however  the court deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all rights to appeal have been exhausted 
we have appealed this judgment 
the court of appeals for the federal circuit heard oral arguments on the appeal on february  we believe that these allegations are without legal merit  that we will ultimately prevail on these issues  and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote 
government investigations and related litigation in march  the office of the us attorney for the edpa advised us that it had commenced an investigation related to our us marketing and promotional practices  including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors  with respect to zyprexa  prozac  and prozac weekly 
in addition  the state medicaid fraud control units of more than states coordinated with the edpa in its investigation of any medicaid related claims relating to our marketing and promotion of zyprexa 
in january  we announced that we reached resolution of this matter 
as part of the resolution  we pled guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the food  drug  and cosmetic act and agreed to pay million 
the misdemeanor plea is for the off label promotion of zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia  including alzheimer s dementia  between september and march we have also entered into a settlement agreement resolving the federal civil claims  under which we will pay approximately million  although we do not admit to the allegations 
we have also agreed to settle the civil investigations brought by the state medicaid fraud control units of the states that have coordinated with the edpa in its investigation  and will make available a maximum amount of approximately million for payment to those states that agree to settle 
the charge we recorded for this matter in the third quarter of billion will be sufficient to cover these payments 
also  as part of the settlement  we have entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general oig of the us department of health and human services hhs 
this agreement will require us to maintain our compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for five years 
the agreement also provides for an independent third party review organization to assess and report on the company s systems  processes  policies  procedures and practices 
in june  we received a subpoena from the office of the attorney general  medicaid fraud control unit  of the state of florida  seeking production of documents relating to sales of zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa 
in september  we received a subpoena from the california attorney general s office seeking production of documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain zyprexa s status on california s formulary  marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa  and remuneration of health care providers 
we expect these matters to be resolved if florida and california participate in the state component of the edpa resolution 
beginning in august  we received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states under various state consumer protection laws 
most of these requests became part of a multistate investigative effort coordinated by an executive committee of attorneys general 
in october  we reached a settlement with states and the district of columbia 
while there is no finding that we have violated any provision of the state laws under which the investigations were conducted  we paid million and agreed to undertake certain commitments regarding zyprexa for a period of six years  through consent decrees filed in the settling states 
the states participating in the settlement are alabama  arizona  california  delaware  florida  hawaii  illinois  indiana  iowa  kansas  maine  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  missouri  nebraska  nevada  new jersey  new york  north carolina  north dakota  ohio  oklahoma  oregon  pennsylvania  rhode island  south dakota  tennessee  texas  vermont  washington  and wisconsin 
product liability and related litigation we have been named as a defendant in a large number of zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the us and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit 
the lawsuits and unfiled claims together the claims allege a variety of injuries from the use of zyprexa  with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels 
the claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of zyprexa 
many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug 
almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a multi district litigation mdl proceeding before the honorable jack weinstein in the federal district court for the eastern district of new york mdl no 

since june  we have entered into agreements with various claimants attorneys involved in us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims 
the agreements cover a total of approximately  claimants  including a large number of previously filed lawsuits and other asserted claims 
the two primary settlements were as follows in june  we reached an agreement in principle and in september a final agreement to settle more than  claims for million plus million to cover administration of the settlement 
in january  we reached agreements with a number of plaintiffs attorneys to settle more than  claims for approximately million 
the settlement totaling million was paid during the january settlements were paid during we are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of zyprexa in all remaining claims 
the us zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately lawsuits in the us covering approximately plaintiffs  of which about cases covering about plaintiffs are part of the mdl 
no trials have been scheduled related to these claims 
in early  we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in canada on behalf of patients who took zyprexa 
one of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of quebec  and a second has been certified in ontario and includes all canadian residents except for residents of quebec and british columbia 
the allegations in the canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the us since the beginning of  we have recorded aggregate net pretax charges of billion for zyprexa product liability matters 
the net charges  which take into account our actual insurance recoveries  covered the following the cost of the zyprexa product liability settlements to date  and reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs regarding the known zyprexa product liability claims and expected future claims to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims 
in december  we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in louisiana on behalf of the louisiana department of health and hospitals  alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels  and that we improperly promoted the drug 
these cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the mdl proceedings in the eastern district of new york edny 
in these actions  the department of health and hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for zyprexa through medicaid and other drug benefit programs  as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat zyprexa related illnesses 
we have been served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of alaska  arkansas  connecticut  idaho  minnesota  mississippi  montana  new mexico  pennsylvania  south carolina  utah  and west virginia in the courts of the respective states 
the connecticut  louisiana  minnesota  mississippi  montana  new mexico  and west virginia cases are part of the mdl proceedings in the edny 
the alaska case was settled in march for a payment of million  plus terms designed to ensure  subject to certain limitations and conditions  that alaska is treated as favorably as certain other states that may settle with us in the future over similar claims 
the following cases have been set for trial in connecticut in the edny in june  pennsylvania in november  and south carolina in august  in their respective states 
in  two lawsuits were filed in the edny purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third party payors  excluding governmental entities  which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed zyprexa 
these actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit  which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes  the federal civil rico statute  and common law theories  seeking a refund of the cost of zyprexa  treble damages  punitive damages  and attorneys fees 
two additional lawsuits were filed in the edny in on similar grounds 
in september  judge weinstein certified a class consisting of third party payors  excluding governmental entities and individual consumers 
we appealed the certification order  and judge weinstein s order denying our motion for summary judgment  in september in  the pennsylvania employees trust fund brought claims in state court in pennsylvania as insurer of pennsylvania state employees  who were prescribed zyprexa on similar grounds as described in the new york cases 
as with the product liability suits  these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug 
the pennsylvania case is set for trial in october we cannot determine with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted 
the ultimate resolution of zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
in addition  we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol des and thimerosal 
the majority of these claims are covered by insurance  subject to deductibles and coverage limits 
because of the nature of pharmaceutical products  it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future 
in the past few years  we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market 
therefore  for substantially all of our currently marketed products  we have been and expect that we will continue to be completely self insured for future product liability losses 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers in the future
