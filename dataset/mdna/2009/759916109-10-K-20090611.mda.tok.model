overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of novel therapeutics for radiology and neuropsychiatry 
a number of drug development programs are currently being conducted to evaluate our drug candidates in diseases such as pancreatitis  bipolar disorder and friedreich s ataxia 
in addition  we sell two commercial products  protein a for monoclonal antibody purification and secreflo for assessment of pancreatic disorders 
we also receive royalties from bristol myers squibb company bristol for their net sales in the united states of their product orencia 
total revenue in fiscal year increased significantly due to the bristol royalty 
this increase was offset partly by a decrease in sales and profits in our commercial products business as we discontinued sales of secreflo and experienced lower customer demand for our protein a products due to the current economic environment 
we seek to invest the profits from our current commercial products and royalty and other revenues as well as our existing financial resources to advance the development of our therapeutic product candidates through proof of principle clinical trials while also supporting our business development activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates while our significant accounting polices are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements  we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition we apply staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
to our revenue arrangements 
we generate product revenues from the sale of our protein a products to customers in the pharmaceutical and process chromatography industries and from the sale of secreflo to hospital based gastroenterologists 
in accordance with sab no 
 we recognize revenue related to product sales upon delivery of the product to the customer as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
determination of whether these criteria have been met are based on management s judgments primarily regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for product delivered  and the collectibility of those fees 
we have a few longstanding customers who 
table of contents comprise the majority of our revenue and have excellent payment history 
we have had no significant write offs of uncollectible invoices in the periods presented 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
at the time of sale  we also evaluate the need to accrue for warranty and sales returns 
the supply agreements we have with our customers and related purchase orders identify the terms and conditions of each sale and the price of the goods ordered 
due to the nature of our sales arrangements  inventory produced for sale is tested for quality specifications prior to shipment 
since the product is manufactured to order and in compliance with required specifications prior to shipment  the likelihood of sales returns  warranty or other issues is largely diminished 
sales returns and warranty issues are infrequent and have had nominal impact on our financial statements historically 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine that warranty  returns or other sale related reserves are necessary for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
in april  we settled our outstanding litigation with bristol 
we have therefore begun recognizing royalty revenue in fiscal year for bristol s net sales in the united states of orencia which is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
pursuant to the bristol settlement  we have recognized  in royalty revenue in fiscal  which includes a million initial payment and million for sales of orencia prior to fiscal  in addition to royalties earned on sales of orencia during our fiscal revenue earned from bristol royalties are recorded in the periods when they are earned based on royalty reports sent by bristol to the company 
additionally  during fiscal years  and  the company earned and recognized approximately   and  respectively in royalty revenue from chirhoclin for their sales of secretin 
revenue earned from chirhoclin royalties are recorded in the periods when they are earned based on royalty reports sent by chirhoclin to the company 
during fiscal  we recognized approximately  and  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association mda and comitato rudi onlus gofar gofar  respectively 
during the fiscal years ended march  and march   we recognized  and  respectively  of revenue from a sponsored research and development project under an agreement with the stanley medical research institute 
research revenue is recognized when the expense has been incurred and services have been performed 
determination of which costs incurred qualify for reimbursement under the terms of our contractual agreements and the timing of when such costs were incurred involves the judgment of management 
our calculations are based upon the agreed upon terms as stated in our arrangements 
however  should our estimated calculations change or be challenged by other parties to the agreements  research revenue may be adjusted in subsequent periods 
our calculations have not historically changed or been challenged and we do not anticipate any subsequent change in our revenue related to sponsored research and development projects 
there have been no material changes to our initial estimates related to revenue recognition in any periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
inventories inventories relate to our protein a business 
we value inventory at cost or  if lower  fair market value 
we determine cost using the first in  first out method 
we review our inventories at least quarterly and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on our estimates of expected sales volume  production capacity and expiration dates of raw materials  work in process and finished products 
expected sales volumes are determined based on supply forecasts provided by our key customers for the next three to twelve months 
we 
table of contents write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  and inventory in excess of expected requirements to cost of product revenue 
manufacturing of protein a finished goods is done primarily to order and tested for quality specifications prior to shipment 
a change in the estimated timing or amount of demand for our products could result in additional provisions for excess inventory quantities on hand 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or unexpected quality failures could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
during all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements  there have been no material adjustments related to a revised estimate of inventory valuations 
accrued liabilities the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require that the company estimate accrued liabilities 
this process involves identifying services performed on the company s behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials 
these expenses are normally determined through a contract or purchase order issued by the company  service fees paid to organizations for their performance in conducting clinical trials 
these expenses are determined by contracts in place for those services and communications with project managers on costs which have been incurred as of each reporting date  professional and consulting fees incurred with law firms  audit and accounting service providers and other third party consultants 
these expenses are determined by either requesting those service providers to estimate unbilled services at each reporting date for services incurred  or tracking costs incurred by service providers under fixed fee arrangements 
the company has processes in place to estimate the appropriate amounts to record for accrued liabilities  which principally involve the applicable personnel reviewing the services provided 
in the event that the company does not identify certain costs which have begun to be incurred or the company under or over estimates the level of services performed or the costs of such services  the reported expenses for that period may be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often judgmental 
the company makes these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known at the date of the financial statements 
a change in the estimated cost or volume of services provided could result in additional accrued liabilities 
any significant unanticipated changes in such estimates could have a significant impact on our accrued liabilities and reported operating results 
there has been no material adjustments to our accrued liabilities in any of the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
stock based compensation we apply the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  or sfas no 
r 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards on the grant date 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is derived from our historical stock option exercise experience and option expiration data 
the expected life of stock options granted is based on the simplified method allowable under sab no 
accordingly  the expected term is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
in addition  for purposes of estimating the expected term  we have aggregated all individual option awards into one group as we do not expect substantial differences in exercise behavior among its employees 
the expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of options granted 
we determined the expected volatility based upon the historical 
table of contents volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term  exclusive of any events not reasonably anticipated to recur over the option s expected term 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the option s expected term on the grant date 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of our capital stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we use an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option 
we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period based upon options that are ultimately expected to vest  and accordingly  such compensation expense has been adjusted by an amount of estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures represent only the unvested portion of a surrendered option 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we accounted for forfeitures upon occurrence as permitted under sfas no 
based on an analysis of historical data  we have calculated an annual forfeiture rate for non director level employees  a annual forfeiture rate for director level employees  and a forfeiture rate for non employee members of the board of directors  which we believe is a reasonable assumption to estimate forfeitures 
however  the estimation of forfeitures requires significant judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
for the years ended march   and  we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately   and  respectively  for stock options granted under the amended and restated repligen corporation stock plan 
as of march   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share based awards 
this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining requisite service period of years 
the company expects approximately  of unvested shares of common stock pursuant to outstanding options to vest over the next five years 
results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and the related footnotes thereto 
revenues total revenues for fiscal  and were   and  and were primarily comprised of sales of our commercial products  protein a and secreflo  and royalties 
during fiscal  and  our total revenue was comprised of year ended march change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except percentages protein a secreflo product revenue royalty and other revenue total revenue substantially all of our products based on recombinant protein a are sold to customers who incorporate our manufactured products into their proprietary antibody purification systems to be sold directly to the pharmaceutical industry 
monoclonal antibodies are a well established class of drug with applications in rheumatoid arthritis  
table of contents asthma  crohn s disease and a variety of cancers 
sales of protein a are therefore impacted by the timing of large scale production orders and on the regulatory approvals for such antibodies  which may result in significant quarterly fluctuations 
the company sells different protein a products at different price points 
the mix of products sold varies and impacts the fluctuations in total product revenue from year to year 
during fiscal  protein a sales decreased by  or as compared to fiscal volume decreased due to decreased demand from certain key customers in reaction to the current credit crisis and other business events 
we sell various forms of recombinant and immobilized protein a products at different price points depending on the nature of the product sold 
changes in the mix of products sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal comprised the remaining decrease 
fiscal protein a sales increased by  or over fiscal we shipped more volume of protein a in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased demand by our customers as the monoclonal antibody market continued to grow 
the increase in volume predominantly drove the increase in protein a revenue  with price increases comprising the difference 
we anticipate that sales of protein a will decline in fiscal as consumers and our customers continue to respond to the economic environment by migrating towards just in time purchasing  reducing their inventory levels and optimizing cash flow 
as a result  our protein a sales may be subject to quarterly fluctuations due to the timing of large scale production orders 
sales of secreflo decreased  in fiscal as we discontinued selling this product in the second quarter of fiscal in fiscal  sales of secreflo increased  compared to fiscal primarily as a result of increased sales to new customers and higher prices 
the settlement in fiscal with our sole supplier of secreflo provided for a certain amount of vials of product that we could ultimately ship 
the final shipment of secreflo to the company from chirhoclin was received in fiscal and we discontinued selling secreflo in the second quarter of fiscal in april  we settled our outstanding litigation with bristol 
we have therefore begun recognizing royalty revenue in fiscal year for bristol s net sales in the united states of orencia which is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
pursuant to the bristol settlement  we have recognized  in royalty revenue in fiscal  which includes a million initial payment and million for sales of orencia prior to fiscal  in addition to royalties earned on sales of orencia during our fiscal also  during fiscal years  and  we earned and recognized approximately   and  respectively  in royalty revenue from chirhoclin 
for fiscal  we expect royalty revenues to decline as fiscal included certain initial payments and prior year activity that will not recur in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized approximately  of revenue from a sponsored research and development project under a grant agreement with the muscular dystrophy association mda 
we also recognized  of revenue under a grant agreement with gofar in fiscal during the fiscal and  we recognized  and  respectively  of revenue from a sponsored research and development project under a cost plus fixed fee agreement with the stanley medical research institute 
in fiscal  we recognized  under an agreement with the friedreich s ataxia research alliance 
we expect research and license revenues will remain reasonably consistent in fiscal as the mda grant related effort continues 

table of contents costs and operating expenses total costs and operating expenses for fiscal  and consist of the following year ended march  change vs 
vs 
in thousands costs and operating expenses cost of product revenue cost of royalty and other revenue research and development selling  general and administrative net gain from litigation settlement total operating expenses the decrease in cost of product revenue of  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in protein a sales 
this decrease is partially offset by increased direct labor costs of approximately  due primarily to additional quality assurance and control personnel hired to meet growing customer demands for increased product quality assurance efforts and to support iso certification 
it is also partially offset by higher depreciation and occupancy costs of approximately  primarily associated with our manufacturing and administrative expansion at a second site located in waltham  ma 
the increase in cost of product revenue of  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal is attributable primarily to a increase in product sales 
in addition  fiscal revenue growth was driven by lower margin products  resulting in a greater increase in cost of product revenue 
specifically  these newer products were produced on a lower scale  resulting in higher overall production and quality costs per unit sold 
further  depreciation costs increased  associated with expansion of our fermentation facility  and occupancy costs increased  due to our expanded facilities 
in fiscal  we expensed  for cost of royalty due to the university of michigan under the bristol settlement 
per the bristol settlement  after deducting approximately  of legal costs incurred related to the settlement  the company must remit of bristol royalties to the university of michigan 
research and development costs primarily include costs of internal personnel  external research collaborations  clinical trials and the costs associated with the manufacturing and testing of clinical materials 
we currently have ongoing research and development programs that support our product candidates of secretin and uridine 
in addition  we are involved with a number of early stage programs that may or may not be further developed 
due to the small size of the company and the fact that these various programs share personnel and fixed costs such as facility costs  depreciation  and supplies  we do not track all our expenses by program 
each of our therapeutic research and development programs is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the requirement to seek regulatory approvals that are outside of our control 
for example  our clinical trials may be subject to delays based on our inability to enroll patients at the rate that we expect to meet the schedule for our planned clinical trials 
moreover  the product candidates identified in these research programs  particularly in our early stage programs must overcome significant technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
for example  results from our preclinical animal models may not be replicated in our clinical trials with humans 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to predict with any certainty the period in which material net cash inflows from such projects could be expected to commence or the completion date of these programs 
these risks and uncertainties also prevent us from estimating with any certainty the specific timing and future costs of our research and development programs  although historical trends within the industry suggest that 
table of contents expenses tend to increase in later stages of development 
collaborations with commercial vendors and academic researchers accounted for   and of our research and development expenses for fiscal   and  respectively 
the outsourcing of such services provides us flexibility to discontinue or increase spending depending on the success of our research and development programs 
during fiscal  research and development expenses increased by  or as compared to fiscal this increase is comprised primarily of  related to the continued phase clinical trial for rg  evaluating the use of human secretin in aiding pancreatic imaging   related to the phase b clinical trial for rg  evaluating the use of uridine to treat bipolar depression and  related to friedreich s ataxia as we continue to search for a drug candidate 
additionally  there were increased personnel expenses of  primarily due to headcount additions in clinical  regulatory and research and development areas 
during fiscal  research and development expenses increased by  or as compared to fiscal this increase was largely attributable to a  increase in spending related to friedreich s ataxia as we continued to search for a drug candidate 
this increase in spending for friedreich s ataxia includes  relating to common stock issued to the scripps research institute and its designees for the acquisition of a license to use  commercialize and sublicense certain patented technology and improvements thereon  owned or licensed by scripps 
spending related to uridine for bipolar disorder also increased  as we continued our phase a trials 
spending related to secretin for diagnostic imaging decreased by  as we completed our phase trial and began preparations for phase in early fiscal future research and development expenses are dependent on a number of variables  including the cost and design of clinical trials and external costs such as manufacturing of clinical materials 
we expect our research and development expenses in fiscal to increase moderately as we continue our clinical trials for uridine to treat bipolar depression and secretin to improve pancreatic diagnostic imaging 
in anticipation of positive clinical trial results  we will prepare a new drug application for submission to the fda 
we will also continue our search efforts to identify a drug candidate 
additionally  there may be further increases in expenses if we acquire additional product candidates 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include the associated costs with selling our commercial products and costs required to support our research and development efforts including legal  accounting  patent  shareholder services and other administrative functions 
in addition  sg a expenses have historically included costs associated with various litigation matters 
in fiscal  sg a costs decreased by  or as compared to fiscal this decrease is primarily due to  of litigation costs incurred prior to fiscal relating to the bristol and imclone settlements  and a  decrease in recruiting and relocation costs as certain key board and management positions were filled in fiscal these decreases are partially offset by increased personnel expenses of  primarily due to headcount increases in marketing and business development including salaries and stock based compensation 
during fiscal  sg a costs increased by approximately  or as compared to fiscal this increase was mainly the result of  of incremental litigation costs associated with our patent infringement lawsuits against bristol and other patent prosecution costs 
as noted below  the company also incurred an additional  of litigation costs associated with the imclone settlement 
the company also incurred additional recruiting and related costs of  due to the turnover of certain board of director and employee positions 
we expect sg a expenses to increase moderately in fiscal primarily due to slightly higher headcount and related personnel expenses 

table of contents net gain from litigation settlement on september   repligen and mit entered into the imclone settlement relating to the lawsuit against imclone for infringement of the patent 
pursuant to the imclone settlement  imclone made a payment of million to repligen and mit that resulted in net proceeds to repligen of  after litigation costs of  and proceeds to mit of  the imclone settlement served as the basis to dismiss the lawsuit against imclone and for repligen to grant imclone a non exclusive sublicense to the patent and certain other intellectual property 
investment income investment income includes income earned on invested cash balances 
investment income for fiscal  and was approximately   and  respectively 
the decrease of  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal is attributable to lower interest rates resulting from overall economic conditions 
the increase of  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal is attributable to higher overall cash and marketable securities  up  due primarily to the proceeds from the imclone litigation 
we expect interest income to vary based on changes in the amount of funds invested and fluctuation of interest rates 
provision for income taxes in fiscal  the company was liable for alternative minimum tax  for which net operating loss carryforwards are only partially deductible 
as a result  the company had an effective tax rate of as we provided  for income taxes in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities  revenues derived from product sales  grants  as well as proceeds and royalties from litigation settlements 
our revenue for the foreseeable future will be limited to our protein a product revenue  royalties from bristol  and research and development grants 
given the uncertainties related to pharmaceutical product development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our therapeutic product candidates will generate revenue and cash flows 
at march   we had cash and marketable securities of  compared to  at march  deposits for leased office space of  is classified as restricted cash and is not included in cash and marketable securities total for either or cash flows in thousands year ended march  cash provided by used in increase decrease increase decrease operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities in fiscal  our operating activities provided cash of  which reflects net income of approximately  which includes non cash charges totaling approximately  including depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation charges

table of contents in fiscal  our operating activities provided cash of  which reflects net income of approximately  which includes non cash charges totaling approximately  including depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation charges and the acquisition of the scripps license for stock 
the remaining cash flow used in operations resulted from unfavorable changes in various working capital accounts

in fiscal  our investing activities consumed  of cash  which is primarily due to net purchases of marketable debt securities of  we also spent  in capital expenditures as we continued to upgrade both our research and development and manufacturing capabilities 
we place our marketable security investments in high quality credit instruments as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
financing activities in fiscal  the repurchase of common stock consumed  exercises of stock options provided cash receipts of  in fiscal  exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations as of march   we had the following fixed obligations and commitments payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations contractual obligations total these amounts include payments for license  supply and consulting agreements 
capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the success of our clinical studies  the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities  our ability to acquire additional products or product candidates  the extent of any share repurchase activity  the success of any proposed financing efforts  and the ability to sustain sales and profits of our commercial products 
absent acquisitions of additional products  product candidates or intellectual property  we believe our current cash balances are adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next twenty four months 
we expect to incur increased expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal this is due to anticipated increases in clinical 
table of contents study expenses and research and development efforts as well as increased personnel expenses 
our future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  continued investment in our research and development programs  capital expenditures primarily associated with purchases of equipment and continued investment in our intellectual property portfolio 
we plan to continue to invest in key research and development activities 
we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis  including licensing or acquiring complementary products  technologies or businesses that would complement our existing portfolio of development programs 
we continue to seek to acquire such potential assets that may offer us the best opportunity to create value for our shareholders 
in order to acquire such assets  we may need to seek additional financing to fund these investments 
this may require the issuance or sale of additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
should we need to secure additional financing to acquire a product  fund future investment in research and development  or meet our future liquidity requirements  we may not be able to secure such financing  or obtain such financing on favorable terms because of the volatile nature of the biotechnology marketplace 
net operating loss carryforwards at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  research and development credit carryforwards of approximately  and other tax credits of  available to reduce future federal income taxes  if any 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will continue to expire at various dates  if not used 
net operating loss carryforwards and available tax credits are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service and may be limited in the event of certain changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders 
we did not record a tax provision in the fiscal statement of operations as we did not generate taxable income 
in fiscal and  we utilized our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our income tax provision 
effects of inflation our assets are primarily monetary  consisting of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
since we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r and sfas no 
 accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
these standards will significantly change the accounting and reporting for business combination transactions and noncontrolling minority interests in financial statements  including capitalizing at the acquisition date the fair value of acquired in process research and development projects  and remeasuring and writing down these assets  if necessary  in subsequent periods during their development 
the new standards will be applied prospectively for business combinations that occur for the company on or after april   except that presentation and disclosure requirements of sfas regarding minority interests shall be applied retrospectively

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have investments in commercial paper  us government and agency securities as well as corporate bonds and other debt securities 
as a result  we are exposed to potential loss from market risks that may occur as a result of changes in interest rates  changes in credit quality of the issuer or otherwise 
we generally place our marketable security investments in high quality credit instruments  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of march  however  the conservative nature of our investments mitigates our interest rate exposure  and our investment policy limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue  issuer with the exception of us treasury obligations and type of instrument 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable security investments due to interest rate fluctuations and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is limited 
we intend to hold these investments to maturity  in accordance with our business plans
