overview we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation internet auction style sales technology  which we refer to as vb sellers are primarily insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions  charities  car dealerships  fleet operators  vehicle rental companies and the general public 
we sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers  rebuilders  repair licensees  used vehicle dealers and exporters  however at certain locations  we sell directly to the general public 
the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of the insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made 
we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and processing costs 
in the united states and canada  or north america  we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage 
in the united kingdom  or uk  we operate primarily on a principal basis  purchasing salvage vehicles outright from insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account 
our revenues consist of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers  transportation revenue  purchased vehicle revenues  and other remarketing services 
revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or  under our percentage incentive program  or pip program  where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price 
under the fixed fee program  we generally charge an 
table of contents additional fee for title processing and special preparation 
although sometimes included in the consignment fee  we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility  storage of the vehicle  and other incidental costs 
under the consignment programs  only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue  not the actual sales price gross proceeds 
sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles  storage  loading and annual registration 
transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts 
transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles 
purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk 
operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management  clerical and yard employees  rent  contract vehicle towing  insurance  fuel  equipment maintenance and repair  and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts 
costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management  accounting  data processing  sales personnel  human resources  professional fees  research and development and marketing expenses 
during fiscal and fiscal  we converted all of our north american and uk sales  respectively  to an internet based auction style model using our vb internet sales technology 
this process employs a two step bidding process 
the first step  called the preliminary bid  allows buyers to submit bids up to one hour before a real time virtual auction begins 
the second step allows buyers to bid against each other  and the high bidder from the preliminary bidding process  in a real time process over the internet 
acquisitions and new operations we have experienced significant growth in facilities as we have acquired twenty three facilities and established thirteen new facilities since the beginning of fiscal all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers  we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions  as well as the regions currently served by our facilities 
we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in north america and the uk and are able to provide national coverage for our sellers 

table of contents the following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from august  through july  locations acquisition or greenfield date geographic service area baltimore maryland greenfield november central maryland woodburn  oregon greenfield january central oregon sandy  england acquisition june east england and midlands sandtoft  england acquisition june northern england sandwich  england acquisition june london and south east england westbury  england acquisition june south wales and south west england chester  england acquisition june north wales and north west england denny  scotland acquisition june scotland wootton  england acquisition june central england punta gorda  florida greenfield july southwest florida peterlee  england acquisition august northern england wisbech  england acquisition august eastern england rochford  england acquisition august southeast england london  canada greenfield september southern ontario windsor  new jersey greenfield november central new jersey walton  kentucky greenfield january northern kentucky birmingham  alabama greenfield february central alabama inverkeithing  scotland acquisition march central scotland whitburn  scotland acquisition march central scotland featherstone  england acquisition march northeast england doncaster  england acquisition march northeast england minneapolis  minnesota greenfield march central minnesota and wisconsin sikeston  missouri acquisition march southeast missouri york  england acquisition april northern england prairie grove  arkansas greenfield july northwest arkansas louisville  kentucky greenfield september northwest kentucky and southern indiana richmond  virginia greenfield october central virginia montgomery  alabama greenfield february central alabama greer  south carolina greenfield february northwest south carolina warren  massachusetts greenfield june central massachusetts closed in fiscal former mag facility in april  we completed the acquisition of simpson bros 
york holdings limited  a uk limited liability company simpson  which operates one location in york  england 
simpson s primary business activity was the dismantling of automobiles and the sales of salvaged auto parts 
in the same month  we also completed the acquisition of bob lowe salvage pool  inc  which operates one location in sikeston  missouri 
in february  we completed the purchase of the assets and business of ag watson auto salvage motors spares scotland limited ag watson which operates two salvage locations in scotland and two salvage locations in northern england 
in august  we completed the acquisition of century salvage sales limited century  a vehicle salvage disposal company with three facilities located in the uk 
the total consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired 

table of contents on june   we acquired all the issued share capital of universal salvage plc  or universal  for per share approximately based on currency exchange rates on june  
universal  based in the uk and operating exclusively within the uk  is a service provider to the motor insurance and automotive industries 
the aggregate acquisition consideration paid by us totaled approximately million approximately million based on currency exchange rates on june  and was funded from our available cash resources 
we also assumed outstanding indebtedness of universal totaling approximately million million as of june  
the acquisition was our first acquisition outside north america and included the seven facilities discussed above 
the period to period comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions  new openings  weather and product introductions during such periods 
in particular  we have certain contracts inherited through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal  purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account 
it is our intention  where possible  to migrate these contracts to the agency model in future periods 
changes in the amount of revenue derived in a period from principal transactions relative to total revenue will impact revenue growth and margin percentages 
in addition to growth through acquisitions  we seek to increase revenues and profitability by  among other things  i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets  ii pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements  iii expanding our service offerings to sellers and buyers  and iv expanding the application of vb into new markets 
in addition  we implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures  integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel  when necessary 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated below  certain information derived from our consolidated statements of income presented in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
there can be no assurance that any trend in operating results will continue in the future 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues the following sets forth information on revenue by class in thousands  except percentages percentage of revenue percentage of revenue service revenues vehicle sales service revenues 
service revenues were approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decline of  million or  below fiscal the decline in service revenue was due to the negative impact on recorded service revenues due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate and was offset by growth in unit volume and a marginal growth in revenue per transaction 
the average dollar to pound exchange rate was dollars to the pound and dollars to the pound for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and lead to a reduction in service revenue of million 
growth in unit volume was driven primarily by an increase in the units sold on behalf of insurance companies and units sold on behalf of franchise and independent car dealerships 
the growth resulted from market wins and  with respect to insurance company cars  from what we believe to be an increase in salvage frequency 

table of contents salvage frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents that are deemed total economic losses by the insurance company 
we believe the increased availability of such cars was as a result of lower average used car pricing 
the growth in unit volume generated million in additional revenue relative to last year 
revenue yield per transaction was marginally higher as the decline in the average selling price was offset by higher yield on services provided and generated million in additional revenue compared to last year 
over of our service revenue is tied in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicles 
we believe the decline in the average selling price was primarily due to i the recent declines in commodity and used car pricing as we believe that commodity pricing  particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies  has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling  ii the decline in used car pricing because we believe used car pricing has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold to rebuilders and retailers  and iii the strengthening of the dollar as we believe a stronger dollar increases the purchase price of us vehicles paid for in our international buyers local currencies 
however  we do not have sufficient information to determine which vehicles are sold for scrap  dismantling  retailing or export and  accordingly  cannot quantify the impact that commodity pricing  used car pricing and foreign currency exchange rates had on the selling price of vehicles 
vehicle sales 
we have assumed certain contracts through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal  purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account 
vehicle sales revenues were approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decline of million  or  below fiscal the decline in vehicle sales revenue was due to the negative impact on recorded vehicle sales revenue due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate  the decline in unit volume  and the decline in revenue per transaction 
the decline in the average usd to gbp exchange rate lead to a reduction in vehicle sales revenue of million 
the decline in unit volume lead to a reduction in revenue of million and was due primarily to the migration of certain contracts in the uk from a principal basis to a fee basis 
the decline in the average revenue per transaction lead to a reduction of revenue of million 
we believe the decline in the average selling price was primarily due to i the declines in commodity pricing as we believe that commodity pricing  particularly the price per ton for crushed car bodies  has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling  ii the decline in used car pricing because we believe used car pricing has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold to rebuilders and retailers  and iii the strengthening of the dollar as we believe a stronger dollar increases the purchase price of us vehicles paid for in our international buyers local currencies 
however  we do not have sufficient information to determine which vehicles are sold for scrap  dismantling  retailing or export and  accordingly  cannot quantify the impact that commodity pricing  used car pricing and foreign currency exchange rates had on the selling price of vehicles 
yard operation expenses 
yard operation expenses were approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decline of approximately million  or  below fiscal the beneficial impact on yard operating expenses due to the change in gbp to usd exchange rate was million and was offset by an increase in the cost to process each car which was driven primarily by an increase in subhauling costs in the us and the additional costs associated with five new facilities 
included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were million and million for the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
cost of vehicle sales 
the cost of vehicles sold was approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decline of approximately million  or 
the beneficial impact on the cost of sales due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was million 
unit volume decline was responsible for million of the total decline and was due primarily to the migration of certain contracts in the uk from a principal basis to a fee 
table of contents basis 
cost per unit sold was up marginally and represented a million increase relative to last year 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or 
the beneficial impact on general and administrative expenses due to the change in gbp to usd exchange rate was approximately million 
the growth in general and administrative costs was due primarily to i increased it payroll and technology costs as we expanded our development and network departments  ii increased advertising costs as we invested in events and media promotions to generate public awareness  and iii the additional costs associated with the ceo and president s non cash compensation package approved by the shareholders in april also included in general and administrative expenses were depreciation and amortization expenses which were million and million for the years ended july  and  respectively 
other income expense 
total other income was approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decline of approximately million  or 
net interest income declined million due to reductions in both the average cash balances and the interest yield 
other income  net  declined million primarily due to the impairment of a note receivable relating to the sale of assets of the public auction business which we exited in and the loss on the sale of an airplane in the uk  together totaling million  currency exchange losses on certain intercompany obligations and losses on the disposition of other certain assets 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal and were approximately and  respectively 
the increase was driven primarily by the decline in tax exempt interest income 
discontinued operations 
during fiscal we received a million payment for a note receivable resulting from the sale of certain mag business assets and real estate 
we exited the mag business in our fiscal year 
the gain on the sale of the real estate was deferred until payment on the note receivable was received 
the million of income from discontinued operations represents that gain  net of taxes 
net income 
due to the foregoing factors  we realized net income of approximately million for fiscal  compared to net income of approximately million for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues the following sets forth information on customer revenue by geographic region based on the location of the selling entity in thousands  except percentages percentage of revenue percentage of revenue service revenues vehicle sales service revenues 
service revenues were approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  over fiscal the growth in revenue came from an increase in units sold and an increase in revenue per transaction 
the growth in units sold came from acquisitions  primarily in the uk  market share wins and the development of non insurance markets and represented million of the increase and 
table of contents service revenue yield represented million of the total increase 
growth in revenue yield per transaction was primarily due to an increase in the average selling price of the vehicles 
over of our service revenue is tied in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicles 
we believe the increase in the average selling price was due primarily to i the increases in commodity pricing  as we believe that commodity pricing  particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies  has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling  ii the increase in used car pricing  as we believe used car pricing has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold to rebuilders and retailers  iii the weakening of the dollar  as we believe a weaker dollar decreases the purchase price of us vehicles paid for in our international buyers local currencies  and iv the decline in salvaged cars sold as a percentage of total cars sold as salvaged cars generally sell for less than non salvaged cars 
however  we do not have sufficient information to determine which vehicles are sold for scrap  dismantling  retailing or export and  accordingly  cannot quantify the impact that commodity pricing  used car pricing and foreign currency exchange rates had on the selling price of vehicles 
vehicle sales 
vehicle sales revenues were approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or over fiscal the increase was due almost entirely to the uk acquisitions in which we assumed certain contracts that required us to act as a principal  purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account 
in north america we have no contracts in which we are required to purchase the vehicle from the seller 
yard operation expenses 
yard operation expenses from continuing operations were approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  over fiscal yard operating expenses in the uk  excluding depreciation  increased by million as we made our first acquisition in our fourth quarter of fiscal and  accordingly  had a full year of expenses in fiscal in north america  excluding depreciation  yard operating expenses grew by million due primarily to increased volume 
included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which grew by million to million due primarily to increased amortization associated with intangible assets acquired in the uk 
cost of vehicles sales 
the cost of vehicles sold was approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  over fiscal the increase was due primarily to the uk acquisitions in which we assume certain contracts that require us to act as a principal  purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were approximately million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal the increase came primarily from the additional management  finance  technology  systems and administrative resources required to support international operations  increased resources required to accelerate the development and deployment of the enhancements to vb and to our seller support software and interfaces  and the incremental costs associated with the uk integration 
included in general and administrative expenses is depreciation and amortization of million  an increase of million over fiscal and includes amortization expenses relating to intangible assets acquired as part of the uk acquisitions 
other income 
total other income was approximately million during fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  a decline of approximately million  or  over fiscal interest income declined million due to lower interest rates and a lower average cash and investment balance 
net other income increased approximately million 
equity in loss 
table of contents of unconsolidated entity reflected a million write down  in fiscal  to the carrying value of our investment in lanelogic corporation lanelogic 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal and were approximately and  respectively 
net income 
due to the foregoing factors  we realized net income of approximately million for fiscal  compared to net income of approximately million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our primary source of working capital is cash generated though operations 
potential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of equity through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
a potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of debt and equity 
however  with respect to the issuance of equity or debt  we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future and  if available  if they can be issued under terms commercially acceptable to us 
historically  we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations  public offerings of common stock  the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing 
our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection on sellers fees  buyers fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of auctioned salvage vehicles 
our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and  consequently  the number of cars totaled by the insurance companies 
during the winter months  most of our facilities process to more vehicles than at other times of the year 
this increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 
because our primary source of working capital is net income  factors affecting net income are the principal factors affecting the generation of working capital 
those primary factors i seasonality  ii market wins and losses  iii supplier mix  iv accident frequency  v salvage frequency  vi change in market share of our existing suppliers  vii commodity pricing  viii used car pricing  ix foreign currency exchanges rates  x product mix  and xi contract mix to the extent appropriate  are discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections in this form k 
as of july   we had working capital of approximately million  including cash  and cash equivalents of approximately million 
cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts  which bear interest at a variable rate 
cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million from fiscal to fiscal we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if we experience significant growth in the future  we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million to million during fiscal when compared to fiscal the increase was driven primarily by a reduction in income taxes receivable of million which was offset by a decrease in net income of million 
the remaining increase of million is due to routine changes in working capital items 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million to million during fiscal when compared to fiscal  due to the increase in net income which was offset in part by the timing of routine changes in working capital items 
the increase in net income is primarily the result of increased revenue in fiscal 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million to million during fiscal when compared to fiscal  due to the increase in net income which was offset in part to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 
the increase in net income is primarily the result of increased revenue in fiscal and the loss on discontinued operations in the amount of million in fiscal  which did not recur in fiscal investing activities during the fiscal years ended july  and  we purchased approximately million and million  respectively  of short term investments  which were offset by the sale of million and million  respectively  of short term investments 
we historically invested our cash in auction rate notes with ratings of aaa 
by the end of the first quarter of fiscal  we converted our entire balance of short term investments to cash and cash equivalents 
capital expenditures related to continuing operations excluding those associated with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures are primarily related to opening and improving facilities and acquiring yard equipment 
we continue to expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations 
we have no material commitments for future capital expenditures as of july  during the fiscal year ended july   we used approximately million in cash for the acquisitions of century salvage sales limited  simpson bros 
york  ltd  ag watson auto salvage and motor spares scotland limited  and bob lowe s salvage pool 
during the fiscal year ended july   we used approximately million in cash for the acquisition of universal which includes the following seven locations in the uk sandy  sandtoft  sandwich  westbury  chester  denny  and wootton

the repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
no time limit has been placed on the duration of the share repurchase program 
subject to applicable securities laws  such repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate and may be discontinued at any time

we remitted approximately million to the proper taxing authorities in satisfaction of the employee s minimum statutory withholding requirements 
the tax withholding amounts paid by us have been accounted for as a repurchase of shares in the shareholders equity section in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
however  these deemed share repurchases are not included as part of our stock repurchase program described in the preceding paragraph 
contractual obligations we lease certain domestic and foreign facilities  and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
in addition to the minimum future lease commitments presented  the leases generally require the company to pay property taxes  insurance  maintenance and repair costs which are not included in the table because we have determined these items are not material 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years other operating leases capital leases tax liabilities total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration per period commercial commitments total less than year years years more than years other letters of credit contractual obligations consist of future non cancelable minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases  used in the normal course of business 
tax liabilities include the long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions 
at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
commercial commitments consist primarily of letters of credit provided for insurance programs and certain business transactions 
credit facilities on march   we entered into an unsecured credit agreement with bank of america  na the credit agreement providing for a million reduced from million pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement revolving credit facility the credit facility  including a million foreign currency borrowing sublimit and a million letter of credit sublimit 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility may be used for repurchases of stock  capital expenditures  working capital

the credit facility matures  and all outstanding borrowings are due  on the fifth anniversary of the credit agreement  with annual reductions in availability of million on each of the first three anniversaries of the credit agreement 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility may be repaid and re borrowed until the maturity date and bear interest  at our option  at either eurocurrency rate plus to  depending of the leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement  at the end of the previous quarter or at the prime rate 
a default interest rate applies on all obligations during an event of default under the credit facility at a rate per annum equal to above the otherwise applicable interest rate 
the credit facility requires us to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the commitment fee ranges from to depending on the leverage ratio as of the end on the previous quarter 
the credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and places certain business operating restrictions on us relating to  among other things  indebtedness  liens and other encumbrances  investments  mergers and acquisitions  asset sales  and dividends  distributions and redemptions of capital stock 
in addition  the credit agreement provides for a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to vehicle pooling costs  self insured reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  revenue recognition  share based compensation  long lived asset impairment calculations and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates included in our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
where appropriate  we discuss sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur 

table of contents revenue recognition we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer 
these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery  loading  title processing  preparation and storage 
we evaluate multiple element arrangements relative to our buyer and seller agreements in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  which addresses accounting for multiple element arrangements  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which addresses revenue recognition for units of accounting 
the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller s behalf and  under most of our current north american contracts  collecting the proceeds from the buyer 
we are not entitled to any such seller fees until we have collected the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller and  accordingly  we recognize revenue for seller services after service delivery and cash collection 
vehicle sales  where we purchase and remarket vehicles on our own behalf  are recognized in accordance with sab on the sale date  which is typically the point of high bid acceptance 
upon high bid acceptance  a legal binding contract is formed with the buyer  and we record the gross sales price as revenue 
in certain cases  seller fees are not contingent upon collection of the seller proceeds from the buyer 
however  we determined that we are not able to separate the services into separate units of accounting because we do not have fair value for undelivered items 
as a result  we do not recognize seller fees until the final seller service has been delivered  which generally occurs upon collection of the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller 
we provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle  charging a separate fee for each service 
each of these services has been assessed under the criteria of eitf to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multi element arrangement 
we have concluded that the sale and the post sale services are separate units of accounting 
the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale  and the fees for the post sale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the residual method 
we also charge buyers an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program  which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  and relist and late payment fees  which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the buyer 
no provision for returns has been established  as all sales are final with no right of return  although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of non performance by our buyers or sellers 
vehicle pooling costs we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us  but not sold as of the balance sheet date 
we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period  the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period 
the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs  labor  transportation  and vehicle processing 
if our allocation factors change  then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future 
these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost basis 
given the fixed cost nature of our business there is not a direct correlation in an increase in expenses or units processed on vehicle pooling costs 

table of contents we apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  no 
 inventory costs sfas  to our vehicle pooling costs 
sfas requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of so abnormal as provided in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
in addition  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to sellers or buyers and the inability of our sellers or buyers to make required payments 
if billing disputes exceed expectations and or if the financial condition of our sellers or buyers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance is calculated by taking both seller and buyer accounts receivables written off during the previous month period as a percentage of the total accounts receivable balance  ie total write offs total accounts receivable write off percentage 
we note that a one percentage point deviation in the write off percentage would have resulted in an increase or decrease to the allowance for doubtful accounts balance of less than million 
valuation of goodwill we evaluate the impairment of goodwill of our north america and uk operating segments annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating segments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 
income taxes and deferred tax assets we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no  accounting for income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us  canada and uk 
in arriving at a provision of income taxes  we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate  we then analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities  such as various accruals  depreciation and amortization 
the tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the probability that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our ability to generate future taxable income 
in the event that it is more likely than not the full benefit would not be realized from the deferred tax assets we carry on our consolidated balance sheet  we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
as of july   we had approximately million of valuation allowance arising from the net operating losses in states where we had discontinued certain operations in prior years 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated income statement 
historically  our income taxes have been sufficiently provided to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate 
nonetheless  our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by the following factors  including i the geographical allocation of our future earnings  ii the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws  iii the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles  iv the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and v the outcome of the income tax examinations 
as a result  we routinely 
table of contents assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision 
based on our results for the twelve months ended july   a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately million 
effective august   we adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest settlement of any particular position  could require the use of cash 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by various taxing authorities  including the internal revenue service and us states 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
long lived asset valuation  including intangible assets we evaluate long lived assets  including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future  we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based awards to employees and non employees using the fair value method as required by sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost related to share based payment transactions  measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued  be recognized in the financial statements 
determining the fair value of options using the black scholes model  or other currently accepted option valuation models  requires highly subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise  which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the grant date 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions  we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense  which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

table of contents retained insurance liabilities we are partially self insured for certain losses related to medical  general liability  workers compensation and auto liability 
our insurance policies are subject to a  deductible per claim  with the exception of our medical policy which is  per claim 
in addition  each of our policies contains an aggregate stop loss which limits our ultimate exposure 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates 
the primary estimates used in the actuarial analysis include total payroll and revenue 
our estimates have not materially fluctuated from actual results 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation  differ from our estimates  our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be impacted 
the process of determining our insurance reserves requires estimates with various assumptions  each of which can positively or negatively impact those balances 
the total amount reserved for all policies is approximately million as of july  if the total number of participants in the medical plan changed by we estimate that our medical expense would change by approximately million and our medical accrual would change by approximately  if our total payroll changed by we estimate that our workers compensation expense would change by approximately  and our accrual for workers compensation expenses would change by  a change in revenue would change our insurance premium for the general liability and umbrella policy by less than segment reporting our north american and uk regions are considered two separate operating segments  which have been aggregated into one reportable segment because they share similar economic characteristics 
recently issued accounting standards for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and translation risk 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets  as of july   all of our total cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits and money market funds 
as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable  a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows  but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments 
as of july   we held no direct investments in auction rate securities  collateralized debt obligations  structured investment vehicles or mortgaged backed securities 
based on the average cash balance held during the twelve months ended july   a change in our interest yield would not materially affect our operating results 
we do not hedge interest rate fluctuation risks 

table of contents foreign currency and translation exposure fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries 
international net revenues result from transactions by our canadian and uk operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency  the canadian dollar and the british pound 
our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar and british pound in which our revenues and profits are denominated would result in a decrease increase to revenue of approximately million for the twelve months ended july  there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented  due primarily to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise  which may positively or negatively affect income 
fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period 
at july   the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss of approximately million 
this loss is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
a strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar or the british pound will not have a material affect on our consolidated financial position 
we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
