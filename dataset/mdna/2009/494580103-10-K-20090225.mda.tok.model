item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the selected financial data in item and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
all financial and operating data presented in items and reflects the continuing operations of our business for all periods presented unless otherwise indicated 
overview we are a healthcare services company that through our subsidiaries operates hospitals  nursing centers and a contract rehabilitation services business across the united states 
at december   our hospital division operated ltac hospitals with  licensed beds in states 
our health services division operated nursing centers with  licensed beds in states 
we also operated a contract rehabilitation services business which provides rehabilitative services primarily in long term care settings 
on july   we completed the spin off transaction 
see item business general spin off transaction and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in recent years  we have completed several strategic divestitures to improve our future operating results 
for accounting purposes  the operating results of these businesses and the losses or impairments associated with these transactions have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented 
assets not sold at december  have been measured at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less costs of disposal and have been classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the operating results of acquired businesses have been included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements from the respective acquisition dates 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we have agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to each of our operating divisions 
these payment arrangements may be based upon prospective rates  reimbursable costs  established charges  discounted charges or per diem payments 
net patient service revenue is recorded at the estimated net realizable amounts from medicare  medicaid  other third party payors and individual patients for services rendered 
retroactive adjustments that are likely to result from future examinations by third party payors are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted as necessary in future periods based upon new information or final settlements 
we recorded income of approximately million in related to the favorable settlement of a prior year nursing center medicaid cost report dispute 
favorable settlements of prior year hospital medicare cost reports aggregated million in and million in 
table of contents during  we also recorded a pretax credit of approximately million to reflect a change in estimate for hospital medicare in house accounts receivable and a pretax credit of approximately million to adjust certain nursing center medicaid revenues 
a summary of revenues by payor type follows in thousands year ended december  medicare medicaid other third parties eliminations rehabilitation pharmacy collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from the medicare and medicaid programs  other government programs  managed care health plans  commercial insurance companies and individual patients and customers 
estimated provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including the age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the composition of patient accounts by payor type  the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors and general industry conditions 
actual collections of accounts receivable in subsequent periods may require changes in the estimated provision for loss 
changes in these estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of the change 
the provision for doubtful accounts totaled million for  million for and million for during  we recorded a million charge related to accounts receivable for certain hospitals acquired in allowances for insurance risks we insure a substantial portion of our professional liability risks and workers compensation risks through a wholly owned limited purpose insurance subsidiary 
provisions for loss for these risks are based upon management s best available information including actuarially determined estimates 
the allowance for professional liability risks includes an estimate of the expected cost to settle reported claims and an amount  based upon past experiences  for losses incurred but not reported 
these liabilities are necessarily based upon estimates and  while management believes that the provision for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of  or less than  the amounts recorded 
to the extent that expected ultimate claims costs vary from historical provisions for loss  future earnings will be charged or credited 
provisions for loss for professional liability risks retained by our limited purpose insurance subsidiary have been discounted based upon actuarial estimates of claim payment patterns using a discount rate of for the policy year and for all prior policy years 
amounts equal to the discounted loss provision are funded 
table of contents annually 
we do not fund the portion of professional liability risks related to estimated claims that have been incurred but not reported 
accordingly  these liabilities are not discounted 
the allowance for professional liability risks aggregated million at december  and million at december  if we did not discount any of the allowances for professional liability risks  these balances would have approximated million at december  and million at december  as a result of improved professional liability underwriting results of our limited purpose insurance subsidiary  we received distributions of million in  million in and million in from our limited purpose insurance subsidiary 
these distributions had no impact on earnings 
changes in the number of professional liability claims and the cost to settle these claims significantly impact the allowance for professional liability risks 
a relatively small variance between our estimated and actual number of claims or average cost per claim could have a material impact  either favorable or unfavorable  on the adequacy of the allowance for professional liability risks 
for example  a variance in the allowance for professional liability risks at december  would impact our operating income by approximately million 
the provision for professional liability risks continuing operations  including the cost of coverage maintained with unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers  aggregated million for  million for and million for changes in estimates for prior year professional liability costs reduced professional liability costs by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
while we expect that professional liability costs for may be higher than the costs recorded over the last three years  we believe that our professional liability costs appear to be moderating 
with respect to our discontinued operations  we recorded a favorable pretax adjustment of million in  a pretax charge aggregating million in and a favorable pretax adjustment of million in resulting from changes in estimates for professional liability reserves related to prior years 
provisions for loss for workers compensation risks retained by our limited purpose insurance subsidiary are not discounted and amounts equal to the loss provision are funded annually 
the allowance for workers compensation risks aggregated million at december  and million at december  the provision for workers compensation risks continuing operations  including the cost of coverage maintained with unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers  aggregated million for  million for and million for see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon our estimate of annual taxable income or loss for each respective accounting period 
we recognize an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
these temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating and capital loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided for these deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in  we reached a settlement with the irs related to all disputed federal income tax issues for fiscal and in connection with the settlement  we paid approximately million of employer payroll taxes to the irs in because of fresh start accounting rules related to our reorganization in  the settlement of these pre reorganization income tax matters had no impact on earnings in 
table of contents our effective income tax rate was in  in and in the effective income tax rate in was negatively impacted by million of non deductible expenses associated with the spin off transaction 
we recorded favorable income tax adjustments related to the resolution of certain income tax contingencies from prior years that reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately million in each of and  and million in in july  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
there are significant uncertainties with respect to capital loss carryforwards that could affect materially the realization of certain deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we have recognized deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not they will be realized and a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets to the extent that it is uncertain that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we recognized net deferred tax assets totaling million at december  and million at december  after our emergence from bankruptcy  the realization of pre reorganization deferred tax assets and the resolution of certain income tax contingencies eliminated in full the goodwill recorded in connection with fresh start accounting 
after the fresh start accounting goodwill was eliminated in full  the excess of approximately million in  million in and million in was treated as an increase to capital in excess of par value and a reduction in the pre emergence deferred tax valuation allowance and pre emergence income tax liability 
following the effective date of sfas r as defined  adjustments to pre emergence unrecognized income tax benefits of million will be recorded to earnings 
we are subject to various federal and state income tax audits in the ordinary course of business 
such audits could result in increased tax payments  interest and penalties 
while we believe our tax positions are appropriate  we cannot assure you that the various authorities engaged in the examination of our income tax returns will not challenge our positions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we regularly review the carrying value of certain long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate an impairment or an adjustment to the amortization period is necessary 
if circumstances suggest that the recorded amounts cannot be recovered based upon estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value 
in assessing the carrying values of long lived assets  we estimate future cash flows at the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
for this purpose  these cash flows are aggregated based upon the contractual agreements underlying the operation of the facility or group of facilities 
generally  an individual facility is considered the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
however  to the extent that groups of facilities are leased under a master lease agreement in which the operations of a facility and compliance with the lease terms are interdependent upon other facilities in the agreement including our ability to renew the lease or divest a particular property  we define the group of facilities under a master lease agreement as the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
accordingly  the estimated cash flows of all facilities within a master lease agreement are aggregated for purposes of evaluating the carrying values of long lived assets 
our other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized under sfas no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to five years 

table of contents in accordance with sfas  we are required to perform an impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually or more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
also  in the fourth quarter of  the market value of our common stock declined significantly below book equity value 
the decline was generally attributable to our announcement of weaker than expected third quarter operating results particularly in our hospital division and the related reduction in our earnings outlook for the fourth quarter of and fiscal as compared with investor expectations 
in addition  the deterioration in the debt and equity markets resulting from weak global economic conditions also may have contributed to the decline in the market value of our common stock 
the significant difference between book equity value and the market value of our common stock at december  was an indication that the carrying value of our goodwill may have been impaired 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test at the end of each fiscal year for each of our reporting units 
a reporting unit is either an operating segment or one level below the operating segment  referred to as a component 
because the components within our operating segments have similar economic characteristics  we aggregate the components of our operating segments into one reporting unit 
accordingly  we have determined that our reporting units are hospitals  nursing centers  and rehabilitation services 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
based upon the results of the step one impairment test for goodwill and the impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets in each of the last three years  no impairment charges were recorded in connection with our annual impairment tests 
since quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  we applied judgment in determining the fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test 
we relied on widely accepted valuation techniques  including equally weighted discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses approaches  which capture both the future income potential of the reporting unit and the market behaviors and actions of market participants in the industry that includes the reporting unit 
these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows  industry specific economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
the discounted cash flow approach uses a projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital 
under the discounted cash flow approach  the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in the number of admissions  patient days  reimbursement rates  operating costs  rent expense and capital expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  changes in working capital requirements and weighted average cost of capital 
the market multiple analysis estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit s operating results 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics to the reporting units 
our analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its book equity value 
our conclusions were supported by both quantitative and qualitative factors  including the estimate of an implied control premium for acquisitions in our industry  the significant improvements in our fourth quarter operating results and consideration of our updated business expectations 
these results significantly exceeded both our third quarter results and fourth quarter expectations particularly in our hospital division and represent information not available to investors in determining the market value of our common stock at december  we performed sensitivity analyses on our estimated fair value for each of our reporting units 
two key assumptions in our fair value estimate are the weighted average cost of capital used for discounting our cash flow estimates and the market multiple applied to operating performance 
at december   the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value  and the excess approximated million for hospitals  
table of contents million for nursing centers and million for rehabilitation services 
we noted that an increase of basis points in the weighted average cost of capital would decrease the fair value by approximately million for hospitals  million for nursing centers and million for rehabilitation services  and would not result in an impairment of goodwill attributable to any of the reporting units 
a decrease of basis points in the market multiple applied to operating results would decrease the fair value by approximately million for hospitals  million for nursing centers and million for rehabilitation services  and would not result in an impairment of goodwill attributable to any of the reporting units 
the fair values of our indefinite lived intangible assets  primarily hospital certificates of need  are estimated using an excess earnings method  a form of discounted cash flow  which is based upon the concept that net after tax cash flows provide a return supporting all of the assets of a business operation 
the fair values of our indefinite lived intangible assets are derived from projections which include management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in the number of admissions  patient days  reimbursement rates  operating costs  rent expense and capital expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  changes in working capital requirements and weighted average cost of capital 
at december   the fair value of our hospital certificates of need intangible assets exceeded its carrying value by approximately million 
we noted that an increase of basis points in the weighted average cost of capital would decrease the fair value by approximately million  and would not result in an impairment of the hospital certificates of need intangible assets 
although we have determined that there was no goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible asset impairments as of december   continued declines in the value of our common stock or adverse changes in the operating environment and related key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets may result in future impairment charges for a portion or all of these assets 
an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations  but would not be expected to have an impact on our cash flows or liquidity 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb staff position emerging issues task force eitf eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities  which clarifies that share based payment awards that entitle the holder to receive nonforfeitable dividends before vesting would be considered participating securities 
as participating securities  these instruments should be included in the calculation of basic earnings per common share 
the provisions of eitf will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material impact on our earnings per common share calculation 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  business combinations  which significantly changes the accounting for business combinations  including  among other changes  new accounting concepts in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired  recording the fair value of contingent considerations and contingencies at the acquisition date and expensing acquisition and restructuring costs 
sfas r will be applied prospectively and is effective for business combinations which occur during fiscal years beginning after december  we cannot determine the impact that sfas r will have on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
however  any business combination entered into after the adoption may significantly impact our financial position and results of operations when compared to acquisitions accounted for under previous generally accepted accounting principles and may result in more earnings volatility and generally lower earnings due to the expensing of acquisition costs and restructuring costs 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests 
sfas will recharacterize minority interests as noncontrolling interests and they will be classified as a 
table of contents component of stockholders equity 
the new consolidation method will significantly change the accounting for transactions with minority interest holders 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas no 
sfas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which deferred the effective date of sfas for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
accordingly  we deferred the adoption of sfas until january the provisions of sfas apply to assets and liabilities  including investments  loans and transfers including sales and securitizations of financial assets  derivatives  financial liabilities  and other various financial assets and liabilities 
the adoption of sfas did not  and sfas is not expected to  have a material impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas no 
sfas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  which clarifies the application of sfas and provides key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
sfas is effective upon issuance and did not have a material impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
impact of medicare and medicaid reimbursement we depend on reimbursement from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs  for substantially all of our revenues 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our total revenues before eliminations from the medicare and medicaid programs and the balance from other third party payors  such as commercial insurance companies  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and contracted providers 
the medicare and medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes

table of contents the year in review we achieved success on a number of fronts in despite a difficult economic environment 
more importantly  fiscal provided further evidence to support our fundamental management philosophy if we take care of our people and focus on quality and customer service  our business results will follow 
financial highlights for the year include we reported solid revenue gains in each of our three operating divisions in excluding our former pharmacy division that was spun off in july  our consolidated revenues of billion grew a solid  diluted earnings per share from continuing operations totaled  significantly better than our expectations at the beginning of the year  routine and hospital development capital spending totaled million in  all of which was financed through internal sources  operating cash flows for grew to million  cash levels at december  increased to million  providing significant financial flexibility in a generally difficult credit environment  and the remaining unborrowed capacity under our revolving credit facility totaled million at the end of the year 
the credit facility  with its favorable pricing  financial covenants and other terms  is scheduled to expire in july our hospital division maintained strong admissions growth during with particularly solid growth in non government admissions 
we have dedicated more resources to educating referral sources on the quality  capabilities and cost effectiveness of our services 
these efforts have led to increased medicare admissions and further penetration into the managed care market 
despite the positive admissions growth  declining length of stay  cost management issues and weakness in certain newer facilities negatively impacted our hospital operating results for as we move into  we have renewed our efforts to better control variable costs and are leveraging our management resources to improve the operations of our underperforming hospitals 
in our health services division  reimbursement rate increases  growth in managed care volumes and reductions in professional liability costs resulted in better operating results in our investments in clinical resources at the operating level have improved overall admissions and the mix of medicare and managed care patients as well 
our overall admissions growth was strong in  which improved our occupancy to from in in addition  our quality investments in staffing  training and physical plant continue to enhance our capabilities to serve higher acuity patients and residents 
peoplefirst rehabilitation continued its growth beyond the kindred portfolio of hospitals and nursing centers by signing new contracts with non affiliated customers 
in  approximately of our peoplefirst revenues were derived from non affiliated customers  up from in further growth in volumes and revenues helped to offset declines in our operating margins from wage rate pressures associated with an increasingly competitive marketplace for therapists and the start up costs associated with non affiliated customer contract growth 
we also have made great progress over the past few years in the recruitment  retention and development of our people 
our investments in employee orientation  continuing clinical education  leadership development and employee recognition programs have helped to make kindred an employer of choice in many of our local markets 
our employee turnover percentages  a leading indicator in our businesses  have consistently improved in each of the last five years 

table of contents our commitment to our employees is the key driver in our ongoing efforts to improve clinical quality and customer service 
during  improvements in the quality of our services were evidenced by the following accomplishments our nursing centers received quality awards from the american health care association  the key quality metrics in our hospital division ventilator pneumonia and blood stream infection rates improved and continued to exceed national benchmarks  and peoplefirst rehabilitation therapists achieved additional improvements in the functional outcomes of over  patients discharged from our care 
as a provider of healthcare services  we are ever aware of the continued rise in the cost of providing quality healthcare 
in that regard  we have taken the following measures that demonstrate our continued commitment to cost effective  quality patient care we successfully renegotiated our pharmacy services agreement with pharmerica resulting in anticipated cost reductions of approximately million per year during and  we continued to improve our professional liability underwriting results  reducing aggregate expenses by approximately million from  and we continued to use technology  such as the rollout of hand held devices for our peoplefirst rehabilitation therapists  to improve productivity  reduce costs and improve patient safety 
despite the turmoil in the financial markets  we remain committed to growing and repositioning our operations to capture new opportunities and we believe further opportunities exist for the expansion of our services 
during  we continued to execute our strategic development plan as reflected by the following we opened a new hospital with licensed beds  we have five hospitals containing licensed hospital beds currently under development  one of which will become operational in and the remainder in  and we further repositioned our hospital portfolio by divesting three underperforming ltac hospitals 
we expect that the general economic environment will be difficult in we also anticipate that healthcare reform will be a central focus of lawmakers at both the federal and state levels 
as one of the largest providers of post acute care services  we intend to be actively engaged in those discussions and believe that we are adapting our operations to address the needs of patients and their families as well as the concerns of federal and state policy makers and other third party payors 
our focus on the quality of care provided to our patients and residents  our commitment to taking care of our employees and our efforts to effectively use and preserve our capital resources have positioned us well for the future 
we are in position to efficiently respond to a challenging economic  political and regulatory landscape in order to deliver high quality care to our patients and residents  produce a valuable work experience for our employees and provide profitability for our shareholders 
hospital division revenues increased in to billion and in to billion 
during each of the past two years  revenues have grown through increases in same store volumes  expansion of services and ongoing development of new hospitals

other information effects of inflation and changing prices we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs 
congress and certain state legislatures have enacted or may enact additional significant cost containment measures limiting our ability to recover our cost increases through increased pricing of our healthcare services 
medicare revenues in ltac hospitals and nursing centers are subject to fixed payments under the medicare prospective payment systems 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many states in which we operate nursing centers also are based upon fixed payment systems 
generally  these rates are adjusted annually for inflation 
however  these adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in the costs of providing healthcare services 
we believe that our operating margins may continue to be under pressure as the growth in operating expenses  particularly professional liability  labor and employee benefits costs  exceeds payment increases from third party payors 
in addition  as a result of competitive pressures  our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private patients is limited 
see part i item business governmental regulation for a detailed discussion of medicare and medicaid reimbursement regulations
