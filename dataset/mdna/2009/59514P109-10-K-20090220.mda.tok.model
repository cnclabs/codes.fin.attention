technology  intellectual property and research and development we were founded in on a commitment to rf ic innovation 
we have an established track record of introducing advanced products  based on our pioneering rf ic technology  that address emerging markets and serve customers in existing markets 
as of december   we had technical personnel 
our technical team represents one of our most important strategic and competitive assets 
our team  comprised of rf  analog and digital ic  systems  and product and test engineers and technicians  enables us to produce differentiated rf ic and subsystem module solutions for applications in our targeted markets 
team members are located in our design centers in plano  texas  plantation  florida  boulder  colorado and ingolstadt  germany 
we believe we have a strong intellectual property portfolio  which is of vital importance to our business as many of our competitors are larger  more diversified companies with substantially greater financial resources 
our ability to protect our proprietary innovations from exploitation by our competitors is crucial to our future success 
we have in the past and will continue to vigorously pursue and maintain protection for the proprietary technology used in our products 
currently  we hold issued united states utility patents and have more than additional united states patent applications pending 
our issued united states patents begin to expire in our patents generally cover various aspects of our rf and analog technologies at the broad architectural  circuit and building block levels 
see part iv  item  exhibits  financial statement schedules for our patent license agreement with broadcom corporation 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
of these amounts  stock based compensation expense comprised million  million and million  respectively

our sales organization consists of technical sales  service and customer support professionals and includes a field application engineering staff that is involved with customers during various phases of design and production 
the field applications engineering function  located throughout our worldwide sales offices  is a critical element in achieving customer design wins 
we also provide customers with application engineering support from our systems engineering personnel based in plano and ingolstadt 
we centralize and manage sales for all of our products across each of our target markets under one worldwide sales organization 
we primarily sell our products directly to our customers and to a lesser extent via a network of distributors and independent sales representatives located around the world 
historically  revenues from international markets have represented the majority of our total revenues 
see item a  risk factors for a description of this risk and other risks 
see note  geographic information and significant customers to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of financial information by geographic area 
backlog our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products 
industry fluctuations in the supply and demand balance for component parts result in frequent and potentially significant changes in the lead times provided by our customers when placing purchase orders 
although our backlog at the beginning of a quarter represents a significant portion of the net revenue we anticipate for that quarter  we do not believe that backlog is a reliable indicator of future revenue levels 
customers we market and sell our ics and subsystem module solutions directly to oems  odms and their suppliers who sell devices or applications to consumers  other oems or service providers cable within the cable  dtv and automotive entertainment electronics markets 
the devices or applications that our customers produce include cable television set top boxes  docsis based  high speed voice and data cable modems  car audio  television and antenna amplifier systems  digital analog television systems  including hdtv  pc tv multimedia products  and mobile television receivers

table of contents manufacturing we use subcontractors for ic wafer production  die packaging and testing 
this allows us to eliminate the high capital requirements of owning and operating semiconductor fabrication  packaging and test facilities 
it also enables us to focus on the design of our ic products as well as providing engineering support to our customers  where we believe we have the best opportunity to create and maintain competitive advantage 
we have established relations with ic wafer foundries  ibm  jazz semiconductor a tower group company and x fab  to help ensure our future demands are in line with their manufacturing technology roadmaps and capacities 
these foundries offer a mature bicmos production process 
in addition  ibm and jazz semiconductor offer advanced silicon germanium sige process technology 
our reliance on third party suppliers involves risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and fabrication costs and the risk of material supply disruptions

competition the semiconductor industry  in general  and the markets in which we compete  in particular  are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  increasing degrees of component integration  evolving industry standards and price erosion 
many of our competitors are larger  more diversified companies with substantially greater financial resources 
some of our competitors are also customers who have internal ic and rf subsystems design and manufacturing capability 
we also compete with smaller  emerging companies whose strategy is to sell products into specialized markets or to provide a portion of the products or product capabilities that we offer 
we expect competition to continue to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter our markets 
although the specific basis on which we compete varies by market  we believe that the principal factors common to all our markets are conformity to industry standards  performance improvements  price reductions  differentiating product features  time to market for new products

risk factors 
our success depends on the growth of the cable  automotive entertainment electronics and dtv markets generally  the demand for rf products within these markets specifically and the success of our customers 
we derive our revenue from sales of rf products into cable  automotive entertainment electronics and dtv applications or devices within the cable  automotive entertainment electronics and dtv markets 
these markets are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  long design cycles  and short product life cycles  especially in the pc and consumer electronics markets 

table of contents the cable  automotive entertainment electronics and dtv markets may not grow in the future as anticipated or a significant market slowdown may occur 
further  demand for applications or devices that include our products or are targeted by our products  in particular  cable set top boxes  high speed voice and data cable modems  car audio  video and antenna amplifier systems  digital analog televisions  including high definition televisions  pc tv multimedia products and mobile televisions may not grow at a rate sufficient for us to sustain profitability  or our customers market share may decline  even though demand in general is high  which would also adversely affect our financial results 
because of the intense competition in the cable  automotive entertainment electronics and dtv markets  the unproven technology of many products addressing these markets and the short product life cycles of many consumer applications and devices  it is difficult to predict the potential size and future growth rate of the markets for our rf products 
in addition  the cable  automotive entertainment electronics and dtv markets are transitioning from analog to digital standards  as well as expanding to new services  such as interactive television  portable or mobile television and on demand services 
the future growth of our rf product markets is dependent upon market acceptance of our customers applications and devices that incorporate our rf technology and address the cable  automotive entertainment electronics and dtv markets  and we cannot assure you that our customers products and consequently  our underlying rf technology  will be accepted by any of the end customers in these markets 
if the demand for our rf products is not as great as we expect  if we are unable to produce competitive products to meet that demand or if we are otherwise unable to capitalize on market opportunities  we may not be able to generate revenue growth or profitability 
the current economic slowdown will have a negative impact on our business  potentially resulting in significant operating losses and a decrease in our net cash position 
cost control activities may not be as successful as planned and reduced product development and customer design activity levels could result in decreased long term business prospects 
the current economic slowdown is affecting all of our target markets and it is difficult to estimate the duration and significance of the slowdown and the resulting negative impact on our business 
our ability to manage expenses to a level commensurate with reduced business levels is difficult given our reduced visibility and the fixed nature of certain expense categories 
furthermore  due to the vital importance of research and development activities to our future product development  it could be difficult to reduce our research and development spending materially without jeopardizing our current position as an rf tuner technology leader 
consequently  our efforts to control and reduce expenses may not be enough to maintain profitability  and we may incur significant operating losses and use a portion of our cash reserves 
the negative impact on operating results may preclude us from paying cash incentive compensation which could negatively affect employee morale 
we may also see a continued negative impact on our stock price  significantly reducing or eliminating the financial benefit of long term equity incentives  which could also negatively affect employee morale and impact our efforts at employee retention 
we are dependent on american international group aig  our former d o insurance carrier  for the reimbursement of certain ongoing and substantial legal expenses incurred by certain former officers of the company who are involved in litigation with the sec related to its investigation into our historical stock option granting practices 
should aig stop paying our claims for these expenses  our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
recently  aig has experienced significant financial issues associated with the troubled credit markets  and has received financial support from the us government 
it is unclear whether the restructuring of aig will cause aig to alter its coverage position or reimbursement policies 
at december   we expected reimbursement of approximately million of legal expenses 
the failure of aig to continue making reimbursements to us under our d o insurance policy could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
through december   we have received cumulative reimbursements of million 

table of contents we depend on several significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue 
if we lose business from a significant customer  or if any of our significant customers lose market share in the markets in which they compete  our results would be significantly adversely affected 
we have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to a relatively small number of significant customers and we expect this trend to continue 
the loss of any significant customer would significantly harm our revenue 
net revenue from customers  including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors  exceeding of net revenue was as follows year ended december  cisco unihan panasonic ten largest customers primarily for the benefit of arris group  inc a wholly owned subsidiary of asustek computer less than of total net revenue in light of the current economic crisis  our significant customers may curtail certain research and development spending which could impact the deployment of our latest generation rf products  which are designed to replace older technology products 
a decision by any of our significant customers to curtail certain research and development spending could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and future prospects 
further  several existing and potential customers have substantial internal technological capabilities and could develop products internally that compete with or replace our products 
a decision by any of our significant customers to internally design and manufacture products that compete with our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and future prospects 
we believe that our future results of operations will continue to depend on the success of our significant customers  on our ability to sell existing and new products to these customers in significant quantities and without significant price erosion and on our ability to diversify our customer base 
to attract new customers or retain existing customers  we may offer certain customers very attractive prices on our products  which could impact our overall pricing strategy 
in that event  our average selling prices and gross margins would decline 
the current economic crisis could cause our customers to ask for greater pricing concessions 
the loss of a significant customer  a reduction in sales to any significant customer or a significant decrease in our sales prices made to retain a significant customer would adversely impact our revenue and consequently our results of operations and financial condition 
we generate the vast majority of our net revenue and income from the cable market 
market specific risks affecting the cable market could result in significantly decreased net revenue and income 
we face significant competition from other module and silicon tuner suppliers as we compete for business with certain key set top box and high speed cable modem manufacturers 
protecting our share of this market and our ability to capture future growth opportunities in this market will depend on our ability to develop products that anticipate the needs of our customers  develop products in the timeframes required by our customers  and develop products at a cost that is attractive to our customers 
if we are not successful  we may lose share in this market  or potentially lose a significant customer  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our customers in the cable market face significant competition from other set top box and high speed cable modem manufacturers as they target the business of key cable service providers on a global basis 
we also rely on our customers ability to develop products that meet the needs of the cable service providers  in terms of functionality  performance  availability and price 
if our customers do not successfully compete  they may lose market share  which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
cable service providers are facing significant competition from communications carriers including  in many cases  traditional telecommunications companies and satellite service providers as they compete for customers in terms of video  voice and data services 
we are also dependent on the ability of the cable service providers to effectively compete against communications carriers and satellite service providers 
if the cable service providers do not successfully compete  they may lose market share  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
market specific risks affecting the idtv  pc tv and television peripheral market segments of the dtv market could impair our ability to compete successfully in that market 
the market for dtv applications in idtvs  pc tvs and television peripherals is characterized by various market specific risks  any of which may adversely affect our ability to compete in that market 
examples of market specific risks affecting these market segments include the risk that module tuners that offer the same or similar functionality as our silicon tuner solutions will continue to be used by oems and will be viewed as more attractive by our current and potential customers  including the use by our potential customers of captive module tuner suppliers due to more favorable economic terms  the risk that module tuners that offer the same or similar functionality as our silicon tuner solutions will be sold at lower prices than our silicon tuner solutions  the risk that silicon tuners that offer the same or similar functionality as our silicon tuner solutions will be sold at lower prices than our silicon tuner solutions by competitors willing to accept lower gross margins to obtain design wins  the risk that the pc tv market will not be as large as anticipated or our share in the market will be lower than anticipated  the risk that tuner performance requirements for the pc tv market are less stringent and thereby increase the competitive element in this market  the risk that the suppliers of module tuners who currently sell tuners to television manufacturers that we are currently targeting with our silicon tuner may lower their prices  including to levels below their cost  in order to protect their existing relationships  thereby making our tuner uncompetitive from a customer cost perspective  the risk that we will be unable to develop silicon tuners that meet the performance requirements of our customers  risks related to systems integration and other risks  including the timing of open design windows  inherent in the highly complex design in process of the products designed to address this market  the risk that we will not be able to finalize the highly complex design in process for a particular customer application during the narrow customer design window  the risk that module products implementing our silicon tuners will not be selected by potential end customers due to the economics of the entire module solution where other components are unattractively priced  
table of contents the risk that our products will not have the feature set desired by our customers or will not be architecturally compatible with other components in the customers designs  the risk that an influx of entrants into the dtv market due to the transition to all digital broadcasts will accelerate average selling price erosion  and the risk that multi standard  multi band  universal television tuners will be preferred by dtv manufacturers and our multi standard  multi band  universal television tuners may not meet performance expectations or be available in the necessary timeframe 
our efforts to penetrate the dtv market  in particular  will depend on our ability to overcome the challenges described above and upon eventual acceptance of our new dtv products 
to the extent our efforts are adversely affected by any of these risks or are otherwise unsuccessful  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not realize significant revenue in relating to the ongoing coupon eligible converter box cecb market segment and year over year comparisons of total revenue and revenue from the dtv market will be difficult given the significant revenue realized from the cecb market segment in  which may not be replaced in the near future 
in anticipation of the planned termination of analog terrestrial off air television broadcasts in the united states in june for full power analog transmitters and the transition to digital terrestrial television broadcasts  the federal government has launched a program to subsidize the purchase of digital to analog converter boxes by consumers who wish to continue to watch television on their legacy analog televisions  which do not have a digital tuner and therefore would be otherwise unable to receive digital terrestrial television broadcast signals without a separate converter box 
the transition deadline for the termination of analog broadcasts has been delayed by the united states government to june and additional funds may be allocated to further subsidize this market 
this market is characterized by various market risks for the dtv market generally and market specific risks for the cecb market segment described immediately below  any of which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in the cecb market segment the risk that we may not be able to realize significant future revenue from the cecb market segment  the risk that we may not be able to accurately forecast demand for the remaining cecb opportunity as we expect a significant portion of any future net revenue for this market segment to be shipped through third party distributors  thereby reducing visibility into demand from end customers  the risk that orders and forecasted demand may be inflated by end customers and third party distributors and subject to future cancellation or delay to ensure component and product availability to support anticipated demand or potential upside demand  and the risk that year over year revenue comparisons will be viewed poorly should we not realize comparable revenue from this market segment in  given that approximately million in net revenue was realized from this market segment in this could negatively impact investor and analyst views of our future prospects and could negatively impact the price of our stock 
we operate in an intensely competitive business and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources and operating flexibility  which allow them to compete effectively against us in existing markets and may affect our ability to enter or effectively compete in new markets 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological changes  increasing degrees of component integration  evolving industry standards and price erosion 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors 
this competition has resulted and may continue to result in declining average selling prices for our rf products and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover research and development and manufacturing costs 
we expect competition to 
table of contents continue to increase as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter our target markets 
we compete with  or may in the future compete with  a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuit and system modules in the cable  automotive entertainment electronics and dtv markets 
in most cases we compete directly against system module solutions or against other integrated circuit module substitute products similar to our own 
in some cases our product is used inside a system module  in which case we compete against a large number of ic solutions providing various levels of integration 
companies providing system module solutions against whom we compete include captive and non captive module suppliers such as alps  lg innotek  oingjia  mitsumi  nutune  panasonic electronic devices  samsung electro mechanics  sanshin  sanyo  sharp  sony  toshiba and tcl 
integrated circuit companies against whom we compete for designs within system modules or compete for discrete designs intended to replace system modules include anadigics  broadcom  dibcom  entropic  maxim  maxlinear  nxp semiconductors and xceive 
average selling prices for products offered by competitor tuner module manufacturers continue to erode substantially  causing our silicon product offerings to be less attractive to potential customers and further limiting our design win opportunities  especially in the dtv market 
many of our current and potential competitors have advantages over us  including longer operating histories and established market positions in key markets  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases  significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  management  technical and other resources  existing relationships with potential customers as a result of the sales of other components  which can be leveraged into sales of products competitive with our rf products  existing relationships with partners in joint ventures or investing activities  which can be leveraged into sales of products competitive with our rf products  and broader product and service offerings that may allow them to compete effectively by bundling their tuner products with their other products and services  by legal or illegal means 
as a result  our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products which may harm our current market position and impact our ability to enter or compete effectively in new markets 
if we do not compete successfully  we may lose market share in our existing markets  our gross margins may fail to increase or may decline  and we may experience other material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success is highly dependent on our relationships with our strategic demodulator partners 
our rf products are designed to be interoperable with various specific demodulator integrated circuit products that are designed and manufactured by other companies 
historically  we have relied on informal strategic relationships with various demodulator manufacturers to enable both parties to offer an interoperable tuner demodulator solution to our mutual end customers 
although we work in concert with our third party demodulator partners to complete highly functional reference designs  we have no control over our partners future product plans and product roadmaps and could be effectively designed out of future customer applications by the refusal of a demodulator partner to continue to support our products 
likewise  our ability to acquire new customers is highly dependent on the cooperation of third party demodulator manufacturers 
if such third party manufacturers decide to partner with our competitors or to provide their own tuner solution  we would effectively be prevented from selling our products to potential new customers 
furthermore  our dependence on these third party demodulator manufacturers often limits the strategic direction of the company 
if we were to design 
table of contents products that were competitive with any of such demodulator manufacturers  they may choose to stop working with us 
additionally  certain of our demodulator partners may become insolvent in the current economic environment 
we often partner with companies that provide demodulation and or decoding ics for our mutual customers 
these partners have included amd  auvitek  quoxin  micronas  realtek  st microelectronics  texas instruments and zoran 
if any of our current or prospective demodulator partners were to stop working with us in favor of other tuner manufacturers or in favor of deploying their own tuner products or were to go out of business  we would be effectively designed out of current and potential customer s products and this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and our future prospects 
if competitors begin to offer cheaper integrated tuner demodulator products and we do not offer a competitive solution  we may lose significant market share to our competitors 
if our competitors begin to offer fully integrated tuner demodulator products in the future and we cannot offer an attractive solution  we may lose significant market share to our competitors 
certain of our competitors have announced fully integrated tuner demodulator solutions 
historically  these solutions have not achieved performance levels sufficient to target high performance cable or dtv applications 
however  we believe that future integrated offerings may be able to achieve these high performance thresholds  and thereby potentially provide customers with smaller and cheaper solutions 
the average selling prices of our products will likely decrease over time 
if the selling price reductions are greater than we expect  or if we are unable to effectively counter average selling price erosion through product cost reduction  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
historically  the average selling prices of our products have decreased over their lives 
in addition  as the markets for rf integrated circuit and module products mature  we believe that it is likely that the average unit prices of our rf products will decrease in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions  competitive product bundling and a transition in our markets from higher priced module products to lower priced integrated circuits 
in addition  the current economic crisis could cause our customers to ask for greater pricing concessions in response to pricing pressure from their end customers 
to offset these decreases  we expect to primarily rely on achieving manufacturing cost reductions for existing products and introducing new products with higher levels of integration and greater performance that can be sold at higher average selling prices 
although we will seek to increase the sales of our higher margin products  our sales and product development efforts may not be successful and our new products may not achieve market acceptance 
in addition  our new higher margin products may not be attractive to our customers to the extent that greater levels of performance and integration are not demanded by their end customers due to the current economic crisis 
to the extent we are unable to reduce costs or sell our higher margin products  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
if we do not complete our design in activities before a customer s design window closes  we will lose the design opportunity  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and future prospects 
the timing of our design in activities with key customers and prospective customers may not align with their open design windows  which may or may not be known to us  making design win predictions more difficult 
it may be difficult for us to determine our customer s design window timing 
if we miss a particular customer s design window  we may be forced to wait an entire year or even longer for the next opportunity to compete for the customer s next design 
because the timing of our design in activities with key customers and prospective customers are not always aligned with these customers open design windows  it is extremely difficult for us to make design win predictions 
any failure to complete a design in during a customer s design window may 
table of contents eliminate or substantially delay revenues from certain target customers and markets  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and future prospects 
other solutions for the cable  automotive entertainment electronics and dtv markets compete with some of our solutions 
if these solutions prove to be more reliable  faster  less expensive or more popular than our solutions  the demand for our rf products and our revenue may decrease 
some of our target market segments  such as cable modem and cable telephony services  are competing with a variety of non rf based broadband communications solutions  including digital subscriber line dsl technology and certain fiber to the home solutions 
many of these technologies compete effectively with cable modem and cable telephony services and do not require rf tuners like the ones that we sell 
if any of these competing technologies are  or are perceived to be  more reliable  faster  less expensive  able to reach more customers or have other advantages over rf broadband technology  the demand for our rf products may decrease  which would cause our revenue to decrease accordingly 
also  some of the consumer devices that currently incorporate our rf products  eg  televisions  may not use our tuners or other products we sell in the future 
such changes in device features or functionality could adversely affect our business  results of operations and future prospects 
industry participants may consolidate or establish financial or strategic relationships  adversely impacting our ability to compete in our markets 
consolidation by industry participants  such as acquisitions of our customers  suppliers or partners by our competitors  or acquisitions of our competitors by our customers  suppliers or partners  could result in competitors with increased market share  larger customer bases  greater diversified product offerings and greater technological and marketing expertise  which would allow them to compete more effectively against us 
current and potential competitors may also gain such competitive advantages by establishing financial or strategic relationships with existing or potential customers  suppliers or other third parties 
these new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge rapidly and acquire significant market share 
in addition  some of our suppliers or partners offer or may offer products that compete with our rf products 
further  we rely upon some of our partners for certain joint reference design and marketing activities and some of our products are incorporated in some of our partners reference designs that are provided to potential customers 
depending on the participants  industry consolidation or the formation of strategic relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations by reducing our ability to compete successfully in our current markets and the markets we are seeking to serve 
we expect our quarterly results of operations to continue to fluctuate 
our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect such quarterly results to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are not in our control 
these factors may include unexpected dramatic decreases in customer demand due to the current economic crisis  the timing  cancellation and rescheduling of significant customer orders  potentially with short notice periods  the ability of our customers to procure the other necessary components for their end products that utilize our products in order to conduct their operations  pricing concessions on volume sales to particular customers for established time frames and our ability to respond to general downward pressure on the average selling prices of our products  cyclical or seasonal slowdowns and general downturns in customer demand or related industry wide increases in inventories  
table of contents our ability to predict our customers demand for our products  manage production and inventory levels in response to product life cycles and other factors and minimize the effects of obsolete or excessive inventory  design wins and changes in our product and customer mix  labor disputes at our subsystem module manufacturer s facility in the philippines or at any of our other subcontractors  which may cause temporary slowdowns or shutdowns of operations  problems with our products that result in significant returns  inadequate allocation of wafer  assembly or test capacity for our silicon products by our subcontractors and or allocation of components used in our module products by our suppliers  inconsistent or non linear quarterly revenue that may result from our entry into new markets  such as mobile television  or new consumer products  such as dtv set top converter boxes because our customers may have difficulty accurately determining the initial demand for their new products  acts of terrorism or military action occurring anywhere in the world  and acts of god or force majeure 
it is likely that our quarterly results of operations will be adversely affected by one or more of the factors listed above  or other factors 
if our future results of operations fail to meet the expectations of stock market analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock may decline 
our research and development efforts are critical to our business and if these efforts are unsuccessful  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
any future success will depend  in large part  upon our ability to develop new rf products for existing and new markets  our ability to introduce these new products in a cost effective and timely manner  and our ability to meet customer specifications and convince leading manufacturers to select these new products for design into their new products 
developing new products and improving our existing products requires substantial continuing investments of engineering resources 
we have often encountered and continue to encounter difficulties attracting and retaining the highly sophisticated engineering personnel required to timely develop our products and meet our customers design windows 
in addition  the development of new rf products is highly complex and  from time to time  we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
in addition  some of our new product development efforts are focused on producing silicon products utilizing architectures and technologies with which we have little or no experience  and delivering performance characteristics  such as low power consumption  at levels that we have not previously achieved 
our success at addressing our target markets will often depend on our ability to co develop certain integrated products with certain partners 
these co development efforts involve inherently higher development risk and because they involve third parties  they provide us with less control over the development effort 
in addition  some of our past research and development efforts have failed 
successful product development depends on a number of factors  including the accuracy of our prediction of emerging market requirements and evolving standards  the acceptance of our new product designs by our customers and of our customers products by their end customers and consumers  the availability of qualified product designers and our ability to attract and retain them  and our ability to successfully design  develop  manufacture and integrate new components to increase our product functionality in a timely manner 
due to the relatively small size of our product design team  our research and development efforts in our core technologies may lag behind those of our competitors  some of whom have substantially greater financial and technical resources 
as a result of these factors  we may be unable to develop and introduce new rf products 
table of contents successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner  and any new products we develop and offer may never achieve market acceptance 
these failures would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties with respect to our rf products  and if we are unable to accurately predict customer demand for these products  we may incur excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our profit margin  or we may have insufficient inventory  which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potentially in loss of market share and damaged customer relationships 
our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders  and we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers  including our most significant customers  in terms of volume of sales 
our standard terms and conditions which do not apply to some of our key customers typically provide that our customers may cancel orders scheduled to ship outside days 
further  our terms typically provide that customers may reschedule orders that are scheduled to ship outside days  but customers typically are restricted to the number of days they can delay the ship date and the number of times that they can reschedule orders 
however  we have permitted customers to cancel orders less than days before the expected date of shipment and to re schedule shipments less than days before the expected date of shipment  with little or no penalty 
we currently do not have the ability to accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future 
anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face volatile pricing and unpredictable demand for their own products and are increasingly focused on cash preservation and tighter inventory management 
however  we place orders with our suppliers based on non binding forecasts of customer demand and  in some instances  may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand 
our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to  or at all 
as a result  we would hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available  we would forego revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
in addition  any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products could materially and adversely affect our profit margins  increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
the sales cycle for our rf products is long  and we incur substantial non recoverable expenses and devote significant resources to sales that may not be realized when anticipated  if at all 
our customers  and sometimes their customers  typically conduct significant evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance procedures before they purchase our rf products 
these evaluation processes are frequently lengthy and may range from three months to one year or more 
as a result  we expend significant financial and human resources to develop customer relationships before we realize any revenue from these relationships 
in fact  we may never realize any revenue from these efforts 
in many situations  our customers design their products to specifically incorporate our rf products  and our rf products must be designed to meet their stringent specifications 
this process can be complex and may require significant engineering  sales  marketing and management effort on our part 
this process may also require significant engineering and testing by our customers and  if our customers do not have sufficient capabilities to complete the process  they may become dissatisfied with our products  and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we customize a substantial portion of our rf subsystem module products to address our customers specific rf needs 
if we do not sell our customer specific products in large volumes  we may be unable to cover our fixed costs or may be left with substantial unsaleable inventory  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we manufacture a substantial portion of our rf subsystem module products to address the unique needs of our individual customers 
frequent product introductions by systems manufacturers make our future success 
table of contents dependent on our ability to select development projects that will result in sufficient volumes to enable us to achieve manufacturing efficiencies to cover our fixed costs 
because some of our customer specific rf module products are developed for unique applications  we expect that some of our current and future customer specific rf module products may never be produced in sufficient volume to cover our fixed costs 
in addition  if our customers fail to purchase these customized rf module products from us  we risk having substantial unsaleable inventory  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a product recall by a major customer could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we generally warrant our commercial products for a period of one year  and longer for automotive entertainment electronics products 
if a customer experiences a problem with our products and subsequently returns our products to us in large quantities for rework or replacement  the cost to us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of our agreements with our customers contain line down clauses  product liability clauses and or intellectual property warranty and indemnification clauses 
we are currently subject to line down clauses in agreements with certain customers 
such clauses require us to pay financial penalties if our failure to supply products in a timely manner causes the customer to slow down or stop their production 
such penalties could be large and  if incurred  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are also subject to product liability clauses and or intellectual property warranty and indemnification clauses in some of our customer agreements  and where we do not have agreements  we are subject to such default provisions in the relevant jurisdiction s embodiment of the uniform commercial code 
such clauses and warranties require us to pay financial penalties if we supply defective product  which results in financial damages to the customer  or to indemnify the customer for third party actions based on the alleged infringement by our products of a third party s intellectual property 
such penalties or obligations could be large and  if incurred  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to maintain or grow revenue from international sales could harm our financial results 
net revenue from outside of north america was  and for  and  respectively 
we plan to increase our international sales activities by adding international sales personnel  sales representatives or distributors 
our international sales will be limited if we cannot do so 
even if we are able to expand our international operations  we may not succeed in maintaining or increasing international market demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a majority of our revenues have historically come from our international customers  and  as a result  our business may be harmed by political and economic conditions in foreign markets and the challenges associated with operating internationally 
historically  revenues from international markets have represented the majority of our total net revenue 
we expect net revenue from international markets to continue to represent the majority of our total net revenue for the foreseeable future 
international business activities involve certain risks  including difficulties involved in the staffing and management of our geographically dispersed operations  longer sales cycles in certain countries  especially on initial entry into a new geographical market  greater difficulty evaluating a customer s ability to pay  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and greater difficulty in the collection of past due accounts  general economic conditions in each country  
table of contents challenges associated with operating in diverse cultural and legal environments  seasonal reductions in business activity specific to certain markets  loss of revenue  property and equipment from expropriation  nationalization  war  insurrection  terrorism  drug trafficking and other political risks  foreign taxes and the overlap of different tax structures  including modifications to the united states tax code as a result of international trade regulations  greater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property  foreign technical standards  import and export licensing requirements  tariffs  and other trade and travel restrictions  and existence or adoption of laws and regulations affecting the operation and taxation of our business and the general business climate for foreign companies 
to the extent our international sales are adversely affected by any of these risks or are otherwise unsuccessful  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we extend credit to our customers  sometimes in large amounts  but there is no guarantee every customer will be able to pay our invoices when they become due 
at various times  our accounts receivable is concentrated in a few customers 
as part of our routine business  we extend credit to customers purchasing our products 
at december   approximately of our net accounts receivable was due from five of our customers 
while our customers may have the ability to pay on the date of shipment or on the date credit is granted  their financial condition could change and there is no guarantee that customers will ever pay the invoices 
because all of our customers do not have the same credit terms  our outstanding accounts receivable balance can become concentrated in a smaller number of customers than our overall net revenue 
this concentration can subject us to a higher financial risk and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our customers products are subject to governmental regulation 
governmental regulation could place constraints on our customers and consequently reduce their demand for our rf products 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  has broad jurisdiction over several of our target markets in the united states 
similar governmental agencies regulate our target markets in other countries 
although most of our products are not directly subject to current regulations of the fcc or any other federal or state communications regulatory agency  much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated is subject to direct governmental regulation 
accordingly  the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may  in turn  impede sales of our products 
for example  demand for our rf products will decrease if equipment incorporating our products fails to comply with fcc specifications 
our dependence on a single manufacturing facility and a single subcontractor for almost all of our subsystem module solutions could jeopardize our operations 
the majority of our subsystem module solutions manufacturing operations are subcontracted to ionics ems  inc such operations are conducted at a single facility in manila  philippines 
we are exposed to manufacturing risks as a result of our dependence on a single manufacturing facility and a single sub contractor for our subsystem module solutions 
such risks include lack of control over delivery 
table of contents schedules  manufacturing yields  quality and fabrication costs and the risk of material supply disruptions due to labor disputes  terrorism  political unrest  war  process abnormalities  human error  theft  government intervention  or a natural disaster such as a fire  earthquake  or flood 
if we encounter any significant delays or disruptions  including those caused by our subcontractor s inability to procure component parts or supply us with product  we may not be able to meet our manufacturing and testing requirements  which could cause a significant delay in our ability to deliver our products  resulting in losses and potential enforcement of contractual line down clauses by our customers  potentially subjecting us to legal expenses and settlement payments 
additionally  our subcontractor could elect to close its production facility or require us to move to another production facility or subcontractor 
any resulting delay could result in increased expense and costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we depend on third party wafer subcontractors to manufacture all of our integrated circuit products  which reduce our control over the integrated circuit manufacturing process and could increase costs and decrease the availability of our integrated circuit products 
we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility 
we primarily rely on ibm  jazz semiconductor and x fab  outside subcontractors  to produce most of our rf integrated circuit products 
our reliance on third party suppliers involves risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and fabrication costs and the risk of material supply disruptions 
we do not have a long term supply agreement with our subcontractors and instead obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis 
our subcontractors have no obligation to supply products to us for any specific period or in any specific quantity  except as set forth in a particular purchase order 
our requirements  generally  represent a small portion of the total production capacity of these subcontractors  and they may reallocate capacity to other customers even during periods of high demand for our integrated circuits 
if our subcontractors were unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our integrated circuits  our business would be materially adversely affected 
in such an event  we would be required to identify and qualify substitute subcontractors  which would be time consuming and difficult  and may result in unforeseen manufacturing and operational problems 
in addition  if competition for foundry capacity increases  our product costs may increase  and we may be required to pay significant amounts to secure access to manufacturing services 
if we do not qualify or receive supplies from additional subcontractors  we may be exposed to increased risk of capacity shortages due to our dependence on ibm  jazz semiconductor and x fab 
in addition  the processing of our ic products is specific to the manufacturing processes of a given supplier and substantial lead time would be required to move the specific product to another supplier  if it were possible at all 
although we have begun using jazz semiconductor as an alternate source for certain of our ic products  there can be no assurance that the establishment of an alternate manufacturing source would successfully mitigate the risks identified above 
we depend on third party subcontractors for integrated circuit probing  packaging and testing  which reduces our control over these processes and could result in increased costs and decreased availability of our integrated circuit products 
our integrated circuit products are probed  packaged  and or tested by independent subcontractors  including amkor  ase  ise and criteria labs  using facilities located in south korea  philippines  and austin  texas 
we do not have long term agreements with these subcontractors and typically obtain services from them on a purchase order basis 
furthermore  our subcontractors are dependent on certain third party test equipment manufacturers 
our reliance on these subcontractors and on certain third party test equipment manufacturers involves risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
these risks could result in product shortages or increase our costs of probing  packaging and testing our products 
if these subcontractors are unable or unwilling to continue to provide probing  packaging and testing services of acceptable quality  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in such an event  we would be required to identify and qualify substitute subcontractors  which could be time consuming and difficult and may result in unforeseen operational problems 

table of contents if our customers do not qualify our products or the manufacturing lines of our third party suppliers for volume shipments  our revenue may be delayed or reduced 
some customers will not purchase any of our products  other than limited numbers of evaluation units  prior to qualification of the manufacturing lines for the product 
we may not always be able to satisfy the qualifications 
delays or failure to qualify can cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue 
if we change third party suppliers  customers may require us to qualify the new supplier s facility  or a product manufactured by that facility 
we believe that transitioning our silicon products to newer or better manufacturing process technologies will be important to our future competitive position 
if we fail to make this transition efficiently  our competitive position could be seriously harmed 
we continually evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to higher performance or lower cost process technologies in order to produce higher performance  more efficient or better integrated circuits because we believe this migration is required to remain competitive 
other companies in the industry have experienced difficulty in migrating to new process technologies and  consequently  have suffered reduced yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels 
we may experience similar difficulties 
moreover  we are dependent on our relationships with subcontractors to successfully migrate to newer or better processes 
our foundry suppliers may not make newer or better process technologies available to us on a timely or cost effective basis  if at all 
if our foundry suppliers do not make newer or better manufacturing process technologies available to us on a timely or cost effective basis  or if we experience difficulties in migrating to these processes  it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and business prospects 
uncertainties in our production planning process could have a material adverse effect on our business 
for many of our products  our manufacturing lead time is greater than the delivery lead times we quote our customers 
therefore  in many cases we routinely manufacture or purchase inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our rf products  which demand is difficult to predict 
the cancellation or re scheduling of product orders  the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in our holding excess or obsolete inventory that could substantially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our inability to produce and ship rf products to our customers in a timely manner could harm our reputation and damage our relationships with our customers 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical 
if there is a sustained upturn in the semiconductor market  there could be a resulting increase in demand for foundry and other subcontracted services  significantly reducing product availability and increasing our costs 
the semiconductor industry periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints 
an increase in demand for semiconductors could substantially increase the cost of producing our rf products  and consequently reduce our profit margins 
as a result  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future results of operations due to general semiconductor industry conditions 
our business may be harmed if we fail to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality agreements and procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we currently have patents issued and pending in the united states and in foreign countries 
we intend to seek further united states and international patents on our technology 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications  that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold or that any claims will be allowed from pending applications or will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage 
while we generally seek patent protection for our innovations  it is possible that some of 
table of contents these innovations may not be protectable 
if our patents do not adequately protect our technology  our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours 
our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
in addition  even when we do hold valid patents that we could potentially assert against a competitor s infringing products  it may not be practicable  effective or cost efficient for us to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights fully  particularly  where the initiation of a claim might harm our business relationships or risk a debilitating countersuit by a competitor with patents that may read on our products 
our competitors also may be able to design around our patents 
the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  increasing the possibility of piracy of our technology and products 
in addition to patent and copyright protection  we also rely on trade secrets  technical know how and other non patented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities  which we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our customers  partners  suppliers and employees 
we cannot be certain that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that trade secrets and proprietary know how will not otherwise become known by others 
although we intend to protect and vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
our competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
despite our efforts and procedures to protect our intellectual property through the prosecution of patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets and other methods  we cannot assure you that our current intellectual property or any intellectual property we may obtain through acquisitions or by other means will be free from third party claims which may be valid 
any third party claims may lead to costly and time consuming litigation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation that could seriously harm our business and compromise our intellectual property position 
we have been involved in intellectual property litigation in the past and may become involved in intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or defend against allegations of infringement asserted by others 
legal proceedings could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate our proprietary rights either through litigation or a petition for uspto re examination initiated by a competitor 
any litigation  regardless of its outcome  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel 
the expense associated with intellectual property litigation  the diversion of time and attention of our management and technical personnel from our daily operations caused by such litigation and any legal limitation placed upon our products and or our business related to such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
furthermore  we have initiated  and may initiate in the future  claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish their validity 
even if we successfully assert our intellectual property against a competitor in litigation  our patents may be challenged through a uspto re examination  which cannot be settled by the mutual agreement of the parties 
our ability to sell our rf products may be adversely affected if it is determined that we or our customers infringe on the intellectual property of a third party or if any of our issued patents are determined to be invalid 
the electronics industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions  which may result in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
our customers may 
table of contents be subject to infringement claims for their products which incorporate our rf products 
if any claims of infringement are made against any of our customers  our customers may seek to involve us in the litigation and demand indemnification from us 
the resolution of such a claim against our customer may cause our customer to reduce or completely eliminate marketing its infringing product  which would decrease our sales of rf products to this customer 
further  if our customer were to prevail in its claim for indemnification against us  or if we were found to infringe any third party intellectual property  we could be required to pay substantial damages and royalties on our historical and future product sales  indemnify our customers for their legal fees and damages paid  stop manufacturing  using and selling the infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of some of our processes  or obtain licenses to the infringed intellectual property to sell or use the relevant technology  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we may be unsuccessful in developing non infringing products or obtaining licenses upon commercially reasonable terms 
we may be unable to resolve these problems which could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not anticipate and adapt to evolving industry standards in the cable  automotive entertainment electronics and dtv markets  or if industry standards develop more slowly than we expect  our products could become obsolete and we could lose market share 
applications and devices for cable  automotive entertainment electronics and dtv markets often are based on industry standards that are continuously evolving 
we have often directed our development toward producing rf products that comply with these evolving standards 
in some cases  the development of these standards takes longer than originally anticipated 
the delayed development of a standard in our target markets has and could result in slower deployment of new technologies  which can harm our ability to sell our rf products  or frustrate the continued use of our proprietary technologies  due to the anticipation of the deployment of a standard 
the continued delay in the development of these industry standards could result in fewer manufacturers purchasing our rf products in favor of continuing to use the proprietary technologies designed by our competitors 
such delayed development of industry standards and the resulting slower deployment of new technologies would result in diminished and or delayed revenue and consequently harm our business 
additionally  our competitors may attempt to relax anticipated standards that we have expended significant research and development funds to meet  thereby eliminating any technical advantages that our products may have 
further  if new unexpected industry standards do emerge  and we have failed to accurately anticipate or design products that meet such standards  our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete 
our ability to adapt to changes and to anticipate future standards and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards is a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
our inability to anticipate the evolving standards for our rf products in the cable  automotive entertainment electronics and dtv markets  or to develop and introduce new products that are functionally and economically competitive into these markets  could result in diminished revenue and  consequently  harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these evolving standards 

table of contents we have experienced volatility in our stock price and it may fluctuate in the future 
therefore  you may be unable to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
for example  during  our common stock traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors  many of which are outside of our control  including quarterly variations in our financial performance  our business prospects  the performance and prospects of our major customers  the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock  investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate  changes in earnings estimates or buy sell recommendations by analysts  short term investor trading strategies  general financial and other market conditions  and domestic and international economic and political conditions 
public stock markets have experienced  and are currently experiencing as a result of the current economic crisis  extreme price and trading volume volatility  particularly in the technology sectors of the market 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  fluctuations in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum  hedge or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction  particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
currency fluctuations related to our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
a significant portion of our international revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  and we have experienced significant fluctuations in our financial results due to changing exchange rates rather than operational changes 
for example  the foreign currency exchange loss was million in we expect to continue to rely significantly on international sales and foreign subcontractors for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we expect currency fluctuations to continue  and such fluctuations may significantly impact our financial results in the future 
currently  we do not engage in currency hedging activities  and in the future  we may choose to engage in currency hedging activities to reduce these fluctuations  which may or may not prove to be successful 
we cannot assure our stockholders that purchases made under our stock repurchase program will enhance long term stockholder value and any future stock repurchase programs may not enhance long term stockholder value  could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves 
on april   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program 
under the program  we were authorized to repurchase up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock until the end of  through open market and privately negotiated transactions  at times and in such amounts as we deemed appropriate 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depended on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows  price  corporate and regulatory requirements  and other market conditions 
the program was completed on december  with final repurchase activity concluding on november  
table of contents any future repurchases pursuant to a new stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility 
the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock 
additionally  a stock repurchase program would diminish our cash reserves  which could impact our ability to pursue strategic opportunities and acquisitions and could result in lower overall returns on our cash balances 
there can be no assurance that any future stock repurchases would enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock 
we repurchased approximately  shares in at an average price of 
as of february   our closing stock price was 
although a stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long term stockholder value  short term stock price fluctuations could reduce any program s effectiveness 
as of december   we had repurchased and retired approximately  shares of our common stock at a cost of million and million was unused under the program which expired on december  our results of operations will be adversely impacted by a worldwide macroeconomic downturn 
as a result of this adverse impact on our business and general investor concern regarding the current economic crisis  the market price of our common stock may be negatively impacted 
in  general worldwide economic conditions have experienced a downturn due to the effects of the lending crisis  general credit market crisis  collateral effects on the finance and banking industries  volatile energy costs  concerns about inflation  slower economic activity  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns 
these conditions make it difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  and they could cause us and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products  which would delay and lengthen sales cycles 
forecasted demand of many of our customers for has declined and as a result  we have also experienced order push outs and cancellations 
we cannot predict the timing or duration of any economic slowdown or the timing or strength of a subsequent economic recovery  worldwide or in the semiconductor industry  generally  or in the cable  automotive entertainment electronics or dtv markets specifically 
if the cable  automotive entertainment electronics or dtv markets significantly deteriorate due to these macroeconomic effects  our business  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  our stock price could decrease if investors have concerns that our business  financial condition and results of operations will be negatively impacted by a worldwide macroeconomic downturn 
we may need to obtain capital required to grow our business 
from time to time  we may find it necessary or we may choose to seek additional financing if our strategic growth plans change  or if industry or market conditions are favorable for a particular type of financing 
our capital requirements depend upon several factors  including the need to fund future acquisitions  the capital required to meet our research and development objectives  the rate of market acceptance of our products  our ability to expand our customer base  our level of expenditures for sales and marketing  the cost of product and service upgrades and other factors 
if our capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds if needed 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced 
further  if we issue equity securities  the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock 
if we issue debt securities  the debt securities generally will have rights senior to those of existing holders of equity securities 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to acquire strategic businesses  develop our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 

table of contents our business could be disrupted if we are unable to successfully integrate any businesses  technologies  product lines or services that we may acquire in the future 
as part of our business strategy  we may review and selectively pursue potential acquisitions that could complement our current product offerings  augment our market coverage  complement our technical capabilities  or that would otherwise provide growth opportunities 
while we currently have no imminent plans to pursue an acquisition  we may make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into joint ventures or strategic alliances with other companies in the future  which may entail many risks 
specific examples of risks that could relate to such transactions include risks that we will be unable to successfully integrate the acquired company s personnel and businesses  risks that we will be unable to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value associated with the transactions  risks related to acquisition related charges and amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles that could negatively affect our reported results of operations  risks that such transactions will divert management s time and attention and disrupt our ongoing business  risks that we will be unable to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired company  risks that we will be unable to establish and maintain uniform standards controls  procedures and policies  risks related to unanticipated costs  capital expenditures or working capital requirements and the assumption of unknown liabilities or other unanticipated events or circumstances  risks that the acquired company s customers will not desire to conduct business with us  risks related to strained relationships with employees  suppliers and customers resulting from the integration of new personnel  and risks related to strained relationships with strategic partners who may compete with the acquired company 
in addition  future acquisitions or investments may require us to materially reduce our cash reserves  issue additional equity  which would be dilutive to our stockholders  or to incur debt 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition or joint venture will be successfully integrated with our operations and the failure to avoid these or other risks associated with such acquisitions or investments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our quality certifications are subject to periodic re evaluation 
our design facility located in ingolstadt  germany is currently iso and iso certified 
these certifications and others are subject to recertification on a periodic basis 
if we are unable to obtain any such recertification  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our products are subject to certain environmental standards 
beginning in july  our product shipments into certain regions of the world were required to conform to the european union s directive for the restriction of certain hazardous substances rohs in electrical and electronic equipment 
we currently have rohs compliant versions of our silicon products and we are in the process of altering our applicable subsystem module solutions to also be rohs compliant 
if our customers are unable to re qualify the lead free versions of our products or our subsystem module manufacturers are unable to meet the rohs lead free standards in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our international operations  including our operations in germany  japan  taiwan  china  south korea and the united kingdom  the operations of our international suppliers and our overall financial results may be adversely affected by events that occur in or otherwise affect these countries 
we currently have facilities and suppliers located outside of the united states  including research and development operations in germany and sales offices in japan  taiwan  china  south korea and the united kindgom 
other than ibm  jazz semiconductor  ise and criteria labs  substantially all of our suppliers are located outside the united states  and substantially all of our products are manufactured outside the united states 
as a result  our operations are affected by the local conditions in those countries  as well as actions taken by the governments of those countries 
for example  if the philippines government enacts restrictive laws or regulations  or increases taxes paid by manufacturing operations in that country  the cost of manufacturing our products in the philippines could increase substantially  causing a decrease in our gross margins and profitability 
in addition  if any country  including the united states  imposes significant import restrictions on our products  our ability to import our products into that country from our international manufacturing and packaging facilities could be diminished or eliminated 
local economic and political instability in areas in the far east  in particular in the philippines and south korea  where there has been political instability in the past  could result in unpleasant or intolerable conditions for workers  and ultimately could result in a shutdown of our facilities or our subcontractor s facilities 
our success could be jeopardized by the loss of key personnel or an inability to attract qualified candidates 
any success we may have in the future  including our ability to grow and support future customers  will depend to a significant degree upon the continued service of our personnel  particularly our key personnel and executive management 
the members of our executive management team are not generally parties to employment agreements with microtune 
the loss of one or more members of our executive management team or other key personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel with experience in rf engineering  integrated circuit design and software and technical marketing and support 
we are extremely dependent on certain key engineering personnel 
should we lose one or more of these key engineering personnel  it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to design our products and support our customers 
additionally  if we do not meet our hiring targets  we may be unable to support our key prospective customers and we may lose the ability to enter large emerging markets  resulting in a material adverse effect on our future prospects 
we rely heavily upon equity compensation incentives  such as options to purchase our common stock to attract  retain and motivate such personnel 
the equity incentives of our competitors and other elements of our competitors compensation structures  particularly cash compensation  may be significantly more attractive than the compensation packages we offer 
in addition  due to the current market price of our common stock  most  if not all  of our outstanding stock option awards are out of the money  further hampering our ability to retain our personnel 
with respect to retaining personnel  the market price of  or other price attainable for  our common stock directly affects the relative attractiveness and effectiveness of our stock options as a recruiting and retention tool 
in the past  our common stock price has been substantially higher than currently prevailing prices 
any future poor operating performance we experience may cause the price of our common stock to decline from current levels 
a lower market price of our common stock  along with any related deterioration in the morale of our personnel regarding this component of their compensation  may result in our loss of personnel  including key personnel and executive management 
these personnel losses could reasonably be expected to have a prompt  material and adverse effect on our business and operations 

table of contents additionally  we may have to explore the possibility of opening design centers in locations where attractive candidates prefer to live 
we opened a design center in plantation  florida in february and in boulder  colorado in september in order to acquire additional engineering talent 
to the extent we pursue the strategy of opening additional remote locations  our cost structure may increase at a higher rate than if attractive candidates were employed at existing facilities 
the competition for attracting qualified candidates is intense  particularly in the rf silicon and rf systems industries 
our ability to attract qualified candidates is essential to any success we may have in the future 
for the reasons described above  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified technical  management  and other candidates necessary for the design  development  manufacture and sale of our rf products in the future

there is no guarantee that our insurance coverage  including our directors and officers liability insurance  will be sufficient to cover any potential liability and any shortfall in insurance coverage would impact our cash position which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we purchase various insurance policies to cover specifically designated risks in varying amounts 
there is no guarantee that when a claim arises under any of the covered risks that our coverage will be sufficient to cover the entire claim or that any specific claim will be covered  even in part  by insurance 
specifically  if the sec is the prevailing party in the current ongoing litigation against two of our former officers  our insurance carrier may demand the repayment by microtune of previously reimbursed legal expenses incurred by the former officers in the defense of this litigation 
furthermore  directors and officers liability insurance may not be available to us in sufficient amounts to cover any claims made or defense costs incurred if securities litigation is filed against us in the future 
these factors may result in rapid and substantial depletion of our cash reserves  and this depletion may result in our inability to properly operate our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
