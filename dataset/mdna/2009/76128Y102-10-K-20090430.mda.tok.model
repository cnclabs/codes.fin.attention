table of contents on april   we sold all of the outstanding stock of filene s basement and certain related entities to fb ii acquisition corp  a newly formed entity owned by buxbaum holdings  inc except as otherwise indicated  the description of the filene s basement business in this annual report on form k  including this item  is of the business as operated in the fiscal year ended january  we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements 
the discussion also provides information about the financial results of the various segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how those segments and their results affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company as a whole 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report on form k 
key financial measures in evaluating the results of operations  our management refers to a number of key financial and non financial measures relating to the performance of our business segments 
among our key financial measures are net sales  operating profit  and net income 
non financial measures that we use in evaluating our performance include number of stores  leased operations  net sales per average gross square foot for our stores and change in comparable store sales 
comparable store sales is a measure which indicates the performance of our existing stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year 
for fiscal and prior years  we considered comparable store sales to be sales at stores that have been in operation for at least months at the beginning of the fiscal year 
comparable store sales are also referred to as comp store sales by others within the retail industry 
the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry 
as a result  our calculation of comparable store sales may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the company s revenues are generated through sales from existing stores  through sales from new stores  and through sales from dsw 
com 
in fiscal  dsw opened new stores and closed two stores 
for fiscal  dsw plans to open approximately new stores 
although continued expansion could place increased demands on our financial  managerial  operational and administrative resources and result in increased demands on management  we do not believe that our anticipated growth plan will have an unfavorable impact on our operations or liquidity 
the current slowdown in the united states economy has adversely affected consumer confidence and consumer spending habits  which has resulted in further reductions in customer traffic and comparable store sales in our existing stores with the resultant increase in inventory levels and markdowns 
these negative economic conditions may also affect future profitability and may cause us to reduce the number of future store openings  impair goodwill or impair long lived assets 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization  recoverability of long lived assets including intangible assets  the calculation of retirement benefits  estimates for self insurance reserves for health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  product mix  and in some cases  actuarial and appraisal techniques 
we constantly re evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
while we believe that our historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate 
as the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment  actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

table of contents we believe the following represent the most critical estimates and assumptions  among others  used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the selection  application and disclosure of the critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
revenue recognition 
revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon customer receipt of merchandise  net of returns and exclude sales tax and are not recognized until collectability is reasonably assured 
for dsw 
com  we estimate a time lag for shipments to record revenue when the customer receives the goods 
we believe a one day change in our estimate would not materially impact our revenue 
net sales also include revenue from shipping and handling while the related costs are included in cost of sales 
revenue from gift cards is deferred and the revenue is recognized upon redemption of the gift card 
our policy is to recognize income from breakage of gift cards when the likelihood of redemption of the gift card is remote 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that we had accumulated enough historical data to recognize income from gift card breakage 
miscellaneous income is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we recognized million and million as miscellaneous income from gift card breakage in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  excluding discontinued operations 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had not recognized any income from gift card breakage 
cost of sales and merchandise inventories 
we use the retail method of accounting for substantially all of our merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are stated at the realizable value  determined using the first in  first out basis  or market  using the retail inventory method 
the retail inventory method is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on our consolidated balance sheet is decreased by charges to cost of sales at the time the retail value of the inventory is lowered through the use of markdowns  which are reductions in prices due to customers perception of value 
accordingly  earnings are negatively impacted as merchandise is marked down prior to sale 
inherent in the calculation of inventories are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including setting the original merchandise retail value or markon  markups of initial prices established  markdowns and estimates of losses between physical inventory counts or shrinkage  which  combined with the averaging process within the retail method  can significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  and the resulting gross profit 
if our estimate of shrinkage were to increase or decrease as a percentage of net sales  it would result in approximately million decrease or increase to operating profit 
investments 
dsw determines the appropriate balance sheet classification of its investments at time of purchase and evaluates the classification at each balance sheet date 
if dsw has the intent and ability to hold the investments to maturity  investments are classified as held to maturity 
held to maturity securities are stated at amortized cost plus accrued interest 
otherwise  dsw investments are classified as available for sale 
dsw s investments in auction rate securities are recorded at fair value under fas using an income approach valuation model that uses level inputs such as the financial condition of the issuers of the underlying securities  expectations regarding the next successful auction  risks in the auction rate securities market and other various assumptions 
dsw s other types of investments are valued using a market based approach using level inputs such as prices of similar assets in active markets 
dsw believes that changes in its valuation model would not result in a material change to earnings 
dsw evaluates its investments for impairment and whether an impairment is other than temporary 
in determining whether an impairment has occurred  dsw reviews information about the underlying investment that is publicly available and assesses its ability to hold the securities for the foreseeable future 
based on the nature of the impairment s  dsw would record a temporary impairment as an unrealized loss in other comprehensive income or an other than temporary impairment in earnings 
the investment is written down to its current market value at the time the impairment is deemed to have occurred 

table of contents asset impairment and long lived assets 
we must periodically evaluate the carrying amount of our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment  and finite life intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review to ascertain if any assets have been impaired 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows from the asset 
our reviews are conducted at the lowest identifiable level which includes a store 
the impairment loss recognized is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value  based on discounted future cash flows 
should an impairment loss be realized  it will be included in operating expenses 
assets acquired for stores that have been previously impaired are not capitalized when acquired if the store s expected future cash flow remains negative 
during fiscal  and  we recorded  excluding discontinued operations  impairment losses of million  million  and million  respectively  related to long lived assets at store operating units 
we believe at this time that the carrying values and useful lives of long lived assets continue to be appropriate 
we do not believe that there will be material changes in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate asset impairments 
to the extent these future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from our current estimates 
self insurance reserves 
we record estimates for certain health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance costs that are self insured programs 
self insurance reserves include actuarial estimates of both claims filed  carried at their expected ultimate settlement value  and claims incurred but not yet reported 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
health and welfare  workers compensation and general liability estimates are calculated utilizing claims development estimates based on historical experience and other factors 
we have purchased stop loss insurance to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per person basis for health and welfare and on a per claim basis for workers compensation and casualty insurance 
although we do not anticipate the amounts ultimately paid will differ significantly from our estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from the historical trends and the actuarial assumptions 
for example  for workers compensation and general liability estimates  a increase or decrease to the assumptions for claims costs and loss development factors would increase or decrease our self insurance by approximately million 
the self insurance reserves  excluding discontinued operations  were million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in self insurance reserves was principally associated with the decrease in general liability 
pension 
the obligations and related assets of the filene s basement defined benefit retirement plan are included in the operations held for sale at january  and are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize the yield on fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
at january   the weighted average actuarial assumptions applied to our plan were a discount rate of and long term rate of return on plan assets of 
at february   the weighted average actuarial assumptions applied to our plan were a discount rate of and long term rate of return on plan assets of 
to the extent actual results vary from assumptions  earnings would be impacted 
customer loyalty program 
dsw maintains a customer loyalty program for the dsw stores and dsw 
com in which program members earn reward certificates that result in discounts on future purchases 
upon reaching the target earned threshold  the members receive reward certificates for these discounts which must be redeemed within six months 
dsw accrues the anticipated redemptions of the discount earned at the time of the initial purchase 
to estimate these costs  dsw is required to make assumptions related to customer purchase levels and redemption rates based on historical experience 
the accrued liability as of january  and february  was million and million  respectively 
change in fair value of derivative instruments 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  the company recognizes all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivatives that are not designated as hedges under sfas no 
 changes in the fair values are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
the company uses the black scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of derivative instruments 
for the fiscal years ended january  and february   the company recorded a benefit of million and million  respectively  related to the change in fair value of warrants 
for the fiscal years ended january  and february   the company recorded a benefit of million and million  respectively  related to the change in the fair value of the conversion feature of the pies 
at january   if the estimated discount rate were to have increased by  the effect on the fair value of the warrants would have been less than million and would have decreased the fair value of the conversion feature of the pies by approximately million 

table of contents income taxes 
we are required to determine the aggregate amount of income tax expense to accrue and the amount which will be currently payable based upon tax statutes of each jurisdiction in which we do business 
in making these estimates  we adjust income based on a determination of generally accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities  as a result of these differences  are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences that will reverse in subsequent years 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if our management had made these determinations on a different basis  our tax expense  assets and liabilities could be different 
during fiscal  a decrease in valuation reserve of million for deferred tax assets was recorded 
during fiscal  we established an additional valuation reserve of million for deferred tax assets 
following the completion of the dsw ipo in june  dsw is no longer included in retail ventures consolidated federal tax return

inflation and deflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation or deflation because of the nature of the estimates required  management believes that the effect of inflation or deflation  if any  on the results of operations and financial condition has been minor  however  there can be no assurance that the business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future 
liquidity and capital resources retail ventures has begun reviewing its available options to the extent it may become necessary to manage and enhance its liquidity position 
although rvi s plan to enhance liquidity could include  among other things  the sale or collateralization of shares of common stock of dsw inc or a sale of equity by rvi  no assurance can be given that any such transaction can be completed on favorable terms or that such a transaction would satisfy all of rvi s liquidity requirements 
our primary ongoing cash requirements are for debt service plus seasonal and new store inventory purchases  capital expenditures in connection with store expansion  improving our information systems  the development of dsw 
com  the remodeling of existing stores and infrastructure growth 
the primary sources of funds for these liquidity needs are cash flow from operations and credit facilities 
for dsw  their working capital and inventory levels typically build seasonally 
dsw believes that they have sufficient financial resources and access to financial resources at this time 
dsw is committed to a cash management strategy that maintains liquidity to adequately support the operations of the business  its growth strategy and to withstand unanticipated business volatility 
dsw believes that cash generated from dsw operations  together with its current levels of cash and equivalents and short term investments  as well as availability under its revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to maintain its ongoing operations  support seasonal working capital requirements and fund capital expenditures related to projected business growth 
except as noted  the following discussion is based upon the consolidated liquidity position of rvi
