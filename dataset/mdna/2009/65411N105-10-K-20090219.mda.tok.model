highlights market conditions 
general economic conditions were poor during and worsened throughout the year 
we believe economic conditions have adversely impacted our business as we have observed lower hospital admission rates  lower emergency room admissions and some deferral of elective healthcare by patients 
these trends have lessened the growth in the number of radiological reads and have impacted the overall growth in the teleradiology market 
in addition  we have noticed slowing in collection rates from our customers  specifically hospital customers  which resulted in higher bad debt expense 
integration of acquisitions 
during  we completed the integration of our acquisitions made in of midwest physicians services  llc mps  emergency radiology services  llc ers  the radlinx group  ltd 
radlinx and teleradiology diagnostic service  inc tds 
we consolidated office space and restructured our staffing levels in order to streamline our business processes and to better utilize our leased office facilities 
management turnover 
we experienced management turnover in in february  we announced mr 
tim murnane as our new chief operating officer  replacing outgoing chief operating officer  timothy mayleben 
in may  we announced the appointment of mr 
david sankaran as our new chief financial officer  who replaced glenn cole as the outgoing chief financial officer 
finally  in november  we announced that mr 
david engert would be succeeding dr 
paul berger as our president and chief executive officer and that mr 
jon berger  one of our founders  would no longer be serving in an active role with the company 
capital structure 
during the year  we made some significant investments to realign our capital structure 
first  in june  we completed a tender offer which resulted in the purchase and retirement of million shares at a cost of million 
then  in december  we commenced a 
table of contents million open market share repurchase plan 
as of december   we had purchased and retired an additional million shares at a cost of million  and the remaining million under the plan was purchased in january and resulted in the retirement of another million shares 
in addition to these share repurchase activities  we also applied approximately million of our cash to lower our outstanding debt and lock in lower interest rates on the debt 
specifically  in december  we took advantage of historically low interest rates and utilized approximately million to settle our two existing interest rate swap contracts and entered into new interest rate swap contracts with more favorable rates 
in addition  we paid million for a principal prepayment on our debt 
trends in our business and results of operations service revenue 
we generate revenue from a number of sources  including off hours preliminary exams  business services offerings and final and subspecialty interpretations 
the revenue growth that we have historically experienced has been due in large part to the growth of our off hours preliminary business  which continues to make up the bulk of our revenue 
the market for off hours preliminary interpretations has historically experienced rapid volume growth 
this volume growth has been driven by an increase in our customer base  an increase in utilization of our services by our customers  acquisitions  an expansion of our service hours  a high customer retention rate and growth in the use of diagnostic imaging technologies and procedures in the healthcare industry in general 
in recent quarters  however  our volume growth has moderated as the market for these services has matured 
in addition  the off hours preliminary market has attracted a number of national and regional teleradiology service providers that often offer their services at prices lower than ours and the increase in competition has resulted in some customer losses 
these trends have resulted in downward pressure on our average prices and on our volumes and revenues 
we expect these trends to continue in the foreseeable future 
in response to such trends  our strategy is to sell new services including final interpretations and business services to our existing customers by communicating their value and demonstrating the advantages we offer over our competitors 
our future growth depends primarily upon our ability to successfully execute that strategy while also effectively responding to competitive pressures in the market for off hours preliminary exams 
these new services accounted for approximately of our total revenue in  up from in the prior year 
professional services 
professional service expenses consist primarily of the fees we pay to affiliated radiologists  any physician stock based compensation  the premiums for medical liability insurance  and any medical liability claims loss expenses 
since inception  our professional service fees have increased in absolute dollars each year  primarily due to the addition of new affiliated radiologists to perform an increased workload volume as our business has grown 
we expect that our professional service fees will continue to fluctuate in absolute dollars as volumes vary 
our medical liability expense has also increased in absolute dollars each year since inception  primarily due to increases in our medical liability premiums as our business has grown 
the increase is also due to an increasing reserve for incurred but not reported ibnr claims based on growing volumes  which are estimated using historical claims information and industry indices 
we expect our medical liability premiums and our ibnr expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as our scan volumes continue to grow 
in addition  if we have claims in future periods for which we deem a liability to be probable  our medical liability expense will increase 
we record physician stock based compensation expense in connection with any equity based grants to our affiliated radiologists in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf and present this expense in our consolidated statements of operations as part of our professional services expense 
the amount of physician stock based compensation expense we record in a given period depends primarily on the number of shares subject to equity based grants held by our affiliated 
table of contents radiologists  the number of hours worked  and the change in the value of our common stock in that period 
our expense in future periods for physician stock based compensation will be driven primarily by changes in our stock price  new equity based grants we make to our affiliated radiologists  and the rate at which those equity based grants are earned over such periods 
sales  general and administrative expenses 
our sales  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for all employees  employee stock based compensation  information technology and telecommunications expenses  costs associated with licensing and privileging our affiliated radiologists  facilities and office related expenses  sales and marketing expenses and other general and administrative expenses 
our sales  general and administrative expense has increased in absolute dollars each year since inception primarily as a result of increased payroll expenses in connection with higher headcount in support of the growth in our business 
in  the increase was also partially due to severance costs related to the departure of certain of our executives 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to level off in response to the moderating growth in our business and as we see the results of our cost reduction initiatives that began in the amount of employee stock based compensation expense we record in a given period depends primarily on the number of shares subject to outstanding options and the valuation criteria used at the time of the grant 
the amount of expense is also impacted by the accelerated method we use to expense these options and by forfeitures of non vested options 
our employee non cash stock based compensation expense may increase in future periods if we issue additional equity based instruments 
interest expense 
we incur interest on our credit facility at variable rates 
since  we have hedged the risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts 
while in effect  our original interest rate swap contracts maintained an effective interest rate of approximately 
in december  in response to interest rates falling to historically low levels  we settled our original interest rate swap contracts and entered into new interest rate swap contracts 
our new effective interest rate and actual cash payments for interest under these hedges will be approximately and the swap contracts expire in june over the next six quarters our reported interest rate will be higher than that reported in recent quarters due to the amortization of losses from our original swap contracts 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a fiscal period 
the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgment and estimates about matters that are uncertain use of estimates  stock based compensation  
table of contents purchase accounting and long lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets  income taxes  and derivative accounting 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
see risk factors for certain matters that may affect our financial condition or future results of operations 
use of estimates on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates relating to the items described below 
we generally base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable along with the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
accounts receivable allowance 
we monitor customer payments and the aging of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make required payments 
in estimating the reserve  we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable from a specific customer when we become aware of circumstances that may impair the customer s ability to meet its financial obligations and record an allowance against amounts due 
we believe that the potential aggregate amount of nonpayment by our customers is limited in part by the frequency of our billing cycle and the ease with which we may discontinue service to customers during periods of nonpayment 
however  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates due to the difficulty in predicting the future payment practices and ability of our customers 
as of december  and  we had reserved million and million  respectively  for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of the collectibility of outstanding receivables as of that date 
loss contingency for medical liability claims 
we record a loss contingency for a medical liability claim at the time we deem such liability to be probable 
our determination of the probability of the liability is based upon a review of the claim by our internal legal counsel  external legal counsel and medical liability insurance carrier 
upon the determination that a liability is probable  we record a loss contingency for the potential claim up to the amount of the deductible specified in our medical liability insurance policy 
actual future losses from medical liability claims may differ from our estimates to the extent that we suffer an adverse determination for a claim that we did not deem the liability probable  did not record a loss contingency up to the maximum amount of our insurance deductible  the loss was in excess of our coverage limits  or do not have insurance coverage or indemnification rights 
incurred but not reported claims 
we use actuarial assumptions to estimate and record a liability for ibnr professional liability claims 
our estimated ibnr liability is based on long term industry trends and averages  and considers a number of factors  including changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial and legislative decisions  and economic conditions 
our estimated ibnr liability will fluctuate as claims experience and volumes change over time 
stock based compensation physician stock based compensation 
we record stock based compensation expense in connection with any equity instrument awarded to our affiliated radiologists in accordance with eitf we calculate the stock based compensation expense related to such issuance by determining the then current fair value of the award using a black scholes model at the date of grant and at the end of each subsequent financial reporting period thereafter when service is delivered 
physician stock based compensation expense is included in professional services expense 

table of contents non physician stock based compensation 
we also record stock based compensation expense in connection with any grant of stock options  restricted stock units  warrants or other issuance of shares of common stock to employees and directors 
we calculate the stock based compensation expense associated with the issuance of stock options and warrants to our employees and directors in accordance with sfas r by determining the fair value using a black scholes model 
we calculate the stock based compensation expense related to the issuance of restricted stock units or shares of our common stock to our employees and directors based on the fair value of our common stock on the date the restricted stock units or shares are issued 
stock based compensation to employees and directors is included in sales  general and administrative expense 
determination of fair value of our stock options 
to determine the fair value of our stock options  we use a black scholes model which takes into account the exercise price of the stock option  the fair value of the common stock underlying the stock option  as measured on the date of grant or at each reporting date for grants to non employees that require future service  expected dividends  risk free interest rates  expected term and an estimation of the volatility of the common stock underlying the stock option 
purchase accounting and long lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets all of our acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as prescribed in sfas no 
 as amended  business combinations sfas 
accordingly  purchase accounting adjustments have been reflected in our financial statements for all periods subsequent to the respective purchase dates 
the purchase accounting entries are reflected on our financial statements as of the purchase date 
in accordance with sfas  we have revalued the assets and liabilities acquired as part of the acquisitions of mps  ers  radlinx  tds  and atn at their respective fair values 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  we do not amortize goodwill 
certain intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill and unamortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the goodwill and intangible assets might be impaired 
amortized other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of intangible and long lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or that the remaining estimated useful life should be changed 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
fas  accounting for income taxes 
this standard requires  among other things  the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 
such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which requires that we recognize only the impact of tax positions that  based on their technical merits  are more likely than not to be sustained upon an audit by the taxing authority 
fin also specifies standards for estimating and recognizing interest income and expense associated with the tax positions 
developing our provision for income taxes  including our effective tax rate and analysis of potential tax exposure items  if any  requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any estimated valuation allowances we deem necessary to value deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax 
table of contents liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
derivative accounting in accordance with us gaap  we recognize all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
we designate at inception whether the derivative contract is considered hedging or non hedging in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
if the derivative qualifies and is designated as a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in its fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
since  we have utilized interest rate swap contracts to maintain compliance with debt requirements and to protect us against changes in the interest payments associated with its variable rate long term debt 
the contracts are considered cash flow hedges 
as a result  as long as the swaps are deemed highly effective  changes in the fair value of the swaps are recorded as either an asset a gain position  or a liability a loss position on the balance sheet  with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity

liquidity and capital resources the discussion below highlights significant aspects of our capital resources and cash flow activities in millions 
december  december  capital resources cash and cash equivalents marketable securities total december  december  cash flow activities net cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities since our inception in august  we have funded our operations primarily from cash flows generated by our operating activities  the issuance of stock and the incurrence of debt 
net cash provided by operating activities in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we generated net cash from operations of million from net income of million 
significant non cash charges included in net income that did not impact our net cash from operations during this period include depreciation and amortization of million and stock compensation expense of million 
for the year ended december   we generated net cash from operations of million from net income of million 
significant non cash charges included in net income that did not impact our net cash from operations during this period include depreciation and amortization of million and stock compensation expense of million 
the changes in our operating assets and liabilities  net of acquired balances  and the associated impacts on our net cash from operations during the year ended december  as compared to the changes during the year ended december  are primarily due to the change in accounts receivable 
in  accounts receivable increased million due to an absolute increase in our total revenue due to growth and acquisition 
in  although our revenue increased over prior years  our accounts receivable dropped million due to increased collection efforts and improved customer management 
prepaid  accounts payable and accrued balances also changed mostly due to the timing of cash payments to vendors and for payroll 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales and maturities of marketable securities of million and million  respectively 
partially offsetting this increase was an earn out payment to the 
table of contents former radlinx owners of million  an escrow payment to the former tds owners of million  capital spending of million  and purchases of marketable securities of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used by investing activities was primarily attributable to the use of million for the acquisition of tds  million for the acquisition of radlinx and million for the acquisitions of mps and ers 
investment activity during included the purchase of million in marketable securities  offset by cash receipts of million as a result of certain investments reaching maturity during the period 
we also invested million in property and equipment during the majority of these capital expenditures were associated with computer equipment and the continued investment in our information technology infrastructure 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  the use of funds was primarily attributable to our effort to optimize our capitalization through repurchases of our common stock of million  a principal payment of million on our term loan in december  and the early settlement of our interest rate swap contracts of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  on april   we entered into a term loan in the amount of million to acquire radlinx 
immediately following the acquisition of radlinx  we paid in full million in assumed notes payable and lines of credit 
in july  we amended the credit facility and increased the loan to million as part of the financing for the mps and ers acquisitions 
we also incurred million in deferred financing costs 
the remaining net cash provided by financing activities was attributable to the cash proceeds to us from the exercise of stock options 
financial condition and liquidity we expect our short and long term liquidity needs to consist primarily of working capital  capital expenditures and any future acquisitions 
we may also have liquidity needs arising from any repurchases of shares of our common stock and if we make additional principal repayments under our term loan agreement 
finally  our term loan is subject to mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances  including in connection with the company s receipt of proceeds from certain issuances of equity or debt  sales of assets and casualty events and excess cash flow  which if triggered would require additional principal payment 
we intend to fund future liquidity needs from current capital resources and cash generated from operations 
in late  we sold all of our marketable securities and reinvested the proceeds in short term money market accounts as a conservative measure against the unfavorable conditions in the credit market and to better ensure access and recoverability of our cash investments 
we believe our capital resources are invested in appropriate investments and will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements our sydney and san francisco office leases and our medical liability insurance policy are collateralized by letters of credit totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk during the periods covered by this annual report  substantially all of our customers are in the united states and this revenue is denominated in us dollars 
although some of our affiliated radiologists work from our centralized reading facilities in australia and switzerland  the professional service fees we pay to our affiliated radiologists are denominated primarily in us dollars 
as a result  only our support personnel and facility costs in those countries present foreign currency exchange risks 
because we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange risk  we have not  to date  entered into any hedging contracts 
if a weakening us dollar requires us to increase the amounts we pay to our affiliated radiologists in the future in order to maintain a 
table of contents constant level of compensation  our results of operations and cash flows could be affected 
currently  any foreign exchange risks are related to the foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the australian dollar and between the us dollar and the swiss franc 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million at december  these amounts were invested primarily in interest bearing money market accounts and are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
however  any declines in interest rates will reduce future investment income 
as of december   we had million in variable interest rate debt 
because of the interest rate swap contracts in place at december  such debt will not be subject to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates until such contracts expire on june  for more information on our hedging activities  see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item
