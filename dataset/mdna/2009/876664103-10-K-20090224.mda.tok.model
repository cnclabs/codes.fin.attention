item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following md a contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following statements regarding future developments and joint ventures  rents  returns  and earnings  statements regarding the continuation of trends  and any statements regarding the sufficiency of our cash balances and cash generated from operating  investing  and financing activities for our future liquidity and capital resource needs 
we caution that although forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs and best judgment based upon current information  these statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  because of risks  uncertainties  and factors including  but not limited  to the ongoing us recession  the existing global credit and financial crisis and other changes in general economic and real estate conditions  changes in the interest rate environment and the availability of financing  and adverse changes in the retail industry 
other risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed with the sec  and in particular those set forth under risk factors of this annual report on form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of taubman centers  inc and the notes thereto 
general background and performance measurement taubman centers  inc tco is a michigan corporation that operates as a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust reit 
the taubman realty group limited partnership the operating partnership or trg is a majority owned partnership subsidiary of tco  which owns direct or indirect interests in all of our real estate properties 
in this report  the terms we  us  and our refer to tco  the operating partnership  and or the operating partnership s subsidiaries as the context may require 
we own  lease  develop  acquire  dispose of  and operate regional and super regional shopping centers 
the consolidated businesses consist of shopping centers and entities that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreements  the taubman company llc manager  and taubman properties asia llc and its subsidiaries taubman asia 
in september  we acquired the interests of the owner of partridge creek see note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements 
prior to the acquisition  we consolidated the accounts of the owner of partridge creek  which qualified as a variable interest entity under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities for which the operating partnership was considered to be the primary beneficiary 
shopping centers owned through joint ventures that are not controlled by us but over which we have significant influence unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
references in this discussion to beneficial interest refer to our ownership or pro rata share of the item being discussed 
also  the operations of the shopping centers are often best understood by measuring their performance as a whole  without regard to our ownership interest 
consequently  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the consolidated businesses  the operations of the unconsolidated joint ventures are presented and discussed as a whole 
the comparability of information used in measuring performance is affected by the opening of partridge creek in october and the pier shops  which began opening in phases in june in april  we increased our ownership in the pier shops to see results of operations openings  expansions and renovations  and acquisitions 
the pier shops results of operations are included within the consolidated businesses beginning april  and within the unconsolidated joint ventures prior to the acquisition date 
the results of operations for the unconsolidated joint ventures include results of the pier shops 
the pier shops was excluded from all operating statistics in our investment in the pier shops represented an effective interest prior to the acquisition date  based on relative equity contributions 
additional comparable center statistics that exclude partridge creek and the pier shops are provided for and to present the performance of comparable centers in our continuing operations 
comparable centers are generally defined as centers that were owned and open for two years 
overall summary of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our primary source of revenue is from the leasing of space in our shopping centers 
generally these leases are long term  with our average lease term at approximately seven years  excluding temporary leases 
therefore general economic trends most directly impact our tenants sales and consequently their ability to perform under their existing lease agreements and expand into new locations as well as our ability to find new tenants for our shopping centers 

table of contents the real estate industry is facing very difficult times due to the current recession and tough retail environment 
the global credit and financial crisis has worsened in the fourth quarter and there is considerable uncertainty as to how severe the current downturn may be and how long it may continue 
we clearly expect a negative impact on our business in  and we expect that the economy will continue to strain the resources of our tenants and their customers 
retailers have had a tough fourth quarter and are looking at an uncertain in this environment  retailer capital spending has significantly decreased  and we expect that retailers will want to delay any openings into either or whenever possible 
in addition  a number of regional and national retailers have announced store closings or filed for bankruptcy 
during  of our tenants sought the protection of the bankruptcy laws  compared to in it is difficult to predict when the environment will improve 
we also saw the impact of the current financial crisis on our tenants sales 
our tenants reported a decrease in sales per square foot in the quarter over the same period in annual sales per square foot declined by to a level of per square foot for our comparable centers  which is higher than the average in for all regional shopping centers owned by public companies  and exceeded our results 
see mall tenant sales and center revenues 
average occupancy remained relatively flat during  however  we anticipate occupancy will decrease by approximately by year end  although it is likely the impact on income will be somewhat offset by a higher level of temporary tenant leasing in for all of  rents showed solid increases compared to the prior year 
in  we expect that average rents per square foot will be relatively flat in comparison to the rents we are able to achieve are affected by economic trends and tenants expectations thereof  as described under rental rates and occupancy 
the spread between rents on openings and closings may not be indicative of future periods  as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period 
mall tenant sales  occupancy levels and our resulting revenues are seasonal in nature see seasonality 
our analysis of our financial results begins under results of operations 
we describe the most recent center openings under results of operations openings  expansions and renovations  and acquisitions 
in  we acquired an additional interest in the pier shops 
we also describe the current status of our efforts to broaden our growth in asia see results of operations taubman asia 
we similarly have been very active in managing our balance sheet  completing refinancings of fair oaks and international plaza in early  as outlined under results of operations debt transactions 
an unfavorable court decision and the difficult economy drove our decisions to record impairment charges in the fourth quarter of of million and million related to our oyster bay project in the town of oyster bay  new york oyster bay project or oyster bay and our sarasota project  respectively see results of operations impairment charges 
we have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues  recoveries from tenants  and revenue from management  leasing  and development services 
we disclose our share of these sources of income under results of operations other income and provide certain guidance for included in other revenue are lease cancellation income  as well as other sources of revenue derived from our shopping centers  such as parking garage and sponsorship income 
other sources of income include interest income  gains on peripheral land sales  and in  gains related to discontinued hedges 
we then provide a discussion of our critical accounting policies  and the expected impact in of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
with all the preceding information as background  we then provide insight and explanations for variances in our financial results for   and under comparison of to and comparison of to 
as information useful to understanding our results  we have described the presentation of our minority interest  the presentation of certain interests in centers  and the reasons for our use of non gaap measures such as beneficial interest in ebitda and funds from operations ffo under results of operations presentation of operating results 
reconciliations from net income loss and net income loss allocable to common shareowners to these measures follow the annual comparisons 
our discussion of sources and uses of capital resources under liquidity and capital resources begins with a brief overview of current market conditions and our financial position 
we have no maturities on our current debt until fall  when three loans mature with principal amounts of million at and million at our beneficial share 
we then discuss our capital activities and transactions that occurred in analysis of specific operating  investing  and financing activities is then provided in more detail 

table of contents specific analysis of our fixed and floating rates and periods of interest rate risk exposure is provided under liquidity and capital resources beneficial interest in debt 
completing our analysis of our exposure to rates are the effects of changes in interest rates on our cash flows and fair values of debt contained under liquidity and capital resources sensitivity analysis 
also see liquidity and capital resources loan commitments and guarantees for discussion of compliance with debt covenants 
in conducting our business  we enter into various contractual obligations  including those for debt  capital leases for property improvements  operating leases for land and office space  purchase obligations  and other long term commitments 
detail of these obligations  including expected settlement periods  is contained under liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations 
property level debt represents the largest single class of obligations 
described under liquidity and capital resources loan commitments and guarantees and liquidity and capital resources cash tender agreement are our significant guarantees and commitments 
development of new malls and renovation and expansion of existing malls has been a significant use of our capital  as described in liquidity and capital resources capital spending and liquidity and capital resources capital spending planned capital spending 
spending in the last two years includes construction of partridge creek and the pier shops  the expansion and renovation of twelve oaks  the expansion at stamford  our oyster bay project  and other development activities and capital items 
however  with our sarasota project on hold and the continued delays on our oyster bay and asia projects  we expect capital spending in to consist primarily of tenant allowances and other capital expenditures on our operating centers 
dividends and distributions are also significant uses of our capital resources 
the factors considered when determining the amount of our dividends  including requirements arising because of our status as a reit  are described under liquidity and capital resources dividends 
mall tenant sales and center revenues sales per square foot growth was positive during the first  second  and third quarters of  at   and  respectively 
sales began to decline in september  and the decline steepened during the fourth quarter  with the luxury and tourism centers experiencing the most negative impact from the slowdown 
during a time of such economic uncertainty  the consumer clearly moderated spending as the fourth quarter of progressed  and we reported our first quarterly decrease in tenant sales in over five years 
for our sales decreased to a level of per square foot 
sales per square foot decreased by in the fourth quarter 
over the long term  the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately of these revenues and because mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent  and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that mall tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs  and may be impacted significantly  either positively or negatively  by the success or lack of success of a small number of tenants or even a single tenant 
we believe that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
sales directly impact the amount of percentage rents certain tenants and anchors pay 
the effects of increases or declines in sales on our operations are moderated by the relatively minor share of total rents that percentage rents represent of total rents approximately in while sales are critical over the long term  the high quality regional mall business has been a very stable business model with its diversity of income from thousands of tenants  its staggered lease maturities  and high proportion of fixed rent 
however  a sustained trend in sales does impact  either negatively or positively  our ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates 
in the current environment  we are finding that negotiations are tougher 
while retailers continue to recognize the need to position themselves for the future  on the other end of the spectrum there is an increase in bankruptcies see rental rates and occupancy 

table of contents the following table summarizes occupancy costs  excluding utilities  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales mall tenant sales in thousands of dollars sales per square foot consolidated businesses minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales unconsolidated joint ventures minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales sales per square foot is presented for the comparable centers  including value centers 
in  mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales increased due to the decline in sales during the year  as well as due to increases in minimum rents and expense recoveries 
rental rates and occupancy as leases have expired in the centers  we have generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
generally  center revenues have increased as older leases rolled over or were terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that were usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
in periods of increasing sales  rents on new leases will generally tend to rise 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  as we are experiencing now  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason  as tenants expectations of future growth become less optimistic

mall tenant leased space  ending occupancy  and average occupancy rates are as follows all centers leased space ending occupancy average occupancy comparable centers leased space ending occupancy average occupancy ending occupancy was  a decrease from in this decline is largely due to three big box anchor store locations  which are part of national bankruptcies  that closed late in at our value centers 
at  leased space is over the year end occupancy level  indicating a backlog of tenants who have committed to opening stores in the future 
we expect occupancy to be down about by year end in this environment  capital spending is down and retailers are expected to delay openings into and we have executed of our leasing plan for  which is in line with our history 
however  we are concerned it will be difficult to execute new leases and open additional stores 
in addition  we expect unscheduled terminations  including bankruptcies  to increase in it is likely the impact on income will be somewhat offset by a higher level of temporary tenant leasing in temporary tenants  defined as those with lease terms less than months  are not included in occupancy or leased space statistics 
as of december   approximately of space was occupied by temporary tenants 
tenant bankruptcy filings as a percentage of the total number of tenant leases in  compared to in  and in seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school period 
while minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
additionally  most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter

the remaining interest continues to be held by an affiliate of gordon 
we began consolidating the pier shops as of the april purchase date 
at closing  we made a million equity investment in the center  bringing our total equity investment to million 
we are entitled to a cumulative preferred return on our million total investment  including our million share of debt see debt transactions 
we will be responsible for any additional capital requirements  on which we will receive a preferred return at a minimum of

taubman asia in february  taubman asia entered into agreements to acquire a interest in the mall at studio city  the retail component of macao studio city  a major mixed use project on the cotai strip in macao  china 
in addition  taubman asia entered into long term agreements to perform development  management  and leasing services for the shopping center 
macao is a project that has been clearly impacted by the financial crisis 
it is on hold until financing can be arranged  the timing of which is very uncertain 
there continues to be retailer interest in macao  but the project is unlikely to move forward in 
table of contents in august  our macao agreements will terminate and our million initial cash payment  which is in escrow  will be returned to us if the financing for the project is not completed 
no interest is being capitalized on this payment 
excluding the million initial refundable deposit  we had capitalized costs of million on the macao project as of december  offsetting these costs  we received a million non refundable development fee payment in october from the owner of the macao project  which was recorded as deferred revenue 
we began expensing costs relating to the project in the third quarter of in  we entered into an agreement to provide development services for a million square foot retail and entertainment complex in songdo international business district songdo  incheon  south korea 
we also finalized an agreement to provide management and leasing services for the retail component  and we continue to provide services as the regional mall progresses 
the shopping center will be anchored by lotte department store  tesco homeplus  and a nine screen megabox multiplex 
progress has been made on the mall infrastructure and parking 
we will not make a final determination about an investment in this center until full financing is completed 
debt transactions we completed a series of debt financings in the three year period ended december   as follows date initial loan balance facility stated interest rate maturity date in millions of dollars fair oaks april libor april international plaza january libor january trg revolving credit facility november libor february the pier shops at caesars april may taubman land associates sunvalley december libor november waterside shops september october the mall at partridge creek construction facility september libor september trg revolving credit facility august libor february cherry creek shopping center may june northlake mall february february excludes any options to extend the maturities see the footnotes to our financial statements regarding extension options

the loan is swapped at swap rate plus credit spread from january  through the term of the loan 
trg revolving credit facility was amended in november borrowings under trg s revolving credit facility are primary obligations of the entities owning dolphin  fairlane  and twelve oaks  which are collateral for the line of credit

impairment charges in january  the appellate division of the supreme court of the state of new york reversed the favorable order that we had been issued in june directing the town of oyster bay to immediately issue a special use permit for the mall at oyster bay 
the court also upheld the town board s request for a supplemental environmental impact statement 
although we intend to immediately seek an appeal of the decision  we determined in february that we would recognize in the fourth quarter of a charge to income of million relating to the oyster bay project  including million in costs for future expenditures associated with obligations under existing contracts related to the project 
this determination was reached after an overall assessment of the probability of the development of the mall as designed and a review of our previously capitalized project costs 
the charge includes the costs of previous development activities as well as holding and other costs that management believes will likely not benefit the development if and when we obtain the rights to build the center 
we also expect to expense any additional costs relating to oyster bay until it is probable that we will be able to successfully move forward with a project 
we began expensing carrying costs as incurred beginning in the fourth quarter of our remaining capitalized investment in the project as of december  is million  consisting of land and site improvements 
if we are ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining the right to build the center  it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the full amount of this capitalized investment through alternate uses of the land 
in may  we entered into agreements to jointly develop university town center  a regional mall in sarasota  florida 
under the agreements  we would own a noncontrolling interest in the project 
due to the current economic and retail environment  in december we announced that the project has been put on hold 
although we continue to believe it should be a very attractive opportunity longer term  we do not know if or when we will acquire an interest in the land and move forward with the project 
due to this uncertainty  we recognized an million charge to income in the fourth quarter of the charge to income represents our share of total project costs 
we have no asset remaining and expect to expense any additional costs related to the monitoring of the project until a definitive agreement is reached by the parties on going forward with the project 

table of contents other income we have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues  recoveries from tenants  and revenues from management  leasing  and development services  as summarized in the following table 
lease cancellation revenue is dependent on the overall economy and performance of particular retailers in specific locations and can vary significantly 
gains on peripheral land sales can also vary significantly from year to year  depending on the results of negotiations with tenants  counterparties  and potential purchasers of land  as well as the timing of the transactions 
in  we estimate our share of lease cancellation income to be approximately million to million 
in addition  due to current economic conditions  we would expect that certain shopping center related revenues that are based on month to month or shorter term contracts  primarily sponsorship and retail marketing units income  may decrease substantially in consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures operating partnership s share in millions of dollars other income shopping center related revenues lease cancellation revenue gains on land sales and other nonoperating income gains on sales of peripheral land interest income gains on discontinued hedges amounts in this table may not add due to rounding 
subsequent event in january  in response to a decreased level of active projects due to the downturn in the economy  we reduced our workforce by about positions  primarily in areas that directly or indirectly affect our development initiatives in the us and asia 
a restructuring charge of approximately million will be recorded in the first quarter of  which primarily represents the cost of terminations of personnel 
the majority of the restructuring costs will be paid during the first quarter of application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures 
some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult  subjective  and or complex judgment  often about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
we are required to make such estimates and assumptions when applying the following accounting policies 
valuation of shopping centers the viability of all projects under construction or development  including those owned by unconsolidated joint ventures  are regularly evaluated under applicable accounting requirements  including requirements relating to abandonment of assets or changes in use 
to the extent a project  or individual components of the project  are no longer considered to have value  the related capitalized costs are charged against operations 
additionally  all properties are reviewed for impairment on an individual basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment of a shopping center owned by consolidated entities is recognized when the sum of expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the property 
other than temporary impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is recognized when the carrying value is not considered recoverable based on evaluation of the severity and duration of the decline in value  including the results of discounted cash flow and other valuation techniques 
the expected cash flows of a shopping center are dependent on estimates and other factors subject to change  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  increases in operating costs  bankruptcy and or other changes in the condition of third parties  including anchors and tenants  expected holding period  and availability of credit 
these factors could cause our expected future cash flows from a shopping center to change  and  as a result  an impairment could be considered to have occurred 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the excess carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged to income 

table of contents in  we recognized impairment charges of million and million related to our oyster bay and sarasota projects  respectively see impairment charges 
there were no impairment charges recognized in or as of december   the consolidated net book value of our properties was billion  representing over of our consolidated assets 
we also have varying ownership percentages in the properties of unconsolidated joint ventures with a total combined net book value of billion 
these amounts include certain development costs that are described in the policy that follows 
capitalization of development costs in developing shopping centers  we typically obtain land or land options  zoning and regulatory approvals  anchor commitments  and financing arrangements during a process that may take several years and during which we may incur significant costs 
we capitalize all development costs once it is considered probable that a project will reach a successful conclusion 
prior to this time  we expense all costs relating to a potential development  including payroll  and include these costs in funds from operations see presentation of operating results 
on an ongoing basis  we continue to assess the probability of a project going forward and whether the asset is impaired 
in addition  we also assess whether there are sufficient substantive development activities in a given period to support the capitalization of carrying costs  including interest capitalization  in that period 
many factors in the development of a shopping center are beyond our control  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  availability and cost of financing  changes in regulations  laws  and zoning  and decisions made by third parties  including anchors 
these factors could cause our assessment of the probability of a development project reaching a successful conclusion to change 
if a project subsequently was considered less than probable of reaching a successful conclusion  a charge against operations for previously capitalized development costs would occur 
our million balance of development pre construction costs as of december  consists primarily of approximately million of costs relating to our oyster bay project  as described above 
the balance also includes approximately million of land and improvement costs for a parcel in north atlanta  georgia  which was acquired for future development 
a portion of this land is expected to be sold for various uses 
see impairment charges regarding the status of the oyster bay project and others 
valuation of accounts and notes receivable rents and expense recoveries from tenants are our principal source of income  they represent over of our revenues 
in generating this income  we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants 
the collectibility of tenant receivables is affected by bankruptcies  changes in the economy  and the ability of the tenants to perform under the terms of their lease agreements 
while we estimate potentially uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income  actual experience may differ from those estimates 
also  if a tenant were not able to perform under the terms of its lease agreement  receivable balances not previously provided for may be required to be charged against operations 
bad debt expense was less than of total revenues in  while bankruptcy filings affected of tenant leases during the year 
since  the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable has been less than of annual revenues 
notes receivable at december  totaled million  of which million relates to notes receivable from three tenants with common ownership that became delinquent during the third quarter the notes are guaranteed by affiliates of the tenants  and we expect to recover the remaining million net book value 
in addition  million of the total notes receivable balance related to the sale of residual land 
this land contract receivable is currently in default 
the fair value of the land that serves as collateral is at least equal to the book value of the receivable 
valuation of delinquent notes receivable are dependent on management s estimates of the collectibility of contractual principal and interest payments  which are inherently judgmental 

table of contents valuation of deferred tax assets our taxable reit subsidiaries trss currently have deferred tax assets  reflecting net operating loss carryforwards and the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the bases of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws 
our temporary differences primarily relate to deferred compensation and depreciation 
we reduce our deferred tax assets through valuation allowances to the amount where realization is more likely than not assured  considering all available evidence  including expected future taxable earnings and potential tax planning strategies 
expected future taxable earnings and the implementation of tax planning strategies require certain significant judgments and estimates  including those relating to our management company s profitability  the timing and amounts of gains on land sales  the profitability of our asian operations  and other factors affecting the results of operations of our trss 
changes in any of these factors could cause our estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets to change materially 
in july  the state of michigan signed into law the michigan business tax act  replacing the michigan single business tax with a business income tax and modified gross receipts tax 
these new taxes became effective on january   and are subject to the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
as of december   we had a net federal and foreign deferred tax asset of million  after a valuation allowance of million 
valuations for acquired property and intangibles upon acquisition of an investment property  including that of an additional interest in an asset already partially owned  we make an assessment of the valuation and composition of assets and liabilities acquired 
these assessments consider fair values of the respective assets and liabilities and are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount and capitalization rates and other commonly accepted valuation techniques 
the estimated future cash flows that are used for this analysis reflect the historical operations of the property  known trends and changes expected in current market and economic conditions which would impact the property s operations  and our plans for such property 
these estimates of cash flows and valuations are particularly important given the application of fasb statement nos 
and for the allocation of purchase price between land  building and improvements  and other identifiable intangibles 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
this statement amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest previously referred to as a minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
statement no 
generally requires noncontrolling interests to be treated as a separate component of equity not as a liability or other item outside of permanent equity and consolidated net income and comprehensive income to include the noncontrolling interest s share 
the calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent 
statement no 
also establishes a single method of accounting for transactions that change a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary by requiring that all such transactions be accounted for as equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest in the subsidiary 
the statement also amends certain of arb s consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of fasb statement no 
revised business combinations and eliminates the requirement to apply purchase accounting to a parent s acquisition of noncontrolling ownership interests in a subsidiary 
statement no 
is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  except for certain presentation and disclosure requirements  statement no 
will be applied on a prospective basis

upon our adoption of statement no 
on january   the noncontrolling interests in the operating partnership and certain consolidated joint ventures will no longer need to be carried at zero balances in our balance sheet 
as a result  the income allocated to these noncontrolling interests will no longer be required to be equal to their share of distributions  which will result in a material increase to tco s net income

because the net equity balances of the operating partnership and the outside partners in certain consolidated joint ventures are less than zero  the income allocated to these minority and outside partners is equal to their share of operating distributions see new accounting pronouncements regarding changes to the accounting for minority interests 
the net equity of these minority and outside partners is less than zero due to accumulated distributions in excess of net income and not as a result of operating losses 
distributions to partners are usually greater than net income because net income includes non cash charges for depreciation and amortization 
our average ownership percentage of the operating partnership was in  in  and in the results of the pier shops are presented within the consolidated businesses for periods beginning april   as a result of our acquisition of a controlling interest in the center 
prior to the acquisition date  the results of the pier shops are included within the unconsolidated joint ventures 
use of non gaap measures the operating results in the following table include the supplemental earnings measures of beneficial interest in ebitda and funds from operations ffo 
beneficial interest in ebitda represents our share of the earnings before interest  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization of our consolidated and unconsolidated businesses 
we believe beneficial interest in ebitda provides a useful indicator of operating performance  as it is customary in the real estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected by capital structure 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we believe that ffo is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  we and most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful in evaluating the operating performance of reits 
we primarily use ffo in measuring performance and in formulating corporate goals and compensation 
our presentations of beneficial interest in ebitda and ffo are not necessarily comparable to the similarly titled measures of other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the same definitions 
these measures should not be considered alternatives to net income loss or as an indicator of our operating performance 
additionally  neither represents cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
reconciliations of net income loss allocable to common shareowners to funds from operations and net income loss to beneficial interest in ebitda are presented following the comparison of to

dividends we pay regular quarterly dividends to our common and series g and series h preferred shareowners 
dividends to our common shareowners are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on the cash available to us  our financial condition  capital and other requirements  and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
to qualify as a reit  we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income prior to net capital gains to our shareowners  as well as meet certain other requirements 
we must pay these distributions in the taxable year the income is recognized  or in the following taxable year if they are declared during the last three months of the taxable year  payable to shareowners of record on a specified date during such period and paid during january of the following year 
such distributions are treated as paid by us and received by our shareowners on december of the year in which they are declared 
in addition  at our election  a distribution for a taxable year may be declared in the following taxable year if it is declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration 
these distributions qualify as dividends paid for the reit distribution test for the previous year and are taxable to holders of our capital stock in the year in which paid 
preferred dividends accrue regardless of whether earnings  cash availability  or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends 
the annual determination of our common dividends is based on anticipated funds from operations available after preferred dividends and our reit taxable income  as well as assessments of annual capital spending  financing considerations  and other appropriate factors 
any inability of the operating partnership or its joint ventures to secure financing as required to fund maturing debts  capital expenditures and changes in working capital  including development activities and expansions  may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such obligations  thereby possibly reducing distributions to partners of the operating partnership and funds available to us for the payment of dividends
