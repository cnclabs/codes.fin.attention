proven acquisition track record 
over the last fifteen years we have developed an acquisition program that has resulted in the acquisition of four significant businesses 
in october  we acquired rd  a solar and semiconductor automation company located near montpellier  france 
we believe the acquisition of the technology and business of rd enhances our growth strategy by allowing us to increase our sales by offering an integrated system under the tempress brand to the solar industry 
in july  we acquired the bruce technologies line of semiconductor horizontal furnace operations  product lines and other assets from hitachi kokusai  a wholly owned subsidiary of hitachi  japan and its affiliate  kokusai electric europe  gmbh 
bruce technologies has a large installed base  including several large semiconductor manufacturers 
in july  we acquired substantially all of the assets of pr hoffman 
this acquisition enabled us to offer new consumable products  including lapping and polishing carriers  polishing templates  lapping and polishing machines and related consumable and spare parts to our existing customer base as well as to target new customers 
in  we acquired certain assets of tempress and hired tempress s engineers to develop our first models of the tempress horizontal diffusion furnaces for production in the netherlands 
technical expertise 
we have highly trained and experienced mechanical  chemical  environmental  electronic  hardware and software engineers and support personnel 
our engineering group possesses core competencies in product applications and support systems  automation  sophisticated controls  chemical vapor deposition  diffusion and pyrogenic processes  robotics  vacuum systems  ultra clean applications and software driven control packages

leading technology solutions and new product development 
we pursue a partnering based approach  in which our engineering and development teams work closely with our customers to ensure our products are tailored to meet our customers specific requirements 
we believe this approach enables us to more closely align ourselves with our customers and provide them with superior systems 
we believe our line of horizontal diffusion furnaces  which allow high wafer per hour throughput  is more technologically advanced and reliable than most of our competitors equipment 
in addition  the processing and temperature control systems within the furnace provide diverse and proven process capabilities  which enable the application of high quality films onto silicon wafers 
we believe our recently acquired rd solar automation technology will provide efficiencies in the manufacturing process that will allow our customers to be more competitive in their respective markets 
additionally  our license agreements in the areas of psg dry etch and pecvd anti reflective coatings allows us to expand our solar product offering 
we developed a small batch vertical furnace jointly with a major european semiconductor customer and are currently developing multiple thin film processes for use with this furnace 
we retain full ownership of this technology 
in  we also began selling precision thickness wafer carriers 
this is an internally developed product that we expect will increase our sales to the wafer carrier market 
growth strategy capitalizing on growth opportunities in the solar industry 
we have had success in penetrating the solar market 
our orders for solar diffusion and automation systems in fiscal totaled million despite the severe worldwide economic downturn 
our fiscal solar orders totaled million compared to million in fiscal we believe that our success with solar cell manufacturers is due to our focused process and product development and marketing efforts  as well as the growing overall demand from the solar industry 
we believe that long term growth in the solar industry will be driven by rising energy demand  the increasing scarcity of traditional energy resources coupled with rising prices  the growing adoption of government incentives for solar energy due to increasing environmental awareness and concern about energy independence  the gradually decreasing cost of solar energy and the changing consumer preferences toward renewable energy sources 
accelerating new product and technology development 
we are focused on acquiring  developing and licensing new products across our business in response to customer needs in various markets 
leveraging our installed base 
we intend to continue leveraging our relationships with our customers to maximize parts  system  service and retrofit revenue from the large installed base of bruce technologies and tempress brand horizontal diffusion furnaces 
we intend to accomplish this by meeting these customers needs for replacement systems and additional capacity  including equipment and services in connection with any of our customers relocation to  or expansion efforts in  asia 
pursuing strategic acquisitions that complement our strong platform 
over the last twelve years  we have developed an acquisition program and have completed the acquisition of three significant businesses 
based on a disciplined acquisition strategy  we continue to evaluate potential technology  product and business acquisitions or joint ventures that are intended to increase our existing market share in the solar industry and expand the number of front end semiconductor processes addressed by our products 
in evaluating these opportunities  our objectives include enhancing our earnings and cash flows  adding complementary product offerings  expanding our geographic footprint  improving our production efficiency and growing our customer base 
solar and semiconductor industries we provide products and services primarily to two industries the solar industry and the semiconductor industry 
solar industry 
solar power has emerged as one of the most rapidly growing renewable energy sources 
to date  various technologies have been developed to harness solar energy 
the most significant technology is the use of interconnected photovoltaic  or pv  cells to generate electricity directly from sunlight 
most pv cells are constructed using specially processed silicon  which  when exposed to sunlight  generates direct current electricity 
solar energy has many advantages over other existing renewable energy sources and traditional non renewable energy sources in the areas of environmental impact  delivery risk  distributed nature of generation and matching of peak generation with demand 
semiconductor industry 
semiconductors control and amplify electrical signals and are used in a broad range of electronic products  including consumer electronic products  computers  wireless telecommunication devices  communications equipment  automotive electronic products  major home appliances  industrial automation and control systems  robotics  aircraft  space vehicles  automatic controls and high speed switches for broadband fiber optic telecommunication networks 
semiconductors  or semiconductor chips and optical components are manufactured primarily on a silicon wafer and are part of the circuitry or electronic components of many of the products listed above 
the semiconductor industry has experienced significant growth since the early s 
this growth has been primarily attributable to an increase in demand for personal computers  the growth of the internet  the expansion of the telecommunications industry  especially wireless communications  and the emergence of new applications in consumer electronics 
further fueling this growth is the rapidly expanding end user demand for smaller  less expensive and better performing electronic products as well as for traditional products with more intelligence 
this growing demand has led to an increased number of semiconductor devices in electronic and other consumer products  including automobiles 
although the semiconductor market has experienced significant growth over the past fifteen years  it remains cyclical by nature 
the market is characterized by short term periods of under or over supply for most semiconductors  including microprocessors  memory  power management chips and other logic devices 
when demand decreases  semiconductor manufacturers typically slow their purchasing of capital equipment 
conversely  when demand increases  so does capital spending 
industry manufacturing processes solar cell manufacturing process flow chart 
amtech kxxjpg 
manufacturing process step which involves the use of our products 
a part of our growth strategy involves evaluating opportunities to increase the number of process steps we serve in both the solar cell and semiconductor manufacturing processes by acquiring additional product lines 
the solar industry uses many similar process steps used in semiconductor manufacturing in the high volume production of solar cells including inspecting for resistivity and mechanical integrity and splitting wafers  etching away saw damage with sodium hydroxide and rinsing the wafer with water and concentrated sulphuric acid  diffusing phosphorous oxychloride on the wafer  etching the wafer with hydrofluoric acid to remove the undiffused  phosphorus silica glass layer  coating an antireflective layer through a chemical vapor deposition cvd or plasma enhanced cvd process  printing rear side contacts  drying to prevent condensation in the wafer area  printing aluminum and silver paste on the back surface field to prevent recombination of generated electrons and holes  drying  printing front side contacts  drying and then sintering the contact to form electrical conductive contacts  and testing and sorting the solar cells into electrical efficiency categories 
most solar cell manufacturers sell their products to manufacturers of solar modules or solar panels 
others are vertically integrated and use their cells in the production of solar modules and panels 
solar cells are the critical component of solar modules and solar panels  which are sold to the end user and used in residential homes  industrial applications  remote pumping  lighting and heating uses and central power stations 
semiconductor front end manufacturing process flow chart 
amtech kxxjpg 
manufacturing process steps which are performed using our products 
most semiconductor chips are built on a base of silicon  called a wafer  and include multiple layers of circuitry that connect a variety of circuit components  such as transistors  capacitors and other components 
to build a chip  the transistors  capacitors and other circuit components are first created on the surface of the wafer by performing a series of processes to deposit and remove selected film layers  including insulators 
similar processes are then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer 
these are all referred to as front end processes 
a simplified sequence of front end processes for fabricating typical chips involves forming an ingot by pulling molten silicon  slicing the silicon ingot into wafers of uniform thickness with a wire saw  lapping and polishing the silicon wafer to a mirror like finish  cleaning the wafer  forming a thin film layer of silicon dioxide on the wafer in a diffusion furnace where oxygen  hydrogen or a combination of the two is introduced to cause a chemical reaction oxidation with the silicon wafer s surface  diffusing impurities doping in order to change the wafer s electrical properties 
depositing insulating or conducting layers on the wafer surface  which sometimes is accomplished in a diffusion furnace via a chemical reaction called chemical vapor deposition  coating and baking a photosensitive material  called photoresist  on the wafer  creating circuit patterns by exposing the wafer to light directed through a mask with circuit patterns  removing the soluble portion of the photoresist by placing the wafer in a chemical solution  leaving only the desired pattern  etching away the exposed areas to create a dimensional pattern on the wafer surface  creating electrically charged conductive regions by driving ions into the exposed areas of the patterned wafer  and annealing the wafer through a high temperature process to relieve stress and drive the implanted ions deeper into the wafer 
the silicon wafer may be cycled ten to twenty five times through these wafer processing steps  starting each time at step or to form a number of chips on the wafer 
the front end process steps are followed by a number of back end steps in which the wafers are sliced into individual chips that are then packaged to add connectors that are compatible with the end product in which the chip will be used 
depending on the device  our polishing supplies segment s products may be used in lapping and polishing step and our solar and semiconductor equipment segment s products may be used in forming silicon dioxide films step  doping step  depositing insulating and conducting layers step and the annealing processes step 
solar and semiconductor equipment segment products our furnace and automation equipment is manufactured in our facilities in the netherlands  france  and massachusetts 
the following paragraphs describe the products that comprise our solar and semiconductor equipment segment horizontal diffusion furnaces 
through our subsidiaries  tempress and bruce technologies  we produce and sell horizontal diffusion furnaces 
our horizontal furnaces currently address several steps in the semiconductor manufacturing process  including diffusion step in the semiconductor manufacturing process previously described  phosphorus tetrachloride doping  or pocl step  low pressure chemical vapor deposition  or lpcvd  step  and annealing step 
our horizontal furnaces also currently address diffusion and applying antireflective coating in the solar cell manufacturing process steps and 
our horizontal furnaces generally consist of three large modules the load station where the loading of the wafers occurs  the furnace section  which is comprised of one to four reactor chambers  and the gas distribution cabinet where the flow of gases into the reactor chambers is controlled  and often customized to meet the requirements of a customer s particular processes 
the horizontal furnaces utilize existing industry technology and are sold primarily to customers who do not require the advanced automation of  or cannot justify the higher expense of  vertical furnaces for some or all of their diffusion processes 
our models are capable of processing all currently existing wafer sizes 
psg dry etch 
the psg dry etch process step in the manufacturing of solar cells removes phosphorus silicate glass psg that naturally occurs during the diffusion process 
we will use our license of this unique psg technology  which will be manufactured by pst  to expand our presence in the growing solar market 
plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition pecvd 
our new solar pecvd product applies an anti reflective coating to solar wafers  a coating critical to the efficiency of solar cells 
this solar product adds another solar cell processing step to amtech s offerings 
automation products solar 
our automation technology products are used in several of the semiconductor manufacturing steps and the diffusion processing step in solar cell manufacturing 
our automation equipment includes mass wafer transfer systems  sorters  long boat transfer systems  load station elevators  buffers and conveyers 
we use a vacuum technology for our solar wafer transfer systems designed to ensure high throughput 
automation products semiconductor 
use of our automation products reduces human handling and  therefore  reduces exposure of wafers to particle sources during the loading and unloading of the process tubes and protects operators from heat and chemical fumes 
the top reactor chamber of a horizontal furnace can be as much as eight feet from the floor on which the operator stands when manually loading wafer boats 
typical boats of mm to mm wafers weigh three to six pounds 
given these two factors  automating the wafer loading and unloading of a diffusion furnace improves employee safety and ergonomics in silicon wafer  solar cell and semiconductor manufacturing facilities 
s our patented s model provides a very efficient method of automatically transporting a full batch of up to wafers to the designated tube level and automatically placing them directly onto the cantilever loader of a diffusion furnace at one time 
this product is suitable for the production of nearly all semiconductors manufactured using a horizontal furnace 
the s can be used in conjunction with all current wafer sizes and is particularly well suited for manufacturers of mm wafers 
comet 
our comet and gemini series of wafer transfer systems include a wide range of throughputs and footprints to meet the needs of our customers who serve the semiconductor industry 
comet sorter with optical character recognition ocr is used in sorting  randomizing or compacting 
the comet sorter is a cassette to cassette with ocr front and back scribe functions  notch alignment and secsii communication 
comet id reader checks tag carriers then reads each wafer scribe 
the comet id reader sends the information to the host with secsii gem commands 
small batch vertical furnace 
our small batch  two tube vertical furnace was developed internally with the active support from a large semiconductor manufacturer and long term customer 
the specifications for this furnace include a two tube vertical furnace for wafer sizes of up to mm  with each tube having a small flat zone capable of processing wafers per run 
the market for vertical furnaces is much larger than the total of all the other markets we currently serve 
we are initially targeting niche applications  including research and development  while we continue to develop additional processes  since the competition in the large batch vertical furnace market is intense and our competitors are much larger and have substantially greater financial resources  processing knowledge and advanced technology 
conveyor furnace 
we produce conveyor furnaces used to manufacture thick films for the electronics industry 
conveyor furnaces provide for precision thermal processing of electronic parts for thick film applications  including annealing  sealing  soldering  silvering  curling  brazing  alloying  glass metal sealing and component packaging 
polishing supplies segment products the products of our polishing supplies segment are used primarily for lapping and polishing raw silicon wafers to a mirror like finish 
depending on the cycle of the semiconductor industry  approximately two thirds of this segment s products are sold to either semiconductor wafer manufacturers or specialty semiconductor fabricators 
the products of our polishing supplies segment are also sold to fabricators of optics  quartz  ceramics and metal parts  and to manufacturers of medical equipment components and computer disks 
we manufacture the products described below in pennsylvania and sell them under our pr hoffman brand name 
wafer carriers 
carriers are work holders into which silicon wafers or other materials are inserted for the purpose of holding them securely in place during the lapping and polishing processes 
we produce carriers for our line of lapping and polishing machines  as well as for those machines sold by our competitors 
substantially all of the carriers we produce are customized for specific applications 
insert carriers  our most significant category of carriers  contain plastic inserts molded onto the inside edge of the work holes of the carrier  which hold the wafers in place during processing 
although our standard steel carriers are preferred in many applications because of their durability  rigidity and precise dimensions  they are typically not suited for applications involving softer materials or when metal contamination is an issue 
insert carriers  however  are well suited for processing large semiconductor wafers  up to mm in diameter  and other fragile materials or where contamination is an issue  because they provide the advantages of steel carriers while reducing the potential for damage to the edges of such sensitive materials 
our insert carriers are used for double sided lapping or polishing of semiconductor wafers up to mm in diameter 
we internally developed and began selling precision thickness wafer carriers in semiconductor polishing templates 
our polishing templates are used to securely hold silicon wafers in place during single sided polishing processes 
polishing templates are customized for specific applications and are manufactured to exacting tolerances 
we manufacture polishing templates for most brands of tools and various processes 
in addition to silicon wafers  these products are used in polishing silicon carbide wafers and sapphire crystals used in leds 
double sided planetary lapping and polishing machines 
double sided lapping and polishing machines are designed to process thin and fragile materials  such as semiconductor silicon wafers  precision optics  computer disk media and ceramic components for wireless communication devices  to exact tolerances of thickness  flatness  parallelism and surface finish 
on average  we believe that we offer our surface processing systems at a lower price than systems offered by our competitors and target the semiconductor  optics  quartz  ceramics  medical  computer disk and metal working markets 
during fiscal  we introduced and delivered our first model lapping and polishing machine  capable of processing parts up to inches in diameter  including mm wafers and higher capacities of smaller parts 
this machine is our largest and is superior to our previous model  because it uses servo motors rather than hydraulics and is equipped with a windows touch screen interface  for better control of speeds and pressure  optional thickness control  and crash protection 
we believe our model is especially well suited for thin and fragile materials 
we also produce and sell a wide assortment of plates  gears  parts and wear items for our own machines and those sold by many of our competitors 
manufacturing  raw materials and supplies our solar and semiconductor equipment manufacturing activities consist primarily of engineering design  procurement and assembly of various commercial and proprietary components into finished diffusion furnace systems in vaassen  the netherlands  france  and billerica  massachusetts 
nearly all of our fabricated parts for the solar and semiconductor equipment segment are purchased from local suppliers 
our manufacturing activities in the polishing supplies and equipment segment include laser cutting and other fabrication steps in producing lapping and polishing consumables  including carriers  templates  gears  wear items and spare parts in carlisle  pennsylvania  from raw materials manufactured to our specifications by our suppliers 
many items  such as proprietary components for our solar and semiconductor equipment and lapping plates  are also purchased from suppliers who manufacture these items to our specifications 
all final assembly and tests of our equipment and machines are performed within our manufacturing facilities 
quality control is maintained through inspection of incoming materials and components  in process inspection during equipment assembly  testing of assemblies and final inspection and  when practical  operation of manufactured equipment prior to shipment 
since much of our polishing supplies segment s know how relates to the manufacture of its products  this segment s facility is equipped to perform a significantly higher percentage of the fabrication steps required in the production of its products 
however  injection molding for our insert carriers and the manufacture of raw cast iron plates are subcontracted out to various third parties 
our polishing supplies segment relies on key suppliers for certain materials  including two steel mills in germany and japan  an injection molder  a single sourced pad supplier from japan and an adhesive manufacturer 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  we subcontracted the laser cutting of carriers to third parties 
since then we have purchased an advanced laser cutting tool which has increased our ability to compete based upon price  delivery lead times and quality 
to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and or shortages of key parts  we maintain appropriate inventories of key raw materials and parts 
if for any reason we were unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of parts in a timely and cost effective manner to meet our production requirements  our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
research  development and engineering the markets we serve are characterized by evolving industry standards and rapid technological change 
to compete effectively in our markets  we must continually keep up with the pace of such change by improving our products and our process technologies and developing new technologies and products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and that adequately address current and future customer requirements 
we continue to obtain as much customer cooperation and input as possible to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our research and development efforts 
while there can be no assurance that such relationships will continue or that others will be developed  such cooperative efforts are expected to remain a significant element in our future product and technology development projects 
in april  we entered into a licensing and manufacturing agreement to develop and market an antireflective coating system for solar cells with pst co  ltd 
pst 
pst is a producer of vertical thermal processing systems for high end semiconductor applications 
this plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition pecvd system is used in high volume  solar cell manufacturing and is an important step in the solar cell manufacturing process 
the licensing agreement allows us to market pst s existing pecvd system  and for pst to develop and manufacture a new pecvd model for us to market to high volume solar cell manufacturers 
in june  we introduced the new pecvd system into the market 
in november  the company entered into a license agreement with pst to market pst s existing and future proprietary psg phosphorus silicate glass dry etch systems for the manufacture of photovoltaic cells 
we introduced the psg system into the market in july on april   the company entered into amendments with pst to both the psg license and the pecvd license to expand the licenses to include one future model of the psg dry etch systems and three future models of the pecvd system 
these year licensing agreements will enable us to sell this product to our solar customer base through our extensive global sales and marketing network on an exclusive basis  with the exception of sales in korea and to one existing customer of pst  for which pst retains exclusive rights 
additionally  we believe this product will enable us develop new customer relationships 
from time to time we add functionality to our products or develop new products during engineering and manufacturing to fulfill specifications in a customer s order  in which case the cost of development  along with other costs of the order  are charged to cost of sales 
we periodically receive small research grants for research and development of products in the netherlands  which are netted against our research and development costs 
our approach to such expenditures has allowed us to produce a number of new products while spending amounts that we believe are generally modest in relation to most semiconductor equipment manufacturers 
our expenditures that have been accounted for as research and development were million of net revenue for fiscal  million of net revenue for fiscal and million of net revenue for fiscal these amounts exclude expenses supported by government grants 
patents the following table shows our material patents  the patents licensed by us  and the expiration date of each patent and license product country expiration date or pending approval ibal model s france  march  germany  pending italy  pending the netherlands  pending united kingdom pending heating element wire spacer europe pending photo cvd united states november  potential damage free asher united states september  ibal model s united states july  ibal model s united states july  ibal model e united states july  fast  safe  pyrogenic external torch assembly united states december  lapping machine adjustable mechanism united states february  patent is licensed from the patent holder or co owner on a non exclusive basis 
to the best of our knowledge  there are no pending lawsuits against us regarding infringement of any existing patents or other intellectual property rights or any material unresolved claims made by third parties that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of such third parties 
sales and marketing because of the highly technical nature of our products  we market our products primarily by direct customer contact through our sales personnel and through a network of domestic and international independent sales representatives and distributors that specialize in semiconductor equipment and supplies 
our promotional activities include direct sales contacts  participation in trade shows  an internet website  advertising in trade magazines and the distribution of product brochures 
sales to distributors of both segments are generally on terms comparable to sales to end user customers  as our distributors generally quote their customers after first obtaining a quote from us and have an order from the end user before placing an order with us 
our sales to distributors are not contingent on their future sales and do not include a general right of return 
historically  returns have been rare 
distributors of our solar and semiconductor equipment segment products do not stock a significant amount of our products  as the inventory they do hold is primarily limited to parts needed to provide timely repairs to the customer 
payment terms of our parts  service and retrofit sales  which usually comprise approximately of consolidated net revenue  are generally net days  fob shipping point or equivalent terms 
the payment terms of equipment or systems sales vary depending on the size of the order and the size  reputation and creditworthiness of the customer 
as a result  the financial terms of equipment sales can range from due days after shipment and due days after acceptance  to requiring a customer deposit days after order placement  due days after shipment and net due days after acceptance 
letters of credit are required of certain customers depending on the size of the order  creditworthiness of the customer and the customers country of domicile 
during fiscal  of our net revenue came from customers outside of north america 
this group represented of revenues in fiscal in fiscal  net revenue was distributed among customers in different geographic regions as follows north america all of which is in the united states  asia including to china and to taiwan and europe 
during fiscal  and  one customer accounted for approximately   and of our net revenue  respectively 
e ton solar tech accounted for  and of our net revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
at the end of fiscal and  and of our total backlog consisted of orders and deferred revenue from e ton solar tech  respectively 
our business is not seasonal in nature  but is cyclical based on the capital equipment investment patterns of solar cell and semiconductor manufacturers 
these expenditure patterns are based on many factors  including anticipated demand for integrated circuits  the development of new technologies and global and regional economic conditions 
competition we compete in several distinct markets including semiconductor devices  semiconductor wafer  solar cell  mems and the market for general industrial lapping and polishing machines and supplies 
each of these markets is highly competitive 
our ability to compete depends on our ability to continually improve our products  processes and services  as well as our ability to develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements 
significant competitive factors for succeeding in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment market include the equipment s technical capability  productivity and cost effectiveness  overall reliability  ease of use and maintenance  contamination and defect control and the level of technical service and support provided by the vendor 
the importance of each of these factors varies depending on the specific customer s needs and criteria  including considerations such as the customer s process application  product requirements  timing of the purchase and particular circumstances of the purchasing decision 
the solar cell semiconductor devices  semiconductor wafer  and mems markets 
our diffusion furnaces and automation processing equipment primarily compete with those produced by other domestic and foreign original equipment manufacturers  some of which are well established firms that are much larger and have substantially greater financial resources than us 
some of our competitors have a diversified product line  making it difficult to quantify their sales of products that compete directly with our products 
competitors of our horizontal diffusion furnaces include centrotherm gmbh  koyo systems co 
ltd  mrl industries  inc  a subsidiary of sandvik ab  cvd equipment  inc  semco engineering sa  expertech  inc and tystar corporation 
competitors of our lapping and polishing machines and supplies include lapmaster international  llc  hamai co  ltd  speedfam co  ltd  onse  inc and eminess technologies  inc 
such competition could intensify in the future if the industry trend to produce smaller chips on larger wafers accelerates  or the newer technology represented by vertical furnaces results in a material shift in the purchasing habits of our targeted customers 
our furnaces and lapping and polishing machines also face  to a limited  but increasing extent  competition from used equipment on the low end of the price spectrum 
general industrial lapping and polishing machines and supplies market 
we experience price competition for wafer carriers produced by foreign manufacturers for which there is very little publicly available information 
as a result  we are intensifying our efforts to reduce the cost of our carriers and will continue to compete with other manufacturers of carriers by continuing to update our product line to keep pace with the rapid changes in our customers requirements and by providing a high level of quality and customer service 
during september  we completed the installation and began producing steel carriers  including insert carriers  on an advanced laser cutting tool  which has reduced the costs and lead times of these products and increased our control over quality 
competitors of our lapping and polishing machines and carriers  other than insert carriers  include speedfam pw  a division of novellus  among others 
we have been able to capture a small share of the semiconductor polishing template market  which we believe to be dominated by rodel  a division of rohm and haas 
our strategy to enhance our sales of wafer carriers includes developing additional niche markets for templates and providing a high level of customer support and products at a lower cost than our competitors 
employees as of september   we employed approximately people 
of these employees  approximately were based at our corporate offices in tempe  arizona  at our manufacturing plant in carlisle  pennsylvania  at our manufacturing plant in billerica  massachusetts  at our facilities in the netherlands  at our facilities in france and in our contract semiconductor manufacturing support services business located in austin  texas 
of the approximately people employed at our carlisle  pennsylvania facility  about were represented by the united auto workers union local we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike 
we consider our employee relations to be good

item a 
risk factors because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results and financial condition  past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
risks related to our business and industry 
recent deterioration in the global economy and credit markets may materially and adversely affect our future results of operations 
our operations may be adversely affected by the recent deterioration in the global economy causing our customers to delay or cease spending on our products 
the recent tightening of the credit markets may negatively impact our operations by affecting the liquidity and or solvency of our customers and key suppliers and the ability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products 
if the global economy and credit markets continue to deteriorate  our financial condition and results of operations will likely be adversely impacted 
we have no way of determining how long the global economic crisis  including the tightening of credit markets  will last 
if demand declines for horizontal diffusion furnaces and related equipment  or for solar industry products  our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the revenue of our solar and semiconductor equipment segment  which accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenue as of september   is comprised primarily of sales of horizontal diffusion furnaces and our automation products 
our automation products are useable only with horizontal diffusion furnaces 
there is a trend in the semiconductor industry  related to the trend to produce smaller chips on larger wafers  towards the use in semiconductor manufacturing facilities of newer technology  such as vertical diffusion furnaces 
vertical diffusion furnaces are more efficient than the horizontal diffusion furnaces in certain manufacturing processes for smaller chips on larger wafers 
as early as  we had expected that demand for our horizontal diffusion furnaces would decline as a result of this trend 
we believe this trend has not yet adversely affected us to the extent originally expected 
however  to the extent that the trend to use vertical diffusion furnaces over horizontal diffusion furnaces continues  our revenue may decline and our corresponding ability to generate income may be adversely affected 
a significant part of our growth strategy involves expanding our sales to the solar industry 
the solar industry is subject to risks relating to industry shortages of polysilicon  which we discuss further below  the continuation of government incentives  the availability of specialized capital equipment  global energy prices and rapidly changing technologies offering alternative energy sources 
if the demand for solar industry products declines  the demand by the solar industry for our products would also decline and our financial position and results of operations would be harmed 
we may not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate  and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively 
we may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage future growth 
our recent expansion has placed  and our planned expansion and any other future expansion will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  personnel  systems and resources 
in the past two years  we purchased additional equipment and real estate to significantly expand our manufacturing capacity and expect to hire additional employees to support an increase in manufacturing  research and development and sales and marketing efforts 
to successfully manage our growth  we believe we must effectively hire  train  integrate and manage additional process engineers  field service engineers  sales and marketing personnel  and financial and information technology personnel  retain key management and augment our management team  particularly if we lose key members  continue to enhance our customer resource management and manufacturing management systems  implement and improve additional and existing administrative  financial and operations systems  procedures and controls  expand and upgrade our technological capabilities  and manage multiple relationships with our customers  suppliers and other third parties 
we may encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting  forecasting and other process control issues presented by rapid growth 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  develop new solar cells and other products  satisfy customer requirements  execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures 
the ongoing volatility of the solar and semiconductor equipment industry may negatively impact our business and results of operations and our corresponding ability to efficiently budget our expenses 
the solar and semiconductor equipment industries are highly cyclical 
as such  demand for and the profitability of our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors  including  but not limited to  changes in global and regional economic conditions  changes in capacity utilization and production volume of manufacturers of semiconductors  silicon wafers  solar cells and mems  the shift of semiconductor production to asia  where there often is increased price competition  and the profitability and capital resources of those manufacturers 
for these and other reasons  our results of operations for past periods may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
since our business has historically been subject to cyclical industry conditions  we have experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly new orders and net revenue  both within and across years 
demand for solar semiconductor and silicon wafer manufacturing equipment and related consumable products has also been volatile as a result of sudden changes in solar and semiconductor supply and demand and other factors in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes 
our orders tend to be more volatile than our revenue  as any change in demand is reflected immediately in orders booked  which are net of cancellations  while revenue tends to be recognized over multiple quarters as a result of procurement and production lead times and the deferral of certain revenue under our revenue recognition policies 
customer delivery schedules on large system orders can also add to this volatility since we generally recognize revenue for new product sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse 
as a result  the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new products revenue is typically subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation  which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both their domestic markets and the worldwide semiconductor industry 
the timing  length and severity of the up and down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict 
the cyclical nature of our marketplace affects our ability to accurately budget our expense levels  which are based in part on our projections of future revenue 
when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels  operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound 
during a down cycle  we must be able to make timely adjustments to our cost and expense structure to correspond to the prevailing market conditions 
in addition  during periods of rapid growth  we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand  which may require additional liquidity 
we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to changes within the industry cycles 
our failure to respond to these cyclical changes could have a material adverse affect on our business 
during the most recent down cycle  beginning in the first half of  the semiconductor industry experienced excess production capacity that caused semiconductor manufacturers to decrease capital spending 
we do not have long term volume production contracts with our customers and we do not control the timing or volume of orders placed by our customers 
whether and to what extent our customers place orders for any specific products and the mix and quantities of products included in those orders are factors beyond our control 
insufficient orders would result in under utilization of our manufacturing facilities and infrastructure and will negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 
the company has made substantial investments in its organization to develop new products for the solar industry 
sales of our products to the solar industry are subject to substantial risks 
the solar energy sector is partially dependent upon governmental subsidies that are not guaranteed to continue 
a decline in these subsidies would reduce our ability to grow our business in this market 
the semiconductor equipment industry is competitive and we are relatively small in size and have fewer resources in comparison with our competitors 
our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide 
our future performance depends  in part  upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 
some of our competitors are diversified companies having substantially greater financial resources and more extensive research  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide 
we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products  some of which compete with the products and services that we offer 
these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products 
in addition  we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer at often a lower price than ours  using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets 
loss of competitive position could impair our prices  customer orders  revenue  gross margin and market share  any of which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 
our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business 
there is a risk that larger  better financed competitors will develop and market more advanced products than those that we currently offer  or that competitors with greater financial resources may decrease prices thereby putting us under financial pressure 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a negative impact on our revenue 
we are dependent on key personnel for our business and product development and sales  and any loss of our key personnel to competitors or other industries could dramatically impact our ability to continue operations 
historically  our product development has been accomplished through cooperative efforts with key customers 
our relationship with some customers is substantially dependent on personal relations established by our president and chief executive officer 
furthermore  our relationship with a major european customer that has been instrumental in the development of our small batch vertical furnace is substantially dependent upon our european general manager 
we are also dependent upon our technical director of rd for the development of our automation technology 
while there can be no assurance that such relationships will continue  such cooperation is expected to continue to be a significant element in our future development efforts thereby continuing our reliance on certain of our key personnel 
we are the beneficiary of life insurance policies on the life of our president and chief executive officer  mr 
j 
s 
whang  in the amount of million  but there is no assurance that such amount will be sufficient to cover the cost of finding and hiring a suitable replacement for mr 
whang 
it may not be feasible for any successor to maintain the same business relationships that mr 
whang has established 
if we were to lose the services of mr 
whang for any reason  it could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we also depend on the management efforts of our officers and other key personnel and on our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
during times of strong economic growth  competition is intense for highly skilled employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel or that we can avoid increased costs in order to do so 
there can be no assurance that employees will not leave amtech or compete against us 
our failure to attract additional qualified employees  or to retain the services of key personnel  could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
we may not be able to keep pace with the rapid change in the technology we use in our products 
success in the solar and semiconductor equipment industries depends  in part  on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions 
for example  the semiconductor industry continues to shrink the size of semiconductor devices 
these and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs 
technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing 
our future business success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products  or new uses for existing products  that successfully address changing customer needs  win market acceptance of these new products or uses and manufacture any new products in a timely and cost effective manner 
to realize future growth through technical innovations in the solar and semiconductor industries  we must either acquire the technology through merger and acquisition activity or through the licensing of products from our technology partners 
our failure to develop and introduce new products  technologies or uses for existing products in a timely manner and continually find ways of reducing the cost to produce them in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  could have a material adverse affect on our business 
acquisitions can result in an increase in our operating costs  divert management s attention away from other operational matters and expose us to other risks associated with acquisitions 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and consider acquisitions an important part of our future growth strategy 
in the past  we have made acquisitions of  or significant investments in  other businesses with synergistic products  services and technologies and plan to continue to do so in the future 
acquisitions  including our recent acquisition of rd  involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of geographically diverse personnel  operations  technologies and products of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies  lack of synergy  or inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  the risk that the issuance of our common stock  if any  in an acquisition or merger could be dilutive to our shareholders  if anticipated synergies are not realized  and acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance of the acquired company 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially harmed if we are unable to recoup our investment in research and development 
the rapid change in technology in our industry requires that we continue to make investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our products  to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance  features and functionality 
there can be no assurance that revenue from future products or enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements  or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future development 
research and development costs are typically incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product  and not all development activities result in commercially viable products 
in addition  we cannot ensure that products or enhancements will receive market acceptance  or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us 
if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices  or if our products are not accepted by the markets in which we operate  it could have a material adverse affect on our business 
if third parties violate our proprietary rights  in which we have made significant investments  such events could result in a loss of value of some of our intellectual property or costly litigation 
our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights 
we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies 
the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive  and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents  or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us 
other companies and individuals  including our larger competitors  may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents we own or license 
we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation 
however  we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 
recently  the patent covering technology that we license and use in our manufacture of insert carriers has expired  which may have the effect of diminishing or eliminating any competitive advantage we may have with respect to this manufacturing process 
while patent  copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important  we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers  suppliers  employees and consultants and through other security measures 
we also maintain exclusive and non exclusive licenses with third parties for the technology used in certain products 
however  these employees  consultants and third parties may breach these agreements  and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing 
in addition  the laws of certain territories in which we develop  manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time consuming and costly to defend and could result in our loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages 
from time to time  we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights or other intellectual property rights that they believe cover certain of our products  processes  technologies or information 
in such cases  we evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives  which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question on commercially reasonable terms or defending our position 
we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained  or if obtained will be on acceptable terms  or that litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur 
some of these claims may lead to litigation 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in these actions  or that other actions alleging misappropriation or misuse by us of third party trade secrets  infringement by us of third party patents and trademarks or the validity of our patents  will not be asserted or prosecuted against us 
intellectual property litigation  regardless of outcome  is expensive and time consuming  could divert management s attention from our business and have a material negative effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
if there is a successful claim of infringement against us  we may be required to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we were to be found to have willfully infringed a third party s patent to the party claiming infringement  develop non infringing technology  stop selling or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms  if at all 
our failure to develop non infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis could harm our business 
parties making infringement claims on future issued patents may be able to obtain an injunction that would prevent us from selling or using our technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property  which could harm our business 
our reliance on sales to a few major customers and granting credit to those customers places us at financial risk 
we currently sell to a relatively small number of customers  and we expect our operating results will likely continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers for the foreseeable future  as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that require our products in their manufacture 
during fiscal of net revenue was generated by one customer  e ton solar tech 
e ton solar tech was also our largest customer in fiscal at the end of fiscal and  and of our backlog consists of open sales orders and deferred revenue from e ton solar tech  respectively 
many of our customer relationships have been developed over a short period of time and certain customers are in their preliminary stages of development 
the loss of sales to any of these customers would have a significant negative impact on our business 
our agreements with these customers may be cancelled if we fail to meet certain product specifications  materially breach the agreement or in the event of bankruptcy  and our customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of current agreements or renewals 
we cannot be certain that these customers will generate significant revenue for us in the future nor that these customer relationships will continue to develop 
if our relationships with our other customers do not continue to develop  we may not be able to expand our customer base or maintain or increase our revenue 
as of september   accounts receivable from three customers each exceeded of accounts receivable  these three customers accounted for  and of total accounts receivable  respectively 
a concentration of our receivables from one or a small number of customers places us at risk 
if any one or more of our major customers does not pay us it could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we attempt to manage this credit risk by performing credit checks  by requiring significant partial payments prior to shipment where appropriate and by actively monitoring collections 
we also require letters of credit of certain customers depending on the size of the order  type of customer or its creditworthiness and its country of domicile 
if any of our customers cancels or fails to accept a large system order  our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our backlog includes orders for large systems  such as our diffusion furnaces  with system prices of up to and in excess of million depending on the system configuration  options included and any special requirements of the customer 
because our orders are typically subject to cancellation or delay by the customer  our backlog at any particular point in time is not necessarily representative of actual sales for succeeding periods  nor is backlog any assurance that we will realize revenue or profit from completing these orders 
our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected should any large systems order be cancelled prior to shipment  or not be accepted by the customer 
we have experienced significant cancellations in the past  including million in fiscal  million in  and million in we have not experienced any significant cancellations since likewise  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers that purchase large systems could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
our backlog does not provide any assurance that we will realize revenue or profit from those orders or indicate in which period net revenue will be recognized  if ever 
our business might be adversely affected by a decline in our sales to foreign customers  significant exchange rate fluctuations and foreign laws 
during fiscal  of our net revenue came from customers outside of north america 
during fiscal  of our net revenue came from customers outside of north america as follows asia includes to china and to taiwan  and europe 
because of our significant dependence on revenue from international customers  our operating results could be negatively affected by a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business 
each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period 
periodic local or international economic downturns  trade balance issues  political instability and fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  we face competition from a number of suppliers based in asia that have certain advantages over suppliers from outside of asia 
these advantages include lower operating and regulatory costs  proximity to customers and favorable tariffs 
we recorded foreign currency transaction losses of million during fiscal  and while our business has not been materially affected in the past by currency fluctuations  there is a risk that it may be materially adversely affected in the future 
such risk includes possible losses due to currency exchange rate fluctuations  possible future prohibitions against repatriation of earnings  or proceeds from disposition of investments  and from possible social and military instability in the case of india  south korea  taiwan and possibly elsewhere 
our wholly owned subsidiary  tempress systems  has conducted its operations in the netherlands since and during we established a subsidiary in germany to conduct the european sales of our bruce technologies product line 
in october we completed our acquisition of rd  a french company 
as a result  such operations are subject to the taxation policies  employment and labor laws  transportation regulations  import and export regulations and tariffs  possible foreign exchange restrictions  international monetary fluctuations  and other political  economic and legal policies of that nation  the european economic union and the other european nations in which it conducts business 
consequently  we might encounter unforeseen or unfamiliar difficulties in conducting our european operations 
changes in such laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and costs 
we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations 
if our critical suppliers fail to deliver sufficient quantities of quality product in a timely and cost effective manner  it could negatively affect our business 
we use a wide range of materials and services in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components  and we use numerous suppliers of materials 
we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
because of the variability and uniqueness of customer orders  we try to avoid maintaining an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing 
key suppliers include two steel mills capable of producing the types of steel to the tolerances needed for our wafer carriers  an injection molder that molds plastic inserts into our steel carriers  an adhesive manufacturer that supplies the critical glue used in the production of the semiconductor polishing templates and a pad supplier that produces a unique material used to attach semiconductor wafers to the polishing template 
we also rely on third parties for certain machined parts  steel frames and metal panels and other components used particularly in the assembly of semiconductor production equipment 
although we make what we believe are reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers  this is not always practical or even possible  accordingly  some key parts are being procured from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
during the semiconductor industry peak years  increases in demand for capital equipment resulted in longer lead times for many important system components 
future increases in demand could cause delays in meeting shipments to our customers 
because the selling price of some of our systems exceeds million  the delay in the shipment of even a single system could cause significant variations in our quarterly revenue 
there can be no assurance that our financial position and results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected if  in the future  we do not receive in a timely and cost effective manner a sufficient quantity and quality of parts to meet our production requirements 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund and expand our operations as planned 
we believe that current cash balances  our existing line of credit  cash flows generated from our operations and additional available financing will provide adequate working capital for at least the next twelve months 
however  cash flows may be insufficient for such purposes in the future and we may require additional financing for further implementation of our growth plans 
there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available if and when required  or  even if available  that it would not materially dilute the ownership percentage of the then existing shareholders  result in increased expenses or result in covenants or special rights that would restrict our operations 
we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate their internal control over financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning in fiscal we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements 
we have incurred increased expense and have devoted additional management resources to section compliance and we expect that some increased expense and use of management resources will continue in the future 
if  in the future  our ceo  chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section  investor perceptions of our company may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 
terrorist attacks and threats or actual war may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenue  costs and stock price 
the terrorist attacks in the united states  as well as events occurring in response or connection to them  including future terrorist attacks against united states targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the united states or its allies or military or trade disruptions impacting our domestic or foreign suppliers of parts  components and subassemblies  may impact our operations  including  among other things  by causing delays or losses in the delivery of supplies or finished goods and decreased sales of our products 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they could also result in economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we may experience higher than expected warranty claims and we face the risk of product liability claims or other litigation  which could be expensive and divert management from running our business 
the manufacture and sale of our products  which in operation involve toxic materials  involve the risk of product liability claims 
in addition  a failure of one of our products at a customer site could interrupt the business operations of our customer 
our existing insurance coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products if a successful product liability claim or series of product liability claims were brought against us 
we may also be involved in other legal proceedings or claims and experience threats of legal action from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
where appropriate  we intend to vigorously defend all claims 
however  any actual or threatened claims  even if not meritorious or material  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
the continued defense of these claims and other types of lawsuits could divert management s attention away from running our business 
in addition  required amounts to be paid in settlement of any claims  and the legal fees and other costs associated with such settlement  cannot be estimated and could  individually or in the aggregate  materially harm our financial condition 
we provide a limited warranty to our customers as described in more detail under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we may experience higher than expected warranty claims  which could materially harm our financial condition 
we are subject to environmental regulations  and our inability or failure to comply with these regulations could result in significant costs or the suspension of our ability to operate segments of our business 
we are subject to environmental regulations in connection with our business operations  including regulations related to manufacturing and our customers use of our products 
from time to time  we receive notices regarding these regulations 
it is our policy to respond promptly to these notices and to take any necessary corrective action 
our failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities  the imposition of fines and or the suspension or termination of development  manufacturing or use of certain of our products  each of which could damage our financial position and results of operations 
the company s income taxes are subject to variables beyond our control 
the company s net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by conditions affecting income taxes which are outside the company s control 
examples of the potential uncontrollable circumstances that could affect our tax rate the company sells and operates globally in the united states  europe and asia 
disagreement could occur on the jurisdiction of income and taxation among different governmental tax authorities 
potential areas of dispute may include transfer pricing  intercompany charges and intercompany balances 
tax rates may increase and  therefore  have a material adverse affect on our earnings and cash flows 
sustained operating losses resulting from the occurrence of any of the risk factors could result in the write off of deferred tax assets
