risk factors 
overview of our business we are a multi faceted oilfield services company that provides services and equipment to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies throughout the us  including texas  oklahoma  louisiana  arkansas  pennsylvania  new mexico  colorado  offshore in the gulf of mexico  and internationally  primarily in argentina  mexico and brazil 
we operate in three sectors of the oil and natural gas service industry oilfield services  drilling and completion and rental services 
we derive operating revenues from rates per job that we charge for the labor and equipment required to provide a service and rates per day for equipment and tools that we rent to our customers 
the price we charge for our services depends upon several factors  including the level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive environment in the particular geographic regions in which we operate 
contracts are awarded based on the price  quality of service and equipment  and the general reputation and experience of our personnel 
the demand for drilling services has historically been volatile and is affected by the capital expenditures of oil and natural gas exploration and development companies  which can fluctuate based upon the prices of oil and natural gas or the expectation for the prices of oil and natural gas 
the rig count is an important indicator of activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry 
the rig count in the us increased from as of december  to  as of december   according to the baker hughes rig count 
however the rig count in reached a peak of  in august and began to decline in the fourth quarter of and has continued to decline to  as of february  the rapid decline in the us rig count is due to the economic slowdown in the us and the decrease in natural gas and oil prices which has impacted the capital expenditures of our customers 
the turmoil in the financial markets and its impact on the availability of capital for our customers has also affected drilling activity in the us directional and horizontal rig counts increased from as of december  to as of december   which accounted for and of the total us rig count  respectively 
the directional and horizontal rig count also decreased to as of february  the offshore gulf of mexico rig count was rigs at february  from at february  while our revenue can be correlated to the rig count  our operating costs do not fluctuate in direct proportion to changes in revenues 
our operating expenses consist principally of our labor costs and benefits  equipment rentals  maintenance and repairs of our equipment  depreciation  insurance and fuel 
because many of our costs are fixed  our operating income as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of revenues 
company outlook we believe that our revenue and operating income for our oilfield service and rental services segment will suffer significantly in  due to the drop in us rig count and the reduction of our customers spending 
we have already taken steps in to reduce costs  including laying off employees and closing unprofitable operating locations 
even with these steps  our oilfield services segment may still generate negative operating income in due to its focus in the us market 
although we expect our rental services segment to be negatively impacted in a material fashion by the industry wide reduction in drilling and completion activity  we believe that our rental services segment will still generate positive operating income  albeit on lower revenue and at reduced margins 
we anticipate our drilling and completion segment will exceed results for both revenue and operating income as we benefit from a full year of operations on rigs acquired during and from the acquisition of bch at the end of our drilling and completion segment primarily operates in argentina and brazil  but we have two rigs coming into service in in the us market 
currently  we have no firm commitments of work for our us rigs  so the impact of revenue and operating income from these rigs may be insignificant 
bch is a relatively new company and has not yet attained the levels of profitability we have forecasted 

table of contents we expect to incur less general and administrative expenses in as we reduce our administrative staffs to reflect the decline in activity 
our net interest expense is dependent upon our level of debt and cash on hand  which are principally dependent on acquisitions we complete  our capital expenditures and our cash flows from operations 
due to the shortage of liquidity and credit in the us financial markets  we may see an increase in our effective interest rate in in addition  the interest rate on our credit facilities may increase if we violate any of our financial covenants in we anticipate that our effective tax rate will increase in due to a lower taxable income to spread the negative effects of non deductible items and state income taxes 
this rate could exceed for us tax purposes in in addition  the favorable tax rates we realized in from our international operations due to foreign currency fluctuations  may not be realized in the sustainability and future growth in our operating income is principally dependent on our level of revenues and the pricing environment of our services 
in addition  our sustainability and the demand for our services is dependent upon our customers capital spending plans  which are largely driven by current commodity prices and their expectations of future commodity prices 
recent declines in both natural gas and oil prices have caused our customers to delay or curtail capital spending plans 
in addition to the impact of the decline in natural gas prices on our customers capital expenditures and overall liquidity  the recent credit crisis has limited the availability of funds  which lead to decreased capital expenditures for our customers 
the shortage of liquidity and credit combined with recent substantial losses in worldwide equity markets could lead to an extended global recession 
the slowdown in economic activity caused by the recession has reduced demand for energy and resulted in lower oil and natural gas prices 
such a continued slowdown in economic activity could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
we are monitoring the credit worthiness of our customers  as well as outstanding receivables  in light of the current credit crisis and as such increased our reserve for doubtful accounts significantly at december   but further reserves may be necessary in we continue to monitor the effect of the global financial crisis on our industry  and the resulting impact on the capital spending budgets of our customers in order to estimate the effect on our company 
we have already reduced our planned capital spending significantly in compared to we currently expect that capital expenditures will total approximately million compared to capital expenditures of million 
we believe that will be an extremely challenging year for our operations but we are optimistic that our cost saving cuts  coupled with our strategy of striving to mitigate cyclical risk through our international growth  by offering new equipment and technology to our customers and our focus on the us land shale plays  will carry us through the current recession 
results of operations in april  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of rogers and in october  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of petro rentals  and the results for the operations of both acquired companies are included in our oilfield services segment 
in august  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of dls and in december  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of tanus 
we report the operations of dls and tanus in our drilling and completion segment 
in january  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of specialty and in december  we acquired substantially all of the assets of ogr 
we report the operations of specialty and ogr in our rental services segment 
in june  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of coker  in july  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of diggar and in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets of diamondback 
in october  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of rebel 
in june  we sold our capillary assets 
we report the operations of these four acquisitions and one disposition in our oilfield services segment 
in december  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of bch  which will be reported as part of our drilling and completion segment 
in august  we sold our drill pipe tong manufacturing assets  which were reported in our oilfield services segment 
we consolidated the results of all of these acquisitions from the day they were acquired 

table of contents the foregoing acquisitions and dispositions affect the comparability from period to period of our historical results  and our historical results may not be indicative of our future results 
comparison of years ended december  and december  our revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues is due to the increase in revenues in our drilling and completion and our oilfield services segments  offset in part by a decrease in revenues in our rental services segment 
the most significant increase in revenues was in our drilling and completion segment due to additional drilling and service rigs placed in service in and price increases 
the drilling and completion segment generated million in revenues for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our oilfield services segment revenues increased to million in compared to million in due to acquisitions completed in the third and fourth quarters of which added downhole motors  measurement while drilling  or mwd  tools  and directional drilling personnel resulting in increased capacity and increased market penetration 
revenues also increased at our oilfield services segment due to the purchase of additional equipment  principally new compressor packages for our underbalanced operations  coiled tubing equipment and expansion of operations into new geographic regions 
the impact of the additional mwd tools  downhole motors and the acquisitions of diggar and coker completed in the last half of are not easily identifiable as they were quickly integrated with our pre existing operations 
the acquisition of the diamondback assets provided million in revenues for the year ended december  compared to million in revenues from the date of acquisition to december  the additional coiled tubing equipment provided an additional million in revenues for the year ended december  compared to these increases in revenue were partially offset by a significant decrease in revenues at our rental services segment due to the reduction of drilling activity in the us gulf of mexico beginning in the last half of  as rigs departed the us gulf in favor of the international markets and the impact of hurricanes in these factors also caused the pricing for our rental services segment to become more competitive 
also impacting revenues was a million decrease in revenues from our capillary tubing assets compared to as those assets were sold on june  our direct costs for the year ended december  increased to million  or of revenues  compared to million  or  of revenues for the year ended december  on a percentage basis  direct costs in our oilfield services segment outpaced the growth in revenue for that segment 
oilfield services revenue for the year ended december  increased from revenue in the oilfield services segment for the year ended december   while the direct costs increased over that same period 
this unfavorable variance was primarily associated with costs incurred in the deployment of our new coiled tubing rigs 
on a percentage basis  direct costs in our drilling and completion segment outpaced the growth in our revenue for that segment 
drilling and completion revenue for the year ended december  increased from revenue in the drilling and completion segment for the year ended december   while the direct costs increased over that same period 
this unfavorable variance is primarily attributed to higher labor costs in our drilling and completion segment relating to labor concessions in argentina granted by the oil industry in the last half of and a significant increase in our labor force and labor related expenses in connection with the delivery of new rigs prior to their activation 
our direct costs in our rental services segment did not decrease on the same percentage as the drop in our revenue for that segment 
rental services revenue for the year ended december  decreased from revenue in the rental services segment for the year ended december   while the direct costs decreased over that same period 
our direct costs for the rental services segment are largely fixed because they primarily relate to yard expenses to maintain the rental inventory 
in addition  the change in the service mix from the longer term gulf of mexico rentals that we benefited from in to the shorter term land drilling rental work in  requires more handling on our part which increases costs 
depreciation expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the primary increase in depreciation expense is due to 
table of contents the acquisitions completed in the second half of and our capital expenditures  principally the addition of new service rigs and one drilling rig in argentina 
general and administrative expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expense increased primarily due to the amortization of share based compensation arrangements 
general and administrative expense includes share based compensation expense of million in and million in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses were in compared to in effective august   we sold our drill pipe tong manufacturing assets that were part of our oilfield services segment 
the total consideration was approximately million 
we recognized a gain of  related to the transaction 
on june   we sold our capillary tubing assets that were part of our oilfield services segment 
the total consideration was approximately million in cash 
we recognized a gain of million related to the sale of these assets 
in accordance with fasb no 
 we recorded an impairment of goodwill of million as of december  in light of adverse market conditions affecting our stock price and market conditions  we determined that impairment was necessary on all of our goodwill associated with our rental services segment as well as on our tubular services and production services reporting units included in our oilfield services segment 
we performed the same annual impairment test as of december  and recorded no impairment 
amortization expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our loss from operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million in income from operations for the year ended december   for a total decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily related to the million goodwill impairment  increased depreciation and amortization expense of million from the year ended december  compared to year ended december  and the million gain related to the sale of our capillary tubing assets in our interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  during  we borrowed against our revolving credit facility and as of december   we had an outstanding balance of million 
in  through our dls subsidiary in argentina  we also entered into a new million import finance facility with a bank to fund a portion of the purchase price of new drilling and service rigs 
in january we issued million of senior notes bearing interest at to pay off  in part  the million bridge loan utilized to complete the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of ogr and for working capital 
this bridge loan was repaid on january  the average interest rate on the bridge loan was approximately

interest expense also includes amortization expense of deferred financing costs of million and million for and  respectively 
our interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  in january  we invested million into a convertible subordinated secured debenture with bch 
we earned interest on this note up until december   when we acquired all of the outstanding stock of bch 
in  we had excess cash as the result of a senior note financing and an equity offering and we were able to generate interest income during this period 
our benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  or of our net loss before income taxes  compared to a income tax expense of million  or of our net income before income taxes for the income tax benefit recorded in was the result of net loss before income taxes compared to net income before income taxes in the previous year and a lower effective tax rate 
the lower effective tax rate in is attributable to the impact of foreign currency losses on the 
table of contents foreign income tax as well a lower benefit from the loss generated on our us operations due to nondeductible expenses and state income taxes 
we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the following table compares revenues and income loss from operations for each of our business segments for the years ended december  and december  income loss from operations consists of our revenues and the gain on asset dispositions less direct costs  general and administrative expenses  goodwill impairment  depreciation and amortization revenues income loss from operations change change in thousands oilfield services drilling completion rental services general corporate total oilfield services

depreciation expense increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year due to capital expenditures for the drilling and completion segment in and rental services 
our rental services revenues were million for the year ended december   a decrease of from the million in revenues for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to a more competitive market environment due to the decreased us gulf of mexico drilling activity beginning in the last half of stemming from the departure of drilling rigs in favor of the international markets and the impact of hurricanes in the us gulf of mexico in

the drilling and completion segment generated million in revenues for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the period from the date of the dls acquisition to december  revenues also increased significantly at our rental services segment due to the acquisition of the ogr assets on december  the ogr assets  including its two rental yards  expanded our assets available for rent 
the ogr assets generated revenues of million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the period from the date of acquisition of the ogr assets to december  we experienced a decline in demand at our rental services segment in the last half of due to a reduction of drilling activity in the us gulf of mexico as rigs departed the us gulf in favor of the international markets

our depreciation expense for the ogr assets increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to  for the period from the date of acquisition of the ogr assets to december  rental services revenues and operating income was impacted by a more competitive market environment due to the decreased us gulf of mexico drilling activity in the last half of attributed to the hurricane season and the departure of drilling rigs in favor of the international markets 
liquidity and capital resources our on going capital requirements arise primarily from our need to service our debt  to acquire and maintain equipment  to fund our working capital requirements and to complete acquisitions 
our primary sources of liquidity are proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities and cash flows from operations 
our amended and restated revolving credit facility permits borrowings of up to million in principal amount 
as of december   we had million available for borrowing under our amended and restated revolving credit facility 
we also have up to million available under a new credit agreement which we executed in february to fund a portion of the purchase price of two drilling rigs 
cash flows from operations are expected to be our primary source of liquidity in fiscal we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  our revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
if we fail to comply with the financial ratio covenants  it could limit or eliminate the availability under our revolving credit agreement 
our ability to maintain such financial ratios may be affected by events beyond our control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  and we cannot assure you that we will maintain or meet such ratios and tests or that the lenders under the credit agreement will waive any failure to meet such ratios or tests 
the decrease in the us rig count experienced late in and early  the expectation of additional decreases in the us rig count  and the resulting decrease in demand for our services adversely impacts our ability to maintain or meet such financial ratios 

table of contents we have reduced our planned capital spending for compared to exclusive of any opportunistic acquisitions  we currently expect to spend a total of approximately million in  which is net of equipment deposits paid in as of december   we had commitments covering million of the million 
we believe that our cash generated from operations  cash on hand and cash available under our credit facilities will provide sufficient funds for our identified projects 
our ability to obtain capital for opportunistic acquisitions or additional projects to implement our growth strategy over the longer term will depend upon our future operating performance and financial condition  which will be dependent upon the prevailing conditions in our industry and the global market  including the availability of equity and debt financing  many of which are beyond our control

additional workforce reductions and other cost saving measures are anticipated 
capital expenditures for will be limited to required maintenance levels and those related to firm commitments made in critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
our preparation of this report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
the determination of the collectibility of amounts due from our customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends  including monitoring our customer payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectibility is reasonably assured  as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our customers operate 
those uncertainties require us to make frequent judgments and estimates regarding our customers ability to pay amounts due us in order to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident that the customers will not be able to make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future 
revenue recognition 
we provide rental equipment and drilling services to our customers at per day  or daywork  and per job contractual rates and recognize the drilling related revenue as the work progresses and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from daywork contracts is recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
on daywork contracts  revenue is recognized based on the number of days completed at fixed rates stipulated by the contract 
for certain contracts  we receive lump sum and other fees for equipment and other mobilization costs 
mobilization fees and the related costs are deferred and amortized over the contract terms when material 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  principally property  plant and equipment  comprise a significant amount of our total assets 
we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires us to make long term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
goodwill and other intangibles 
as of december   we have recorded approximately million of goodwill and million of other identifiable intangible assets 
we perform purchase price allocations to intangible assets when we make a business combination 
business combinations and purchase price allocations have been consummated for acquisitions in all of our reportable segments 
the excess of the purchase price after allocation of fair values to tangible assets is allocated to identifiable intangibles and thereafter to goodwill 
we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized and whether the asset has finite live for amortization purposes 
we perform our annual impairment test in accordance with fasb no 
our tests included two approaches to determine the carrying amount of the individual reporting units 
the first approach is the discounted cash flow method  which focuses on our expected cash flow 
in applying this approach  the cash flow available for distribution is projected for a finite period of years 
cash flow available for distribution is defined as the amount of cash that could be distributed as a dividend without impairing our future profitability or operations 
the cash flow available for distribution and the terminal value our value at the end of the estimation period are then discounted to present value to derive an indication of value of the business enterprise 
this valuation method is dependent upon the assumptions made regarding future cash flow and cash requirements 
the second approach is the guideline company method which focuses on comparing us to selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies 
under this method  valuation multiples are i derived from operating data of selected similar companies  ii evaluated and adjusted based on our strengths and weaknesses relative to the selected guideline companies  and iii applied to our operating data to arrive at an indication of value 
this valuation method is dependent upon the assumption that our value can be evaluated by analysis of our earnings and our strengths and weaknesses relative to the selected similar companies 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in as a result of our test 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require an additional provision for impairment in a future period 
purchase price allocation of acquired businesses 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the businesses  post acquisition  based on estimated fair values 
the 
table of contents excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
we engage third party appraisal firms and valuation experts to assist in the determination of identifiable assets and liabilities 
our judgments and estimates for the allocation of purchase price are based on information available during the measurement period  these judgments and estimates can materially impact our financial position as well as our results of operations 
income taxes 
the determination and evaluation of our annual income tax provision involves the interpretation of tax laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations and our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction may impact our tax liability in any given year 
while our annual tax provision is based on the information available to us at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in certain tax jurisdictions are determined 
current income tax expense benefit reflects an estimate of our income tax liability for the current year  withholding taxes  changes in tax rates and changes in prior year tax estimates as returns are filed 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect at year end 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we provide for uncertain tax positions pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
it is our intention to permanently reinvest all of the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries in such subsidiaries 
accordingly  we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries 
if a distribution is made to us from the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional taxes 
because we cannot predict when  if at all  we will make a distribution of these undistributed earnings  we are unable to make a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
sfas no

under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no

 an entity may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at the adoption date 
subsequent to the initial adoption  the election of the fair value option should only be made at the initial recognition of the asset or liability or upon a re measurement event that gives rise to the new basis of accounting 
all subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument are reported in earnings 
sfas no 
does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be recorded at fair value nor does it eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we adopted sfas no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange risks 
interest rate risk fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current and future fixed and variable rate debt obligations expose us to market risk 
we are vulnerable to significant fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt and on any future refinancing of our fixed rate debt and on future debt 
at december   we were exposed to interest rate fluctuations on approximately million of bank loans carrying variable interest rates 
a hypothetical one hundred basis point increase in interest rates for these notes payable would increase our annual interest expense by approximately  due to the uncertainty of fluctuations in interest rates and the specific actions that might be taken by us to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations and their possible effects  the foregoing sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure 
we have also been subject to interest rate market risk for short term invested cash and cash equivalents 
the principal of such invested funds would not be subject to fluctuating value because of their highly liquid short term nature 
as of december   we had no short term maturing investments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have designated the us dollar as the functional currency for our operations in international locations as we contract with customers  purchase equipment and finance capital using the us dollar 
local currency transaction gains and losses  arising from remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in local currency  are included in our consolidated statements of income 
for the years ended december   and  we had a net foreign exchange loss of million   and  respectively relating to our drilling and completion operations 
we also conduct international business through our rental services and oilfield services segments and to control the foreign exchange risk  we provide for payment in us dollars
