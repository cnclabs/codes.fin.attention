business overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical and medical device company that discovers  develops and markets innovative technologies primarily focused on acute and surgical applications 
we generate our revenue through our sales of medical products and components  as well as from royalties derived from sales by our partners of products utilizing certain of our proprietary technologies 
for the year ended december   we recorded million in direct sales of our various medical products and million in royalties and license fees received from our partners 
our research and development efforts focus on understanding and characterizing biological conditions that often occur concurrent with medical device implantation  surgery or acute trauma  including scar formation and inflammation  cell proliferation  bleeding and coagulation  infection  and tumor tissue overgrowth 
our strategy is to utilize our various technologies in the areas of drugs  drug delivery  surface modification  biomaterials and medical devices to create and commercialize novel  proprietary medical products that reduce surgical procedure side effects  improve surgical outcomes  shorten hospital stays  or are easier or safer for a physician to use 
we develop our products using a proprietary and systematic discovery approach 
we use our drug screening capabilities to identify new uses for known pharmaceutical compounds 
we look for compounds that address the underlying biological causes of conditions that can occur with medical device implantation  surgery or acute trauma 
once appropriate drugs have been identified  we work to formulate the drug  or a combination of drugs  with our portfolio of drug  drug delivery and surface modification technologies and biomaterials to develop a novel surgical implant or medical device 
we have patent protected  or have filed patent applications for  certain of our technology and many of our products and potential product candidates 
we currently operate in two segments pharmaceutical technologies and medical products 
pharmaceutical technologies our pharmaceutical technologies segment focuses primarily on establishing product development and marketing partnerships with major medical device  pharmaceutical or biomaterials companies and to date has derived the majority of its revenue from royalties due from partners that develop  market and sell products incorporating our technologies 
currently  our principal revenues in this segment are from royalties derived from sales by boston scientific corporation bsc of taxus coronary stent systems incorporating the drug paclitaxel 
medical products our medical products segment manufactures and markets a wide range of single use specialty medical products  primarily medical device products and medical device components 
these products are sold directly to end users or other third party medical device manufacturers 
this segment contains two specialized direct sales and distribution organizations as well as significant manufacturing capabilities 
many of our medical products are made using our proprietary manufacturing processes  or are protected by our intellectual property 
our medical products segment may apply certain of our proprietary technologies to its products to create novel  next generation medical products to market directly to end users or medical products distributors 
financial and strategic alternatives process 
during approximately the last eight calendar quarters  revenue in our pharmaceutical technologies segment has declined significantly  primarily due to lower than expected royalties derived from sales by bsc of taxus coronary stent systems 
this decline in royalty revenue has significantly impacted our ability to fund our operations and service our debt obligations  and has materially impacted our liquidity position 
during  our management and board of directors determined to explore and pursue various restructuring and cost reduction actions in order to conserve our liquidity  as well as various financial and strategic transactions that could potentially reduce or eliminate our existing debt obligations and improve our working capital position 
our management and board of directors continue to believe a transaction of significant size and scope is necessary to meaningfully address the working capital needs of our business initiatives  as well as to address liquidity issues related to our current balance sheet structure  likely to arise in the near term due to several factors that have impacted our business and cash flows from operations 
in particular  we continue to expect to receive lower revenues from bsc over the next several quarters  mainly due to the impact of new competitive entrants into the market for drug eluting stents and other factors 
on july   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a transaction to create a new subsidiary  angiotech pharmaceutical interventions inc api  and that we would contribute certain business assets and intellectual property to api  primarily consisting of business assets of angiotech other than the intellectual property and royalty revenue related to taxus 
in connection with this transaction  we were to receive to million of new financing from new investors to establish api  which financing was targeted to reduce substantial amounts of our existing debt obligations with equivalent amounts of convertible debt bearing interest in additional equity of the newly created subsidiary in kind  as opposed to cash 
this transaction  if approved by our shareholders and completed  would have substantially reduced our annual cash pay interest obligations 
on september   we announced that we had postponed the planned shareholder vote regarding the proposed api transaction 
as of that date  given the time required for more extended discussions to address concerns of certain of our shareholders and bondholders  and given various other factors impacting our business and cash position including lower expected revenues derived from bsc  we did not believe we would be able to satisfy the transaction condition with respect to the minimum level of cash and cash equivalents required to be held at the time of the transaction s close 
as a result of the uncertainty regarding our proposed transaction  we also announced on september  that management and the board of directors would continue to explore alternatives to our balance sheet and current capital structure  including but not limited to whether we could consummate the previously announced transaction or other similar transaction alternatives 
on november   the api transaction was terminated 
on november   we announced that we had engaged the blackstone group to assist us in evaluating various alternatives for our business and capital structure  including  but not limited to  securing interim senior secured financing for working capital and liquidity purposes  evaluating various restructuring alternatives to pursue with the holders of our senior floating rate notes due the floating rate notes and our senior subordinated notes due the subordinated notes  and assisting us in evaluating proposals or potential proposals from various financial parties regarding a significant investment of capital 
on march   we announced that we had completed a financing transaction with wells fargo foothill  llc  consisting of a delayed draw secured term loan facility of up to million and a new secured revolving credit facility providing up to an additional million in available credit 
see liquidity and capital resources new senior secured credit facilities 
cost reduction initiatives 
on september   we announced that  in connection with the update to our financial and strategic alternatives process as described above  we would pursue various initiatives to further reduce operating costs and focus our business efforts  including postponement of the scheduled launch of our flourouracil eluting central venous catheter fu cvc  closure of our research and manufacturing facility in rochester  ny  and rationalization or elimination of office and laboratory space in vancouver  bc  north bend  wa and herndon  va  postponement of certain pre clinical stage research activities  pending the completion of partnering or other funding activities that would offset direct costs and personnel costs associated with such programs  reduction of certain financial and personnel contributions relating to our joint venture with genzyme corporation  potential amendment of and reduction in cash outlays related to our collaboration with athersys  inc  rationalization of selected pending and issued intellectual property  elimination of certain expenses and reductions in personnel in all general and administrative departments  selective reduction in certain sales and marketing investments and in medical affairs  and postponement of selected planned capital expenditures 
our remaining resources subsequent to these changes have been focused primarily on our existing medical device products business  with particular emphasis on our portfolio of promoted brands  and on selected new products that have recently launched including quill srs  and the hemostream chronic dialysis catheter

ongoing clinical programs the following discussion describes our product candidates  or certain of our partners product candidates  that are being evaluated in ongoing human clinical trials and their stage of development taxus element platinum chromium paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system 
the taxus element paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system is the third generation bsc coronary stent platform that incorporates our research  technology and intellectual property related to the use of paclitaxel 
the taxus element stent features bsc s proprietary platinum chromium alloy  which is designed to enable thinner stent struts  increased flexibility and a lower stent profile while improving radial strength  recoil and radiopacity 
in addition  the taxus element stent platform incorporates new balloon technology intended to improve upon bsc s market leading maverick balloon catheter technology 
taxus petal bifurcation paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system 
the taxus petal bifurcation paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system  which is under evaluation in clinical trials being conducted by bsc  represents a novel bsc coronary stent product candidate that incorporates our research  technology and intellectual property related to the use of paclitaxel 
conventional coronary stents were designed to treat tubular arteries  and are considered less than optimal for the y shaped anatomy of a bifurcated area of the coronary arteries 
the taxus petal is a specialized coronary stent designed to treat both the main branch and the side branch of a bifurcation by incorporating an innovative side structure the petal strut in the middle of the stent that opens into a side branch 
on july   bsc initiated the taxus petal i first human use fhu trial  which is expected to enroll a total of patients in new zealand  france and germany 
the trial is a non randomized study with an initial assessment of acute performance and safety including rates of death  myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization at days and six months  with continued annual follow up to occur for five years 
upon successful completion of this study  bsc has indicated that it intends to begin a pivotal trial which if successful would provide a basis for us and international approvals for the commercialization of the taxus petal stent 
zilver ptx paclitaxel eluting peripheral vascular stent system 
the zilver ptx paclitaxel eluting peripheral vascular stent  which is under evaluation in clinical trials being conducted by our partner cook  is a specialized stent product incorporating our proprietary paclitaxel technology and is designed for placement in diseased arteries in the limbs to restore blood flow 
cook is a co exclusive licensee  together with bsc  of our proprietary paclitaxel technology to reduce restenosis following stent placement in peripheral artery disease 
the zilver ptx paclitaxel eluting peripheral stent is designed to reduce restenosis following placement of a stent in pad patients 
the zilver ptx is currently undergoing multiple human clinical trials in the united states  japan  the european union and selected other countries to assess product safety and efficacy 
in january  cook released nine month data from its eu clinical study 
the preliminary data presented by cook on the first patients in the randomized trial  which is examining the safety of using cook s zilver ptx paclitaxel eluting stent to treat blockages  or lesions  of the superficial femoral artery sfa above the knee  indicated that the zilver ptx stent showed an equal adverse event rate to conventional angioplasty for treating sfa lesions 
the zilver ptx stent also displayed a zero percent fracture rate for lesions at six months and lesions at one year 
on june   cook reported positive interim results from the registry arm of a clinical study designed to measure the efficacy of the zilver ptx in treating pad patients  specifically in the treatment of blockages in the femoropopliteal artery 
the results were reported by trial investigators at the svs vascular annual meeting  and revealed clinical improvement  excellent durability and fracture resistance  high rates of event free survival efs and freedom from target lesion revascularization tlr 
interim data was compiled at six and months using patients and patients  respectively 
the corresponding efs rates were percent and percent  and freedom from tlr was percent and percent 
evaluation of stent x rays is ongoing  and currently suggests stent fractures in approximately one percent of cases at six months and less than two percent of cases at months 
in addition  the zilver ptx stent exhibit ed no safety concerns and results were better than expected for trans atlantic inter society consensus tasc class c and d lesions  occlusions  in stent restenosis and lesions greater than seven centimeters 
follow up to the registry arm of the study will continue through two years 
on july  cook announced that the first us patients in a randomized pivotal human clinical trial of zilver ptx were treated at tri city medical center in oceanside  ca 
the trial is designed to randomize patients to receive either the zilver ptx stent or balloon angioplasty 
data from this clinical trial is intended to be used to support submission to the fda for approval in the united states to market the device 
in addition  data collected on japanese and us patients is expected to be combined for the final evaluation of the device and used for regulatory submissions in both markets for approval 
on september  cook announced it had completed enrollment in its pivotal human clinical trial for the zilver ptx 
the patients enrolled in cook s randomized trial include peripheral artery disease patients treated in germany  the united states and japan 
on the same date  cook announced that it had enrolled an additional patients in the european union  canada and korea in a clinical registry to evaluate the safety of the zilver ptx device 
those data have been used for submission in europe for ce mark approval to market the device there  with additional regulatory submissions pending in additional markets 
bio seal lung biopsy tract plug system 
bio seal is a novel technology designed to prevent air leaks in patients having lung biopsies by plugging the biopsy track with an expanding hydrogel plug 
on contact with moist tissue  the hydrogel plug absorbs fluids and expands to fill the void created by the biopsy needle puncture 
the seal is airtight and the plug is absorbed into the body after healing of the puncture site has occurred 
bio seal has undergone a human clinical trial in the us which was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of bio seal  with the primary endpoint being reduction in rates of pneumothorax in patients undergoing lung biopsy procedures 
the clinical trial was a prospective randomized multi centered safety and efficacy evaluation 
the trial enrolled its first patient in october and completed enrolment in june the study was designed to provide a basis for us clearance for the commercialization of bio seal 
data from this clinical trial study has been submitted to the fda 
the fda has responded to our submission with additional questions about the study 
we have responded to the fda  and upon further review by the fda we may either receive k clearance to market bio seal in the united states or be required to respond to additional questions or conduct additional clinical studies for this product candidate 
upon receiving such further informat ion from the fda  we will determine the timing of product launch or any further development work necessary to achieve approval should we choose to continue the development of this product candidate 
the complete data for the bio seal study was presented at the society of interventional radiology in san diego  ca on march  the trial hit its primary end point with clinical success in of the treatment patients compared to for the control patients p 
the product has already received ce mark approval 
option vena cava filter 
the option vena cava filter  which we licensed in march from our partner rex medical lp  is under evaluation in a pivotal human clinical trial 
we believe this vena cava filter may have a number of potential benefits  which include unique filter apex and retention anchors  insertion through either the femoral or jugular route  and non thrombogenic material 
the purpose of the us multi center prospective clinical trial is to evaluate the device s safety and efficacy in preventing pulmonary emboli  and to assess the ability to retrieve the device from the body up to days following implantation 
interim results of the pivotal trial were presented at the aim veith meeting in new york in november the complete results  representing a total of patients  were presented at the society of interventional radiology in san diego  ca on march  the clinical data from this trial has been submi tted to the fda 
the fda has responded to our submission with additional questions about the study and we are preparing a response 
multistem stem cell therapy 
the multistem stem cell therapy is under evaluation in clinical trials being conducted together with our partner athersys  inc athersys for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction 
multistem stem cells are proprietary adult stem cells derived from bone marrow  which have demonstrated the ability in laboratory experiments to form a wide range of cell types 
multistem may work through several mechanisms  but a primary mechanism appears to be the production of multiple therapeutic molecules produced in response to inflammation and tissue damage 
we and athersys believe that multistem may represent a unique off the shelf stem cell product candidate  based on its potential ability to be used without tissue matching or immunosupression  and its potential capacity for large scale production 
we entered into an agreement with athersys in may to co develop and commercialize multistem for use in the indications o f acute myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease 
on december   we and athersys announced we had received authorization from the fda to commence a phase i human clinical trial to evaluate the safety of multistem in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction 
upon completion of a phase i human clinical trial currently being conducted by athersys  we may assume lead responsibility for further clinical development 
we currently own marketing and commercialization rights with respect to this product candidate 
on september   as part of certain cost reduction initiatives  we announced a potential amendment of  and reduction in  cash outlays related to our collaboration with athersys 
the final terms of such amendment to our collaboration with athersys may have an impact on our expected future expenditures for research and development of multistem  and the extent of our future financial and commercial commitments and rights relating to this product candidate 
completed or suspended clinical programs fu eluting central venous catheter 
central venous catheters cvc are usually inserted into critically ill patients for extended periods of time to administer fluids  drugs  and nutrition  as well as facilitate frequent blood draws 
through our proprietary drug identification strategy  we have elected to evaluate fluorouracil fu  a drug previously approved by the fda for treatment of various types of cancer  as a compound that may help to prevent certain types of infection in patients receiving a cvc 
we recently completed a human clinical trial in the united states designed to assess the safety and efficacy of our fu eluting cvc in preventing various types of catheter related infections 
the study was a randomized  single blind  patient  center study and was designed to evaluate whether our fu eluting cvc prevents bacterial colonization at least as well as the market leading anti infective cvc 
on july   we announce d that we had completed enrollment of the study  and on october   we announced this study had met its primary statistical endpoint of non inferiority as compared to the market leading anti infective cvc a chlorhexidine silver sulfadiazine ch ss coated cvc and indicated an excellent safety profile 
in march  we presented the clinical trial data at the th international symposium on intensive care and emergency medicine isicem in brussels  belgium based on the clinical trial data  the investigators concluded that our fu cvc met the primary endpoint of the study  specifically that our fu cvc product candidate was non inferior in its ability to prevent bacterial colonization of the catheter tip when compared to catheters coated with ch ss 
there were no statistically significant differences in the rate of adverse events related to the study devices  or in the rates of catheter related bloodstream infections 
additionally  there was no evidence for acquired resistance to fu in clinical isolates exposed to the drug for a second time 
based on the positive results achieved in the study  in december we filed a request for k clearance from the fda to market and sell the cvc in the united states and on april   we announced that we had received k clearance from the fda to market our fu cvc in the united states but have not yet commercially launched the product 
taxus libert paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system 
the taxus libert paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system is bsc s second generation coronary stent system platform that incorporates our research  technology and intellectual property related to the use of paclitaxel to prevent restenosis 
the taxus libert stent system has been designed to further enhance coronary stent deliverability and blood vessel conformability  particularly in challenging coronary lesions 
to date  bsc has only commenced sales of the taxus libert in countries outside of the united states 
on october   we announced that bsc had received approval from the fda to market and sell the taxus libert in the united states 
vascular wrap our paclitaxel eluting mesh surgical implant  or vascular wrap  is designed to treat complications  including graft stenosis or restenosis  that may occur in connection with vascular graft implants in hemodialysis patients or in patients that have peripheral artery disease 
vascular grafts are implanted in patients in order to bypass diseased blood vessels  or to provide access to the vascular system of kidney failure patients in order to facilitate the process of hemodialysis 
in many cases  these vascular grafts fail due to proliferation of cells or scar into the graft graft stenosis or restenosis  which can negatively impact blood flow through the vascular graft 
in april  we elected to suspend enrollment in our us and eu human clinical trials for our vascular wrap product candidate in patients undergoing surgery for hemodialysis access  pending a safety review to evaluate an imbalance of infections observed between the two study groups 
as a result of these observations  we elected to notify physicians to suspend further enrollment in the trials  pending a full review of the potential cause of the implant site infections 
there are currently no plans to resume enrollment in these clinical trials  and we are continuing to evaluate alternatives for this program  including potential collaborations  partnerships  divestitures or future clinical development initiatives 
acquisitions quill medical  inc quill 
on june   we completed the acquisition of of the equity of quill for million cash consideration 
through this transaction  we acquired the rights  in all possible fields of use  to develop and market applications of quill s proprietary self anchoring wound closure technology 
unlike conventional sutures which are smooth  the quill products have tiny teeth like barbs or cogs along the surface 
this self anchoring wound closure technology may be used to close certain wounds or surgical incisions without the need for suture knots 
eliminating knot tying can save surgical time  may reduce the risk of infection  and may reduce wound leakage 
we are currently working to develop a portfolio of next generation products using the quill technology 
in january  we launched the first of these new products  the quill srs for various wound closure and tissue approximation applications in general and aesthetic surgery 
in and throughout we launched several new quill srs product lines 
the launch of the quill srs for various indications in january triggered a development milestone of million that was paid to the former shareholders of quill in august this milestone payment is creditable against any future contingent payments that we may be required to make based upon the achievement of significant incremental revenue growth of products incorporating the quill technology over an approximately five year period from the date of the acquisition 
this million payment was recorded as an increase to goodwill during the first quarter of american medical instruments holdings  inc ami 
on march   we completed the acquisition of of the equity of ami for million cash consideration 
ami provided us with the majority of the assets and products comprising our medical products business segment 
collaboration  license and sales and distribution agreements in connection with our research and development efforts  we have entered into various arrangements with corporate and academic collaborators  licensors  licensees and others for the research  development  clinical testing  regulatory approval  manufacturing  marketing and commercialization of our product candidates 
terms of the various license agreements may require us  or our collaborators  to make milestone payments upon achievement of certain product development and commercialization objectives and pay royalties on future sales of commercial products  if any  resulting from the collaborations 
during  we did not enter into any significant collaboration  license or sales and distribution agreements 
on september   we announced a reduction of certain financial and personnel contributions relating to our collaboration with genzyme corporation  and a potential amendment of  and reduction in  cash outlays related to our collaboration with athersys  inc our most significant collaborations  licences  sales and distribution agreements are listed in the exhibits index to this annual report on form k and may be found at the locations specified therein 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
these accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable and are based upon information available to us at the time the estimates and assumptions were made 
actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the following policies to be critical to understanding our financial condition  results of operations  and expectations for because these policies require management to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition i royalty revenue we recognize royalty revenue when we have fulfilled the terms in accordance with the contractual agreement  have no future obligations  the amount of the royalty fee is determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we record royalty revenue from bsc on a cash basis due to our inability to accurately estimate the bsc royalty before we receive the reports and payments from bsc 
this results in a one quarter lag between the time we record royalty revenue and the time the associated sales were recorded by bsc 
ii product sales we recognize revenue from product sales  including shipments to distributors  when the product is shipped from our facilities to the customer provided that we have not retained any significant risks of ownership or future obligations with respect to products shipped 
we recognize revenue from product sales net of provisions for future returns 
these provisions are established in the same period as the related product sales are recorded and are based on estimates derived from our historical experience 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor 
we include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling in revenue 
the corresponding costs for shipping and handling are included in cost of products sold 
iii license fees license fees are comprised of initial fees and milestone payments derived from collaborative and other licensing arrangements 
we recognize non refundable milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones when the milestone payment is substantive in nature  the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and we have no further significant involvement or obligation to perform under the arrangement 
initial fees and non refundable milestone payments received which require our ongoing involvement are deferred and amortized into income on a straight line basis over the period of our ongoing involvement 
income tax expense income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the value of these assets 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for any valuation allowance adjustment 
a valuation allowance is provided for the portion of deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be unrealized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes including  but not limited to  accruals for tax contingencies and valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations 
our effective tax rate may change from period to period based on the mix of income among the different foreign jurisdictions in which we operate  changes in tax laws in these jurisdictions  and changes in the amount of valuation allowance recorded 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin is designed to reduce diversity and provide consistent accounting practices and criteria for how companies should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in their financial statements all significant uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas r share based payment  a revision to sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires us to recognize the grant date fair value of share based compensation awards granted to employees over the requisite service period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate stock option values  which requires certain assumptions including the future stock price volatility and expected time to exercise 
changes to any of these assumptions  or the use of a different option pricing model such as the binomial model  could produce a different fair value for stock based compensation  which could have a material impact on our earnings 
cash equivalents  short and long term investments we invest our excess cash balances in short term securities  principally investment grade commercial debt and government agency notes 
at december   we held one equity security which was classified as available for sale  and accordingly  was recorded at fair market value 
the security has been trading below carrying value for an extended period of time and management does not intend to hold it for a sufficient period of time to reasonably expect a recovery to initial carrying value 
as such  the unrealized loss on this security has been reported in other income and expenses 
as part of our strategic product development efforts  we also invest in equity securities of certain companies with which we have collaborative agreements 
the equity securities of some of these companies are not publicly traded and so fair value is not readily available 
these investments are recorded using the cost method of accounting and are tested for impairment by reference to anticipated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the investment  the results of operations and financial position of the investee  and other evidence supporting the net realizable value of the investment 
goodwill we test goodwill for possible impairment at least annually and whenever changes in circumstances occur that would indicate an impairment in the value of goodwill 
when the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment include adverse changes or outcomes in legal or regulatory matters  technological advances  decreases in anticipated demand  unanticipated competition  and significant declines in our share price 
we estimate fair value based on a discounted projection of future cash flows which are subject to significant uncertainty and estimates 
if future cash flows are less than those projected  an impairment charge may become necessary that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we tested our goodwill for impairment as at september  and determined that due to a significant and sustained decline in our public stock market capitalization our goodwill was impaired and as a consequence we recorded an impairment charge of million during the three months ended september  given the continued decline in our market value in the fourth quarter of and the further negative indicators of the economy as a whole  we updated our impairment tests of goodwill and acquired intangible assets and concluded a further impairment had occurred in the carrying amounts of goodwill associated with our medical products segment as well as an impairment in the carrying amounts of goodwill associated with our pharmaceuticals technologies segment 
accordingly  we recorded a further impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of leaving no goodwill on our books as of december  intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets are primarily comprised of technologies acquired through our business combinations 
intangible assets also include in licensed proven medical technologies 
we amortize intangible assets on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the technologies  which range from two to twelve years depending on the circumstances and the intended use of the technology 
we determine the estimated useful lives for intangible assets based on a number of factors such as legal  regulatory or contractual limitations  known technological advances  anticipated demand for our products  and the existence or absence of competition 
we review the carrying value of our intangible assets for impairment indicators at least annually and whenever there has been a significant change in any of these factors listed above 
a significant change in these factors may warrant a revision of the expected remaining useful life of the intangible asset  resulting in accelerated amortization or an impairment charge  which would impact earnings 
we tested our intangible assets for impairment as at september  and determined that there was no impairment 
given the continued decline in our market value in the fourth quarter of and the further negative indicators of the economy as a whole  we updated our impairment tests of intangible assets as at december  and determined that there was no impairment 
results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis of results from our operations excludes the financial results from our discontinued operations see results of operations discontinued operations for the comparative periods  unless otherwise noted 
we completed our acquisition of ami on march  accordingly  the results of ami are not included in our results for the period from january  to the date of acquisition on march  in thousands of us  except per share data years ended december revenues pharmaceutical technologies    medical products    total revenues    operating loss income    other expense income    loss income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting policy  income tax recovery expense    net loss income from continuing operations   basic and diluted net loss income per common share  continuing operations for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss from continuing operations of million basic net loss per share compared to net loss from continuing operations of million basic net loss per share for the year ended december  the increase in the net loss of million is due primarily to the write down of an aggregate of million of goodwill that we recorded in the third and fourth quarters of also increasing the net loss were i a reduction of million in royalty revenue  as bsc s sales of paclitaxel eluting coronary stent systems declined substantially in as compared to prior comparable periods  ii million of transaction costs accrued related to the abandoned proposed api transaction  iii an million write down or loss on redemption of two available for sale equity securities  one of which we disposed of  and the other of which was trading below cost for an extended period of time  iv a million write down of a long term investment for which we could not obtain sufficient assurance we would be able to recover our carrying value  and v a million payment for in process research and development expense made during the first quarter of as compared to million in 
partially offsetting the increase in the net loss were a million increase in gross profit relating to higher medical products sales and a million reduction in interest expense  as the interest rate applied to our floating rate notes declined 
the million we incurred in net loss for the year ended december  as compared to net income of million for the year ended december  is primarily due to i a reduction of million in royalty revenue derived from bsc s sales of paclitaxel eluting coronary stent systems  ii a decrease of million in other royalty revenue due to a non recurring sale to orthovita  inc in of profit sharing rights for certain of their products for million  iii a higher volume of lower margin original equipment manufactured oem product lines  reducing gross profit margins from to  iv an increase of million in sales and marketing salaries as we invested significantly in our sales infrastructure with additions to our direct sales and marketing support personnel in the united states and the european union  v an increase of million for in process research and development ipr d expense  m ainly due to a million payment we made to combinatorx for the extension of our collaboration agreement  vi non recurring charges of million for reorganization activities and personnel reductions relating to the announced plan to close and consolidate our syracuse  ny manufacturing facility  and vii an additional million in interest expense related to debt incurred to partially fund the ami acquisition on march  partially offsetting these factors was an income tax recovery of million in compared to an income tax expense of million in revenues in thousands of us years ended december  pharmaceutical technologies royalty revenue paclitaxel eluting stents  royalty revenue other    license fees  medical products product sales    total revenues    we operate in two reportable segments pharmaceutical technologies our pharmaceutical technologies segment includes royalty revenue generated from licensing our proprietary paclitaxel technology to various partners  as well as revenue derived from the licensing of certain of our biomaterials and other technologies 
royalty revenue derived from sales of paclitaxel eluting coronary stent systems by bsc for the year ended december  decreased by as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in royalty revenues was primarily a result of lower sales of paclitaxel eluting stents by bsc 
royalty revenue for the year ended december  was based on bsc s net sales for the period october  to september  of billion  of which million was in the united states  compared to net sales of billion  of which billion was in the united states  for the comparable period in the prior year 
the average gross royalty rate earned in the year ended december  on bsc s net sales was for sales in the united states and for sales in other countries  compared to an average rate of for sales in the united states and for sales in other countries for the year ended december  the average gross royalty rate for countries other than the united states improved in the year ended december  primarily due to the contribution of royalty revenue from bsc s sales in japan during the period  where the average gross royalty rate we receive is higher  as compared to minimal royalty revenue received relating to sales in japan in the comparable period in the prior year 
royalty revenue derived from sales of paclitaxel eluting coronary stent systems by bsc for the year ended december  decreased by as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in royalty revenues was primarily a result of lower sales of paclitaxel eluting stents by bsc 
royalty revenue for the year ended december  was based on bsc s net sales for the period october  to september  of billion  of which billion was in the united states  compared to net sales of billion  of which billion was in the united states for the comparable periods in the prior year 
the average gross royalty rate earned in the year ended december  on bsc s net sales was for sales in the united states and for sales in other countries compared to an average rate of for sales in the united states and for sales in other countries for the year ended december  other royalty revenue increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  other royalty revenue decreased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the majority of this decrease was due to the non recurring million payment received from orthovita  inc in december  which was classified as royalty revenue in  under an agreement whereby orthovita purchased our profit sharing royalty rights for certain of its products 
we expect revenues in our pharmaceutical technologies segment will decrease into as compared to and  primarily as a result of new competitors entering into the drug eluting coronary stent market in the united states in the second half of and other factors 
our royalties derived from sales by bsc of taxus declined from million in the first half of to million in the second half of medical products our medical products segment manufactures and markets a range of single use  specialty medical devices 
the medical products segment also manufactures finished medical devices and medical device components for third party medical device manufacturers and marketers 
revenue from our medical products segment for the year ended december  was million  an increase of compared to million in the year ended december  the increase was due to several factors  including increased sales of various of our interventional product lines  increased sales of certain of our surgical product lines  the impact of certain new product launches during the year and improvement of sales of medical devices and device components to other third party medical device manufacturers 
this increase also reflects the effect of the one time million charge against revenue in relating to the discontinuation of the contour threads brand and the accrual of a reserve against potential product that may be returned in that year 
excluding the impact of the million accrual in relating to the contour threads brand discontinuation  revenue growth as compared to was 
revenue from our medical products segment for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the year ended december  product revenue in our medical products segment for the year ended december  is not directly comparable to  because the results for only include revenue in this segment from march  the date we completed our acquisition of ami 
we expect that revenues in our medical products segment will continue to increase during as compared to and  reflecting the potential for growth of certain existing and newly launched product lines 
this expected growth may be offset partially by the impact of the difficult economic environment and increasingly difficult credit market and liquidity environment on our customer base  particularly relating to certain third party medical device company customers that purchase medical devices and components from our various manufacturing operations 
expenditures in thousands of us years ended december  license and royalty fees    cost of products sold    research and development    selling  general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    in process research and development    license and royalty fees on royalty revenue license and royalty fee expenses include license and royalty payments due to certain of our licensors  primarily relating to paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system royalty revenue received from bsc 
the decrease in this expense in and reflects the reduction in our royalty revenue 
we expect license and royalty fee expense to continue to be a significant cost in  commensurate with the amount of royalty revenue we earn 
cost of products sold cost of products sold is comprised of costs and expenses related to the production of our various medical device  device component and biomaterial products and technologies  including direct labor  raw materials  depreciation and certain fixed overhead costs related to our various manufacturing facilities and operations 
cost of products sold increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to increased sales 
gross margins for our product sales were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  gross margins in compared to were positively impacted by an increase in sales of higher margin product lines  the launch of certain new  higher margin product lines for which there were no material sales in the comparable prior year period  and the effect of higher sales volumes on the absorption of fixed overhead and labour costs 
cost of products sold increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   primarily because the results did not include a full year of the results of the operations acquired through the ami acquisition which occurred on march  gross margins in our medical products segment were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  gross margins in were impacted by i the one time charge against revenue of million  with no corresponding reduction in cost of products sold  for actual and estimated potential returns of the contour threads brand product relating to a marketing incentive program offered to customers in support of the quill srs product launch and the concurrent discontinuation of the contour threads brand marketing and training support for certain indications of use  ii the overall product sales mix reflecting certain lower margin product lines  and iii certain non recurring costs related to the closure and consolidation of our syracuse  ny manufacturing facility 
we expect that cost of products sold will continue to be significant  and that gross margins may continue to improve in  primarily as a result of improved sales mix  including potential increases in sales of selected product lines that provide higher relative contribution margins  the impact of anticipated higher levels of product sales on the absorption of fixed overhead costs and the reduction in fixed overhead and labor costs relative to certain product sales due to the completion of the consolidation of our syracuse  ny operations  which will result in certain products being manufactured in a lower cost location in puerto rico as well as greater production volume concentrated over fixed overhead costs in our puerto rico location 
these improvements may be offset by the impact of certain sales and pricing initiatives for selected product lines designed to improve sales volume  market share and overall operating cash flow derived from ou r fixed assets 
research and development our research and development expense is comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities  including salaries and benefits  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract research costs  patent procurement costs  materials and supplies  and operating and occupancy costs 
our research and development activities occur in two main areas i discovery and pre clinical research our discovery and pre clinical research efforts are divided into several distinct areas of activity  including screening and pre clinical evaluation of pharmaceuticals and various biomaterials and drug delivery technologies  evaluation of mechanism of action of pharmaceuticals  mechanical engineering and pursuing patent protection for our discoveries 
ii clinical research and development clinical research and development refers to internal and external activities associated with clinical studies of product candidates in humans  and advancing clinical product candidates towards a goal of obtaining regulatory approval to manufacture and market these product candidates in various geographies 
research and development expenses  organized by stage of development  for the periods indicated were as follows in thousands of us years ended december  discovery and pre clinical research    ongoing clinical programs  completed or suspended clinical programs vascular wrap tm paclitaxel eluting mesh   other clinical programs    medical products    stock based compensation   less depreciation  amortization and inter company charges allocated to projects above   total research and development    less research and development relating to discontinued operations total research and development relating to continuing operations    research and development program expenses include all direct costs  as well as certain indirect expenses based on time allocated by certain research  clinical and administrative staff to each program 
research and development expenditures were million in as compared to million in research and development expenditures were up in the first half of  primarily relating to our vascular wrap clinical program  and due to severance costs of million relating to a significant reduction in staffing within our clinical and research departments completed in the second quarter 
this was offset in the second half of by a million decrease in clinical trial costs for our suspended vascular wrap clinical program and a million reduction related to our completed fu cvc clinical program for which significant clinical trial activities have materially concluded 
ongoing clinical programs added million in costs as compared to also adding to research and development expenditures in the second half of were severance costs of million due to a significant additional reduction in staffi ng within our clinical and research departments completed primarily during the third quarter 
research and development expenditures increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the increase was due to a million increase in clinical trial activity mainly associated with our vascular wrap and bio seal programs  the addition of discovery and pre clinical research personnel  an initial payment of million for a new early stage research collaboration  a one time payment of million to terminate a development agreement  and the incurrence of research and development expenses of our medical products segment for a full twelve month period in we currently expect our research and development expenditures may decrease through as compared to and  reflecting the suspension of enrolment in our vascular wrap clinical trial and the reduction or elimination of staffing and other direct costs during relating to certain other research programs and activities 
even after these expected declines  we anticipate we will continue to incur significant research and development expenditures in selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised of direct selling and marketing costs related to the sale of our various medical products  including salaries  benefits and sales commissions  and our various management and administrative support functions  including salaries  commissions  benefits and other operating and occupancy costs 
selling  general and administrative expenditures were million in as compared to million in higher expenditures in salaries  benefits and related costs  accounting and tax consulting fees and travel were offset by lower expenditures for other operating costs and lower litigation expenses in as compared to salaries  benefits and related costs increased by million in primarily due to the increase in direct sales and marketing personnel implemented in the united states and europe during the second half of litigation costs decreased million as compared to the prior year period  due primarily to reaching agreement in the third quarter of with conor medsystems  inc conor and its parent company johnson johnson to settle all outstanding patent litigation with respect to conor s costar paclitaxel eluting stent 
other operating costs decreased by m illion in as compared to due to certain personnel and other cost reduction initiatives undertaken in our general and administrative areas  primarily during the third quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenditures for the year ended december  increased by million to million compared to million in the year ended december  the higher expenditures were primarily due to the fact that results included a full year of medical products selling  marketing  general and administrative costs  as compared to only approximately nine months in also contributing to the increase were additional salaries  benefits  recruiting  and travel costs relating to additions to our direct sales and marketing support personnel in the united states and the european union  and million for severance charges related to the announced plan to close and consolidate our syracuse  ny manufacturing facility 
partially offsetting the increase was a million reduction in legal litigation expense  due primarily to reaching a favorable agreement with conor and its parent company johnson amp  johnson to settle all outstanding patent litigation with respect to conor s costar paclitaxel eluting stent 
during  we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses may be lower than in and due to staff reductions implemented primarily in the third quarter of expenditures could materially increase or fluctuate depending on product sales levels  the timing of launch of certain new products and growth of new product sales  or as a result of litigation or other legal expenses that may be incurred to support and defend our intellectual property portfolio or other aspects of our business 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and is comprised of amortization of licensed technologies and identifiable intangible assets purchased through business combinations of million and million  respectively  and depreciation of property  plant and equipment of million and million  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and is comprised of amortization of licensed technologies and identifiable intangible assets purchased through business combinations of million and million  respectively  and depreciation of property  plant and equipment of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in amortization expense in is primarily due to a one time expense of million in for accelerated amortization of the intangible assets related to the monetization of the profit sharing royalty stream from orthovita  inc we expect depreciation and amortization expense to remain consistent in as compared to in process research and development ipr d we record ipr d expense relating to acquired or in licensed technologies that are at an early stage of development and have no alternative future use 
for the year ended december   we recorded ipr d expense of million for an initial license payment made to rex medical lp to obtain the marketing rights for the option inferior vena cava filter 
for the year ended december   we recorded ipr d expense of million  of which million relates to the extension of our collaboration with combinatorx inc and million relates to a collaboration agreement with rex medical lp for the year ended december   we recorded ipr d expense of million as a result of license milestone payments made to poly med  inc in accordance with a license agreement 
we may incur further ipr d expenditures in future periods in the event we in license or acquire additional early stage technologies 
other income expense in thousands of us years ended december  foreign exchange loss gain investment and other income    interest expense on long term debt    write down and other deferred financing charges  write down of assets held for sale  write down or net loss on redemption of investments  write down of goodwill  net foreign exchange gains and losses were primarily the result of changes in the relationship of the us to canadian dollar and other foreign currency exchange rates when translating our foreign currency denominated cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to us dollars for reporting purposes at period end 
we continue to hold foreign currency denominated cash and cash equivalents to meet our anticipated operating and capital expenditure needs in future periods in jurisdictions outside of the united states 
we do not use derivatives to hedge against exposures to foreign currency arising from our balance sheet financial instruments and therefore are exposed to future fluctuations in the us dollar to foreign currency exchange rates 
investment and other income for the year ended december  decreased by million when compared to  primarily due to the fact that the comparative period included a gain of million realized on the recovery of investments owned by cohesion technologies  inc which we acquired in in addition  we earned lower interest income in due primarily to lower cash balances available to invest and lower interest rates 
investment and other income for the year ended december  increased by million when compared to  primarily due to a gain in the first quarter of of million realized on the recovery of investments owned by cohesion technologies  inc which we acquired in  offset partially by a reduction in investment income due to a lower cash balance available to invest because of the use of cash resources for the acquisitions of ami and quill and the write off of certain capitalized tax assets totalling million related to the ami acquisition 
during the year ended december   we incurred interest expense of million on our outstanding long term debt obligations  as compared to million for the decrease of million has resulted from a decline  during  in the interest rate applicable on our floating rate notes due to a decline in the libor rates 
the interest rate decline resulted in an average interest rate of for as compared to in interest expense in also includes million for amortization of deferred financing costs 
during the year ended december   we incurred interest expense of million on our outstanding long term debt obligations  as compared to million for the increase is primarily because our debt obligations that were issued in connection with our acquisition of ami on march  were not outstanding for the full twelve month comparative period of also contributing to the increase  the interest rate on our floating rate notes is higher than the rate on the credit facility that they replaced 
interest expense for also includes million for amortization of deferred financing costs 
during the year ended december   we incurred interest expense of million on our outstanding long term debt obligations 
the senior secured term loan was extinguished in december and replaced with the floating rate notes 
during march to december  the period  the senior secured term loan was in place  interest rates ranged between and and the interest rate on the subordinated notes remained fixed at 
interest expense in also includes million for amortization of deferred financing costs 
in  we recognized costs of million related to our exploration of proposed financing and strategic alternatives 
during the year ended december   we recognized a write down of million of deferred financing costs related to the extinguishment of the senior secured term loan 
in connection with our plans for capacity rationalization and consolidation in the medical products segment  we reclassified two of its long lived assets as current assets held for sale in accordance with guidance in sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
these properties have a carrying value of approximately million  which represents the lower of cost and fair value less cost to sell 
an impairment charge of million has been recorded against income from continuing operations 
in addition  and also in connection with our capacity rationalization in the pharmaceutical technology segment  we reclassified a property that is no longer used and has a carrying value of approximately million as held for sale 
the write down or net loss on redemption of investments for the year ended december  of million is comprised of a loss of million realized on the sale of our common stock holdings in combinatorx  inc  an unrealized loss of million on an available for sale equity security that has been trading below carrying value for an extended period and for which management does not intend to hold for a sufficient period of time to reasonably expect a recovery to initial carrying value and an unrealized loss of million on the write down in carrying value of shares held in a private biotechnology company classified as long term investments 
the write down or net loss on redemption of investments for the year ended december  of million is comprised of a loss of million realized on the sale of our common stock holdings in orthovita  inc  partially offset by a gain of million realized on the sale of our common stock holdings in nuvasive  inc as a result of the significant and sustained decline in our public market capitalization  we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
upon conclusion of such testing  we determined that the carrying amounts of goodwill associated with our medical products segment were impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of the goodwill impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill assigned to our medical products segment with the implied fair value of the goodwill 
we utilized the income approach in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill  which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows discounted using estimated discount rates 
given the continued decline in our market value in the fourth quarter of  we updated our impairment tests of goodwill and acquired intangible assets and concluded a further impairment had occurred in the carrying amounts of goodwill associated with our medical products segment as well as an impairment in the carrying amounts of goodwill associated with our pharmaceutical technologies segment 
accordingly  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of  leaving no goodwill on our balance sheet as of december  income tax income tax recovery for the year ended december  was million compared to income tax recovery of million for the year ended december  the income tax recovery for is primarily due to a net loss from operations  the amortization of identifiable intangible assets  tax deductions relating to international financing structures  and a recovery of taxes paid in prior years as a result of the carryback of current year losses 
the income tax recovery for also includes a recovery of million relating to the settlement of an outstanding quebec income tax reassessment and a charge of million related to an accrual under fin the effective tax rate for was compared to an effective tax rate of for the effective tax rate for is lower than the statutory canadian tax rate of  primarily due to valuation allowances on net operating losses  tax deductions related to international financing structures  provincial income tax credits  the net effect of lower tax rates on earnings in foreign jurisdictions  and goodwill impairment charges 
for the year ended december   income tax recovery of million consisted of a current and deferred income tax recovery of million on a net loss from canadian operations and a current and deferred income tax recovery of million on net losses from us and foreign operations 
discontinued operations in september  we determined that certain operating subsidiaries acquired through the ami acquisition were not aligned with our business strategy and we began actively looking to dispose of these subsidiaries 
the operations were categorized as discontinued and the net loss for these operations has been shown separately on the statements of operations of these subsidiaries 
on july   we completed the sale of of the issued and outstanding shares of point technologies  inc and its subsidiary point technologies sa for proceeds of million 
on august   we sold all of the assets and liabilities of american medical instruments dartmouth  inc for proceeds of million 
the operating results of discontinued operations are summarized as follows in thousands of us years ended december  revenue   operating loss  other income and expense  impairment charge   loss before income taxes   income tax recovery   net loss from discontinued operations   liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of million and cash resources of million  consisting of cash and cash equivalents 
in aggregate  our working capital decreased by million as compared to december   primarily relating to the decline in our royalty revenues derived from sales of paclitaxel eluting coronary stent systems by bsc as described previously and our loss on redemption and write down of equity securities 
these cash resources  in addition to cash generated from operations  are used to support our continuing clinical studies  research and development initiatives  sales and marketing initiatives  working capital requirements  debt servicing requirements and for general corporate purposes 
we may also use our cash resources to fund acquisitions of  or investments in  businesses  products or technologies that expand  complement or are otherwise related to our business 
on march  we announced we had completed a financing transaction with wells fargo foothill  llc 
the financing includes a delayed draw secured term loan facility of up to million and a secured revolving credit facility  with a borrowing base comprised of certain of our finished goods inventory and accounts receivable  providing up to an additional million in available credit  subject to certain terms and conditions 
at any time  the amount of financing available under the revolving credit facility may be significantly less than million and is expected to fluctuate from month to month with changes in levels of finished goods and accounts receivable 
as of february   the amount of financing available under the revolving credit facility was approximately unaudited million 
any borrowings outstanding under the term loan and revolving credit facility bear interest ranging from libor to libor  with a minimum base libor rate of 
the term loan and revolving credit facility include certain covenants and restrictions with respect to our operations and require us to maintain certain levels of ebitda and interest coverage ratios  among other terms and conditions 
repayment of any amounts drawn under the term loan and revolving credit facility can be made at certain points in time with ultimate maturity being february  amounts repaid under the secured term loan  and prepayments made under the revolving credit facility in certain circumstances  cannot be re borrowed by us 
the purpose of this financing is to provide additional liquidity and capital resources for working capital and general corporate purposes 
as the minimum base libor rate under the term loan and revolving credit facility is and the libor rate was on december   a 
increase or decrease in the libor rate as of december  would have no impact on interest payable under the credit facilities 
on march  we completed an offering of million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes in a private placement transaction  and entered into a million senior secured credit facility consisting of a million senior term loan facility maturing in and a million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in none of the million revolving credit facility was drawn 
the net proceeds from the sale of the million senior subordinated notes and the million term loan  as well as cash on hand  were used to finance the acquisition of ami 
in december  we repaid the term loan with the proceeds from the issuance of senior floating rate notes due in the aggregate principal amount of million and cash on hand 
we also terminated the million revolving credit facility 
the significant terms relating to our subordinated notes and floating rate notes are described below see senior floating rate notes and senior subordinated notes 
due to numerous factors that may impact our future cash position  working capital and liquidity as discussed below and the significant cash that will be necessary to continue to service our current level of debt obligations  there can be no assurance that we will have adequate liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our financial obligations beyond our cash inflows and the amounts of expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  including but not limited to changes in drug eluting coronary stent markets  including the impact of new competitive entrants into such markets and research relating to the efficacy of drug eluting stents  the sales achieved in such markets by our partner bsc  the timing and success of product sales and marketing initiatives and new product launches  the timing and success of our research  product development and clinical trial activities  the timing of completing certain operational initiatives including facility closures  our ability to effect reductions in certain aspects of our budgets in an efficient and timely manner  and changes in interest rates 
these and other uncertainties may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources to a significant extent and may force us to further reduce our expen ditures on research and development or on our various new product and sales and marketing initiatives in order for us to continue to service our debt obligations 
such further reductions in our budgeted expenditures may have an adverse effect on our new product development and sales growth initiatives and reduce our ability to achieve the revenue growth targets  product launch or new product development timelines in our current operating plan 
there can also be no assurance that such reductions in expenditures will be adequate to provide enough cash flow to continue to service our current level of debt obligations 
in particular  should our royalties received from bsc decline more significantly than we expect in future periods as a result of new competitive entrants into the us drug eluting stent market and due to negative research or publications relating to the efficacy of drug eluting stents  our liquidity has been and may continue to be adversely affected  and we have been forced to explore alternative funding sources through debt  equity or other public or private securities offerings  or to pursue certain reorganization  restructuring or other strategic alternatives 
we may not be able to complete any restructuring  reorganization or strategic activities on terms that would be favourable for our shareholders 
capital markets conditions deteriorated significantly during and early  including a significant and material decline in the level of corporate lending activity  combined with a significant increase in the cost of any such lend ing 
current market conditions may have a material impact on our ability to complete any of the activities as described on favourable terms  if at all 
as a result of uncertainty and volatility relating to the market and competitive environment for drug eluting stents and to address our liquidity needs  we commenced the exploration of a broad range strategic and financial alternatives in the second half of see business overview financial and strategic alternatives process

working capital requirements resulted in net cash outflows of million during compared to net cash inflows of for the net cash outflows in primarily resulted from a million increase during the year in trade accounts receivable  consistent with the increase in medical product sales as compared to  an increase of million during the year of inventory balances built in order to meet production requirements for certain of our medical products in the united states and europe and a decrease of million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to lower spending 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash provided of million for net loss for the current year  excluding non cash items  resulted in cash outflows of million compared to cash inflows of million for the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to factors consistent with those that impacted net loss  as described above under results of operations overview 
working capital requirements resulted in cash inflows of million during compared to cash outflows of million for cash inflows related to working capital for primarily resulted from a million decrease in trade accounts receivable due to focused collection efforts and slightly higher trade and tax payables balances 
partially offsetting these net inflows was a decrease in other accounts payable as a million milestone payable accrued at december  was paid during cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash provided of million for for  the net cash used in investing activities was primarily related to capital expenditures of million 
we also paid a million licensing milestone to a partner upon our successful completion of enrollment in our bio seal human clinical trial and invested million in ipr d for an initial license payment to rex medical lp these cash outflows were offset by proceeds on sale of short term investments of million 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash used of million for for  cash provided by investing activities was primarily from the proceeds on the sale of long term assets  and the funds were used for the acquisition of r d assets including intangible assets  ipr d and equipment

we invest our excess cash balances in short term marketable securities  principally investment grade commercial debt and government agency notes 
the primary objectives of our marketable securities portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return while meeting our two primary objectives 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our objectives  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
as of december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
interest rate risk as the issuer of the floating rate notes  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
the interest rate on the floating rate notes is reset quarterly to month libor plus 
the aggregate principal amount of the floating rate notes is million and the notes bear interest at a rate of approximately at december  at december  
based upon the average floating rate debt levels of the company during the year  a basis point increase in interest rates would have impacted our interest expense by approximately million for each of the years ended december  and we do not use derivatives to hedge against interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk we operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
as such  our financial results are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements in relation to the us dollar 
our foreign currency exposures are primarily limited to the canadian dollar  the swiss franc  the danish kroner  the euro and the uk pound sterling 
we incurred foreign exchange gain of million for the year ended december  million foreign exchange loss for the year ended december  primarily as a result of changes in the relationship of the us to canadian dollar and other foreign currency exchange rates when translating our foreign currency denominated cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to us dollars for reporting purposes at period end 
we have not entered into any forward currency contracts or other financial derivatives to hedge foreign exchange risk  and therefore we are subject to foreig n currency transaction and translation gains and losses 
we purchase goods and services in us and canadian dollars  swiss francs  danish kroner  euros  and uk pounds sterling  and earn a significant portion of our license and milestone revenues in us dollars 
foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by satisfying foreign denominated expenditures with cash flows or assets denominated in the same currency 
since we operate internationally and approximately of our net revenue for the year ended december  was generated in other than the us dollar  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could significantly impact our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and competitive position 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we used a sensitivity analysis to measure the potential impact to our consolidated financial statements for a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar compared with the canadian dollar  the swiss franc  the danish kroner  the euro and the uk pounds sterling for the year ended december  assuming a strengthening of the us dollar  our product net revenue would have been negatively impacted by approximately million
