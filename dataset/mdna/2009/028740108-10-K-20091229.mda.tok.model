our company we are a leading manufacturer of fine and specialty chemicals within our focused markets 
our fine chemicals products represent the active pharmaceutical ingredient api or registered intermediate in certain anti viral  oncology and central nervous system drugs 
our specialty chemicals and aerospace equipment products are utilized in national defense programs and provide access to  and movement in  space  via solid propellant and propulsion thrusters 
our technical and manufacturing expertise and customer service focus has gained us a reputation for quality  reliability  technical performance and innovation 
given the mission critical nature of our products  we maintain long standing strategic customer relationships 
we work collaboratively with our customers to develop customized solutions that meet rigorous federal and international regulatory standards 
we generally sell our products through long term contracts under which we are the sole source or limited source supplier 
we are the only north american producer of ammonium perchlorate  or ap  which is the predominant oxidizing agent for solid propellant rockets  booster motors and missiles used in space exploration  commercial satellite transportation and national defense programs 
in order to diversify our business and leverage our strong technical and manufacturing capabilities  we have made three strategic acquisitions in recent years 
each of these acquisitions provided long term customer relationships with sole source and limited source contracts and leadership positions in growing markets 
on october   we acquired the former atlantic research corporation s liquid in space propulsion business from aerojet general corporation  which became our aerospace equipment segment 
effective october   we further expanded our aerospace equipment segment with the acquisition of marotta holdings limited subsequently renamed ampac isp holdings limited and its wholly owned subsidiaries collectively ampac isp holdings 
our us based aerospace equipment operation is one of two major north american manufacturers of monopropellant and bipropellant liquid propulsion systems and thrusters for satellites  launch vehicles  and interceptors 
ampac isp holdings designs  develops and manufactures high performance valves  pressure regulators  cold gas propulsion systems  and precision structures for 
table of contents space applications  especially in the european space market 
on november   we acquired gencorp inc s fine chemicals business  through our wholly owned subsidiary ampac fine chemicals llc afc  which is now our fine chemicals segment 
our fine chemicals segment is a leading custom manufacturer of certain active pharmaceutical ingredients  or apis  and registered intermediates for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
our business segments our operations comprise four reportable business segments i fine chemicals  ii specialty chemicals  iii aerospace equipment and iv other businesses 
the following table reflects the revenue contribution percentage from our business segments and each of their major product lines for the years ended september fine chemicals specialty chemicals perchlorates sodium azide halotron total specialty chemicals aerospace equipment other businesses real estate water treatment equipment total other businesses total revenues less than fine chemicals 
our fine chemicals segment is a custom manufacturer of apis and registered intermediates 
the pharmaceutical ingredients we manufacture are used by our customers in drugs with indications in three primary areas anti viral  oncology  and central nervous system 
we generate nearly all of our fine chemicals sales from manufacturing chemical compounds that are proprietary to our customers 
we operate in compliance with the us food and drug administration s the fda current good manufacturing practices cgmp and other regulatory agencies such as the european union s european medicines agency and japan s pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency 
our fine chemicals segment s strategy is to focus on high growth markets where our technological position  combined with our chemical process development and engineering expertise  leads to strong customer allegiances and limited competition 
we have distinctive competencies and specialized engineering capabilities in performing chiral separations  manufacturing chemical compounds that require high containment and performing energetic chemistries at commercial scale 
we have invested significant resources in our facilities and technology base 
we believe we are the us leader in performing chiral separations using commercial scale simulated moving bed  or smb  technology and own and operate two large scale smb machines  both of which are among the largest in the world operating under cgmp 
we believe our distinctive competency in manufacturing chemical compounds that require specialized high containment facilities and handling expertise provide us a significant competitive advantage in competing for various opportunities associated with high potency  highly toxic and cytotoxic products 
many oncology drugs are made with apis that are high potency or cytotoxic 
afc is one of the few companies in the world that can manufacture such compounds at a multi ton annual rate 
moreover  our significant experience and specially engineered facilities make us one of the few companies in the world with the capability to use energetic chemistry on a commercial scale under cgmp 
we use this capability in development and production of products such as those used in anti viral drugs  including hiv related and influenza combating drugs 
we have established long term  sole source and limited source contracts  which help provide us with earnings stability and visibility 
in addition  the inherent nature of custom pharmaceutical fine chemicals 
table of contents manufacturing encourages stable  long term customer relationships 
we work collaboratively with our customers to develop reliable  safe and cost effective  custom solutions 
once a custom manufacturer has been qualified as a supplier on a cgmp product  there are several potential barriers that discourage transferring the manufacturing of the product to an alternative supplier  including the following alternative supply may not be readily available 
we are currently the sole source supplier on several of our fine chemicals products 
regulatory approval 
applications to and approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities generally require the chemical contractor to be named 
switching contractors may require additional regulatory approvals and could take as long as two years to complete 
significant financial costs 
switching contractors and amending various filings can result in significant costs associated with technology transfer  process validation and re filing with the fda and other regulatory authorities 
specialty chemicals 
our specialty chemicals segment is principally engaged in the production of ap 
in addition  we produce and sell sodium azide  a chemical used in pharmaceutical manufacturing  and halotron  a series of clean fire extinguishing agents used in fire extinguishing products ranging from portable fire extinguishers to total flooding systems 
we have supplied ap for use in space and defense programs for over years and we have been the only ap supplier in north america since  when we acquired the ap business of our principal competitor  kerr mcgee chemical corporation  or kmcc 
a significant number of existing and planned space launch vehicles use solid propellant and thus depend  in part  upon our ap 
many of the rockets and missiles used in national defense programs are also powered by solid propellant 
for fiscal our largest programs were the space shuttle reusable solid rocket motor rsrm  the guided multiple launch rocket system gmlrs and the atlas family of commercial space launch vehicles 
alliant techsystems inc or atk is our largest ap customer 
we sell grade i ap to atk under a long term contract that requires us to maintain a ready and qualified capacity for grade i ap and that requires atk to purchase its grade i ap requirements from us  subject to certain terms and conditions 
the contract  which expires in  provides fixed pricing in the form of a price volume matrix for annual grade i ap volumes ranging from million to million pounds 
pricing varies inversely to volume and includes annual escalations 
aerospace equipment 
our aerospace equipment segment reflects the operating results of our wholly owned subsidiary ampac isp corp 
and its wholly owned subsidiaries  which include the recently acquired ampac isp holdings beginning as of october  the combination of our existing in space propulsion operations in westcott  uk  with ampac isp holdings constitutes ampac isp europe 
our aerospace equipment segment is one of two major north american manufacturers of monopropellant and bipropellant liquid propulsion systems and thrusters for satellites  launch vehicles  and interceptors 
our products are utilized on various satellite and launch vehicle programs such as space systems loral s series geostationary satellites 
ampac isp europe designs  develops and manufactures high performance valves  pressure regulators  cold gas propulsion systems  and precision structures for space applications  especially in the european space market 
these products are used on various satellites and spacecraft  as well as on the ariane launch vehicle 
other businesses 
our other businesses segment contains our water treatment equipment and real estate activities 
our water treatment equipment business designs  manufactures and markets systems for the control of noxious odors  the disinfection of water streams and the treatment of seawater 
our real estate activities are not material 

table of contents results of operations revenues year ended september  percentage change vs

fine chemicals specialty chemicals aerospace equipment other businesses total revenues fine chemicals 
for fiscal  the decrease in fine chemicals segment revenues  compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily reflects declines in core product revenues from anti viral products of  central nervous system products of  and oncology products of 
historically  revenues from development products are approximately of fine chemicals segment revenues 
in fiscal  development product revenues were approximately of fine chemicals segment revenues 
development product revenues include revenues from research products  products which are not yet commercialized  and products which are commercial but for which we are not the current commercial producer 
we see a continuing trend toward more outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry 
consequently  while  in fiscal  development product revenues as a percentage of fine chemicals segment revenues remained at historical levels  we expect that this percentage will increase going forward 
typically  development product activities are the source for future core products 
anti viral product revenues declined in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as a result of an approximately reduction in volume for the anti viral product that was our largest core product in fiscal volume decline for this product is due to our customer s supply chain strategy and their desire to reduce their current levels of inventory 
revenue declines for this product were partially offset by increases in revenues from one of our other core anti viral products 
the decrease in central nervous system product revenues resulted from a customer reducing its orders for the product until calendar year fine chemicals segment revenues increased  in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year primarily driven by increased volume for anti viral products 
specifically  the volume for our largest measured in terms of revenues anti viral product increased by to support our customer s increase in safety stock inventory of the final drug 
volume for our second largest anti viral product increased by in support of increases in demand for our customer s end product 
volume for our largest oncology product declined in fiscal because fiscal included additional quantities purchased by our customer to build on hand safety stock quantities 
fine chemicals segment revenues are anticipated to decline slightly in fiscal with fiscal  reflecting a substantial increase in development product revenues to approximately of segment revenues  offset by declines in core product revenues 
we currently anticipate that the reduced demand for certain of our core products as a result of order deferrals and demand moving further into the future  which we began experiencing in fiscal  will continue in fiscal we believe that the anticipated increase in development product activities should contribute to the longer term growth of our core product portfolio as several of the development products that are currently in the clinical stages are showing positive signs for commercial approval 
specialty chemicals 
specialty chemicals segment revenues include revenues from our perchlorate  sodium azide and halotron product lines  with perchlorates comprising   and of specialty chemicals revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the year over year variances in specialty chemicals revenues reflect the following factors 
table of contents a decrease in perchlorate volume and a increase in the related average price per pound for fiscal a increase in perchlorate volume in fiscal and a decline in the related average price per pound 
sodium azide revenues increased in fiscal and decreased in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal year 
halotron revenues decreased in fiscal and increased in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in perchlorate volume for fiscal is primarily due to the completion of the minuteman iii propulsion replacement program in fiscal offset partially by increases in demand for space and tactical missile programs 
for fiscal  the greatest contribution to segment revenue was product for the space shuttle rsrm program 
the average price per pound increased for fiscal primarily due to the effect of our contractual price volume matrix  under which price and volume move inversely 
in addition  we sold more specialized blend product than in the comparable prior fiscal year periods 
for fiscal  our largest programs were the minuteman iii propulsion replacement program  the rsrm program  the gmlrs missile and the ares next generation space exploration vehicles 
the average price per pound of perchlorate sold in fiscal decreased compared to fiscal due to higher total sales volume of grade i ap in fiscal compared to fiscal specialty chemicals segment revenues are expected to decline by approximately in fiscal  which we believe is within our expected stable range for this non growth segment 
perchlorate demand is expected to decline by approximately in fiscal from fiscal the effect of the demand decline is substantially offset by contractual price increases based on our contractual price volume matrix  under which price has an inverse relationship to total annual volume 
over the longer term  we expect annual demand for grade i ap to be within the range of million to million pounds based on current nasa and us department of defense production programs 
however  ap demand could increase if there is an extension to the space shuttle program  an acceleration of the ares next generation space exploration vehicles program  and or a substantial increase in space exploration activity 
in addition  grade i ap revenues are typically derived from a relatively few large orders 
as a result  quarterly revenue amounts can vary significantly depending on the timing of individual orders throughout the year 
average price per pound may continue to fluctuate somewhat in future periods  depending upon product mix and volume 
the changes in sodium azide revenues in fiscal and fiscal are due primarily to fluctuation in demand for sodium azide used in pharmaceutical applications  with the fiscal increase in revenues due to increased sales outside the us we do not anticipate a significant increase in demand for sodium azide 
changes in halotron revenues are driven by volume changes which have been and are expected to be relatively consistent year over year 
aerospace equipment 
our aerospace equipment segment reflects the operating results of our wholly owned subsidiary ampac isp corp 
and its wholly owned subsidiaries collectively  isp 
as noted above  effective as of october   we acquired marotta holdings limited subsequently renamed ampac isp holdings limited and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
combined with our existing aerospace equipment segment operations in westcott  uk  these operations constitute ampac isp europe 
for fiscal  aerospace equipment segment revenues increased  due to both organic growth and the ampac isp holdings acquisition 
ampac isp holdings contributed  in revenues 
the remainder of the revenue increase is primarily attributed to this segment s us operations which 
table of contents experienced success with new contract awards  beginning in the latter part of fiscal this improvement in backlog resulted in significant revenue increases for propulsion systems in fiscal see below for further discussion of backlog 
in fiscal  the our aerospace equipment segment s high performance dual mode lbf bipropellant engine dst h was chosen by orbital sciences for the commercial orbital transportation services cots for their taurus ii launch vehicle  which will supply cargo to the international space station 
the dst h provides industry leading performance in an attitude control system engine 
in fiscal  aerospace equipment segment revenues declined compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decline is primarily due to the awards of new contracts occurring in the later part of fiscal  and accordingly did not produce as much revenue within fiscal fiscal aerospace equipment segment contract awards included a contract to develop a liquid divert and attitude control system dacs for the ballistic missile defense system 
the work applies proven component and subsystem design to develop a modular and scalable dacs 
the program leverages isp s design for manufacturing experience to develop a low cost  low risk propulsion system for interceptor kill vehicles 
the cost plus fixed fee contract  of approximately  is anticipated to culminate in the delivery of a qualification unit and two flight test units in september isp is teamed with moog inc space and defense group  east aurora  new york  which will provide subsystem design and component support 
initial funding from general dynamics advanced information systems to initiate the landsat data continuity mission contract 
the expected value of the contract is approximately  to deliver a propulsion system for the landsat satellite 
this satellite is funded by nasa goddard and provides earth observation for land and water resource planning 
a contract by microsat systems to provide propulsion systems to be used on the orbcomm og program 
the initial multimillion dollar contract for systems also has an option for another systems 
orbcomm satellites provide gps data for tracking and global satellite data communications 
other businesses 
other businesses segment revenues include pepcon systems water treatment equipment and related spare parts sales and real estate revenues 
water treatment equipment sales increased  in fiscal and in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal years 
the revenue increases were driven by new system sales

revenues cost of revenues gross margin gross margin percentage in addition to the factors detailed below  one of the most significant factors that affects  and should continue to affect  the comparison of our consolidated gross margins from period to period is the change in revenue mix between our segments 
fiscal cost of revenues increased  or  to  from  for the prior fiscal year 
the consolidated gross margin percentage declined to compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the following factors affect our fiscal consolidated gross margin comparisons fine chemicals segment gross margin percentage for fiscal declined by approximately eight points  reflecting the following o a decrease in the gross margin percentage due to lower production volume and the related impact on gross margin due to less absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
table of contents o during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the implementation of a new process for a large volume core anti viral product which experienced start up difficulties that negatively impacted margins for this product for the first half of fiscal o a decrease in revenues for central nervous system products  including a price reduction for a large volume core product 
specialty chemicals segment gross margin percentage improved two points for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a reduction in amortization expense from  for fiscal to zero for fiscal in mid fiscal second quarter  the specialty chemicals segment completed the amortization of the value assigned to the perchlorate customer list acquired in the fiscal year ended september  aerospace equipment segment gross margin percentage improved two points for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
the improvement was primarily driven by the ampac isp europe operations which experienced gross margin increases due to greater volumes 
this improvement was offset somewhat by lower aggregate margins due to a change in product mix to a greater portion of propulsion systems in fiscal as compared to engines in fiscal fiscal cost of revenues increased  or  to  from  for the prior fiscal year 
the consolidated gross margin percentage declined to compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the following factors affect our fiscal consolidated gross margin comparisons fine chemicals segment gross margin percentage for fiscal declined five points compared to the prior fiscal year  reflecting the following o our product mix changed such that fiscal contained a greater percentage of lower margin products than fiscal o during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented a new process for a large volume anti viral product and experienced start up difficulties 
this negatively impacted margins 
specialty chemicals segment gross margin percentage improved approximately eight points for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year  reflecting the following o mid fiscal second quarter  the specialty chemicals segment completed the amortization of the value assigned to the perchlorate customer list acquired in the fiscal year ended september  this reduction in amortization expense improved the specialty chemicals segment gross margin percentage by four points for fiscal o the remaining improvement in the specialty chemicals segment gross margin percentage reflects better absorption of fixed manufacturing costs due to the higher production volume in fiscal aerospace equipment segment gross margin percentage was the same in fiscal and fiscal operating expenses year ended september  percentage change vs

fine chemicals specialty chemicals aerospace equipment other businesses total segment operating profit corporate expenses environmental remediation charges operating income segment operating income includes all sales and expenses directly associated with each segment 
environmental remediation charges  corporate general and administrative costs and interest are not allocated to segment operating results 
fluctuations in segment operating income or loss are driven by changes in segment revenues  gross margins and operating expenses  each of which is discussed in greater detail above 
backlog agreements with our fine chemicals segment customers typically include multi year supply agreements 
these agreements may contain provisional order volumes  minimum order quantities  take or pay provisions  termination fees and other customary terms and conditions  which we do not include in our computation of backlog 
fine chemicals segment backlog includes unfulfilled firm purchase orders received from a customer  including both purchase orders which are issued against a related supply agreement and stand alone purchase orders 
fine chemicals segment backlog was  and  as of september  and  respectively 
we anticipate order backlog as of september  to be substantially filled during fiscal our aerospace equipment segment is a government contractor  and accordingly  total backlog includes both funded backlog contracts  or portions of contracts  for which funding is contractually obligated by the 
table of contents customer and unfunded backlog contracts  or portions of contracts  for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer 
we compute aerospace equipment segment total and funded backlog as the total contract value less revenues that have been recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
aerospace equipment segment total backlog and funded backlog were approximately  and  respectively  as of september  compared to total backlog and funded backlog of  and  as of september  we anticipate funded backlog as of september  to be substantially completed during fiscal the acquisition of ampac isp holdings contributed approximately  to total and funded backlog as of september  backlog is not a meaningful measure for our other business lines 
interest and debt repayment charges year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
interest and other income interest income gain on sale of assets other total interest expense debt repayment charges we earn interest income on our cash and cash equivalents balances 
interest income varies with these balances and the applicable interest rate 
in fiscal  the gain on sale of assets relates to the final recognition of a deferred gain from a sale lease back transaction in october in fiscal  the lease was terminated and the associated deferred gain was recognized 
interest expense was consistent between fiscal and fiscal because there were no changes in our underlying primary credit facility and the interest rate is fixed 
interest expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to our refinancing activities in february which reduced the average interest rate on our long term debt to 
prior to our refinancing  our variable rate long term debt had a weighted average interest rate of as of december  income taxes 
our income tax expense benefit rate differs from the federal statutory rate due to state income taxes  amounts that were expensed for book purposes that are not deductible for income tax purposes  changes in our valuation allowances  and other adjustments to our estimates of tax liabilities 
a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to our effective tax benefit rate is as follows for the years ended september 
table of contents federal income tax at the statutory rate state income tax  net of federal benefit nondeductible expenses valuation allowance change in effective state income tax rate interest and penalties foreign tax rate differential other effective tax rate deferred tax assets are comprised of the following at september deferred tax assets environmental remediation reserves pension obligations tax credits and carryforwards intangible assets inventory accrued expenses other subtotal valuation allowance deferred tax assets deferred tax liabilities property  plant and equipment prepaid expenses other deferred tax liabilities net deferred tax assets the following summarizes our tax credits and carryforwards as of september federal operating losses federal r d credits federal amt credits state operating losses uk operating losses ireland operating losses federal operating loss carryforwards  expiring in  federal r d credits and federal amt credits are available to reduce future federal taxable income 
we do not anticipate future taxable income in the states that have operating loss carryforwards and have provided a full valuation allowance of because of a history of losses in foreign tax jurisdictions  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that we will not utilize these operating loss carryforwards and  accordingly  have provided aggregate valuation allowances of  and as of september  and  respectively 
we have not provided a us federal income tax for our foreign operations because we intend to permanently reinvest any foreign earning 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of changes in exchange rates on cash net change in cash for period operating activities fiscal compared to fiscal operating activities provided cash of  for fiscal compared to  for the prior fiscal year  resulting in a decrease of significant components of the change in cash flow from operating activities include a decrease in cash due to a decline in cash profits generated by our operations of  an increase in cash used for working capital accounts of  excluding the effects of interest and income taxes 
a decrease in cash taxes paid of  a decrease in cash interest of an increase in cash used for environmental remediation of other increases in cash provided by operating activities of  the increase in cash used for working capital accounts is primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements to support the revenue growth of our aerospace equipment segment 
in addition  accounts receivable balances for our specialty chemicals segment were higher as of september  due to higher revenues in september these higher accounts receivable balances were substantially collected in october we consider these working capital changes to be routine and within the normal production cycle of our products 
the production of most fine chemical products requires a length of time that exceeds one quarter 
in addition  the timing of aerospace equipment segment revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method differs from the timing of the related billings to customers 
therefore  in any given quarter  accounts receivable  work in progress inventory or deferred revenues can increase or decrease significantly 
we expect that our working capital may vary normally by as much as  from quarter to quarter 
for fiscal  we do not anticipate paying federal income taxes based on the anticipated reduction in income and the effects of timing differences in expense deductions 
as a result  cash tax requirements are significantly reduced in fiscal compared to fiscal other increases in cash provided by operating activities primarily reflect the timing of contributions to our defined benefit pension plans 
fiscal compared to fiscal cash flows from operating activities decreased by  significant components of the change in cash flow from operating activities include 
table of contents a decrease in cash due to a decline in cash profits generated by our operations of  an improvement in cash used to fund working capital increases of  excluding the effect of interest and income taxes 
an increase in cash taxes paid of  an increase in cash used for interest payments of  a reduction in cash used for environmental remediation of other decreases in cash used for operating activities of cash used by working capital accounts improved during fiscal primarily due to reductions in inventory levels  primarily at afc 
the benefit to cash from reductions in inventory levels was partially offset by reductions in accrued liabilities and deferred revenues 
cash tax payments increased due to the improvement in our pre tax income and the negative effects of tax basis inventory adjustments 
cash used for interest increased primarily due to the timing of our interest payments 
our current debt instruments require semi annual interest payments in february and august compared to the debt instruments in place through february which required interest payments at the end of each quarter 
cash used for environmental remediation decreased because during the fiscal first quarter we were in the construction phase of our henderson  nevada remediation project compared to the lower cash requirements of the operating and maintenance phase which began in the fiscal second quarter 
investing activities fiscal compared to fiscal capital expenditures decreased by  in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to reductions in growth capital spending for our fine chemicals segment 
we are anticipating our capital expenditures  which do not include environmental remediation spending  for fiscal to range from approximately  to approximately  most of which is related to maintenance capital 
cash used for acquisition of business reflects the purchase of ampac isp holdings for  net of cash acquired of fiscal compared to fiscal capital expenditures increased by  the increase included an increase in capital expenditures at our corporate offices of  primarily due to the relocation of our headquarters and an increase in capital expenditures by our fine chemicals segment that included the upgrade of an existing production line to better handle new projects and the installation of equipment in support of a long term project 
financing activities financing cash flows for fiscal and fiscal primarily reflect capital lease payments and cash flows associated with stock option exercises 
fiscal also includes purchases of treasury stock 
financing cash flows for fiscal are primarily related to the issuance of the senior notes in february to refinance the then existing credit facilities 
see discussion under the heading long term debt and revolving credit facilities below 
liquidity and capital resources 
as of september   we had cash of  our primary source of working capital is cash flows from operations 
in addition  we have available funds under our committed revolving credit line  which matures in february our revolving line of credit 
table of contents had availability of  as of september  availability is computed as the total commitment of  less outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit  if any 
we believe that changes in cash flow from operations during fiscal reflect short term timing and as such do not represent significant changes in our sources and uses of cash 
because our revenues  and related customer invoices and collections  are characterized by relatively few individually significant transactions  our working capital balances can vary normally by as much as  from period to period 
we may incur additional debt to fund capital projects  strategic initiatives or for other general corporate purposes  subject to our existing leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing limitations imposed by our lenders 
the availability of our cash inflows is affected by the timing  pricing and magnitude of orders for our products 
from time to time  we may explore options to refinance our borrowings 
the timing of our cash outflows is affected by payments and expenses related to the manufacture of our products  capital projects  pension funding  interest on our debt obligations and environmental remediation or other contingencies  which may place demands on our short term liquidity 
although we are not currently party to any material pending legal proceedings  we are from time to time subject to claims and lawsuits related to our business operations and we have incurred legal and other costs as a result of litigation and other contingencies 
we may incur material legal and other costs associated with the resolution of litigation and contingencies in future periods 
if such costs are material  to the extent not covered by insurance  they would adversely affect our liquidity 
in contemplating the adequacy of our liquidity and available capital  we consider factors such as current results of operations  cash flows and backlog  anticipated changes in operating trends  including anticipated changes in revenues and margins  and cash requirements related to our debt agreements  pension plans and remediation activities 
specifically  in fiscal  we considered our recorded environmental remediation charge in the amount of  of that amount  approximately  represents the amounts that we currently expect to spend through the next two years for the engineering  design  installation and cost of additional remediation equipment remediation capital 
we anticipate funding these expenditures with cash on hand 
further  accounting charges for environmental remediation and cash spent for remediation capital do not impact our bank covenant compliance charges 
see further discussion under the heading environmental remediation ampac henderson site below 
we do not currently anticipate that the factors noted above will have material affects on our ability to meet our future liquidity requirements 
we continue to believe that our cash flows from operations  existing cash balances and existing or future debt arrangements will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of our operations on both a short term and long term basis 
long term debt and revolving credit facilities senior notes 
in february  we issued and sold  aggregate principal amount of senior notes due february  collectively  with the exchange notes issued in august as referenced below  the senior notes 
proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to repay our former credit facilities 
the senior notes accrue interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually in february and august

in connection with the closing of the sale of the senior notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement which required us to file a registration statement to offer to exchange the senior notes for notes that have substantially identical terms as the senior notes and are registered under the securities act of  as amended 
in july  we filed a registration statement with the sec with respect to an offer to exchange the senior notes as required by the registration rights agreement  which registration statement was declared effective by the sec 
in august  we completed the exchange of of the senior notes for substantially identical notes which are registered under the securities act of  as amended 
revolving credit facility 
in february  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement  as amended as of july  the revolving credit facility  with wachovia bank  national association  and certain other lenders  which provides a secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to  with an initial maturity of years 
we may prepay and terminate the revolving credit facility at any time 
the annual interest rates applicable to loans under the revolving credit facility are  at our option  either the alternate base rate or libor rate each as defined in the revolving credit facility plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is tied to our total leverage ratio as defined in the revolving credit facility 
in addition  we pay commitment fees  other fees related to the issuance and maintenance of letters of credit  and certain agency fees 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by and secured by substantially all of the assets of our current and future domestic subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility contains certain negative covenants restricting and limiting our ability to  among other things 
table of contents incur debt  incur contingent obligations and issue certain types of preferred stock  create liens  pay dividends  distributions or make other specified restricted payments  make certain investments and acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of assets 
financial covenants under the revolving credit facility include quarterly requirements for total leverage ratio of less than or equal to to total leverage ratio  and interest coverage ratio of at least to interest coverage ratio 
the revolving credit facility defines total leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda and interest coverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense 
with respect to these covenant compliance calculations  consolidated ebitda  as defined in the revolving credit facility hereinafter  referred to as credit facility ebitda  differs from typical ebitda calculations and our calculation of adjusted ebitda  which is used in certain of our public releases and in connection with our incentive compensation plan 
the most significant difference in the credit facility ebitda calculation is the inclusion of cash payments for environmental remediation as part of the calculation 
the following statements summarize the elements of those definitions that are material to our computations 
consolidated funded debt generally includes principal amounts outstanding under our senior notes  revolving credit facility  capital leases and notional amounts for outstanding letters of credit 
credit facility ebitda is generally computed as consolidated net income loss plus income tax expense benefit  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  and stock based compensation expense and less cash payments for environmental remediation and other non recurring gains in excess of in accordance with the definitions contained in the revolving credit facility  as of september   our total leverage ratio was to and our interest coverage ratio was to 
the revolving credit facility also contains usual and customary events of default subject to certain threshold amounts and grace periods  including cross default provisions that include our senior notes 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  we may be required to repay the obligations under the revolving credit facility prior to its stated maturity and the related commitments may be terminated 
we do not believe that it is reasonably likely  in the near or long term  that we will be in violation of our debt covenants 
as of september   under our revolving credit facility  we had no borrowings outstanding and availability of  availability is computed as the total commitment of  less outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit  if any 
pension benefits 
we maintain three defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all of our us employees  excluding employees of our aerospace equipment segment the amended and restated american pacific corporation defined benefit pension plan  the ampac fine chemicals llc pension plan for salaried employees the afc salaried plan  and the ampac fine chemicals llc pension plan for bargaining unit employees the afc bargaining plan  each as amended and restated 
collectively  these three plans are referred to as the pension plans 
the afc salaried plan and the afc bargaining plan were established in connection with our acquisition of the afc business and include the assumed liabilities for pension benefits to existing employees at the acquisition date 
pension plan benefits are paid based on an average of earnings  retirement age  and length of service  among other factors 
benefit obligations are measured annually as of september as of september   the pension plans had an unfunded benefit obligation of  for fiscal and fiscal  we made contributions to the pension plans in the amounts of  and  respectively 
we anticipate making minimum pension plan contributions in the amount of  during fiscal we are required to make minimum contributions to our pension plans pursuant to the minimum funding requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and the employee retirement income 
table of contents security act of  as amended 
in accordance with federal requirements  our minimum funding obligations are determined annually based on a measurement date of october the fair value of pension plan assets is a key factor in determining our minimum funding obligations 
holding all other variables constant  a decline in asset value as of september  would increase our minimum funding obligations for fiscal by approximately in addition  we have the american pacific corporation supplemental executive retirement plan  as amended and restated the serp that  as of september   included four executive officers and one former executive officer 
the serp is an unfunded plan and as of september   the serp obligation was  for fiscal and fiscal  we paid retirement benefits of and  respectively 
we anticipate paying retirement benefits in the amount of during fiscal payments for retirement benefits should increase in future years when each of the four active participants retires 
the future increase in retirement benefits will be determined based on certain variables including each participating individual s actual retirement date  rate of compensation and years of service 
during fiscal  our aggregate pension plans and serp liability increased significantly primarily due to changes in actuarial assumption such as the discount rate 
the change was recorded as an increase in pension obligations and a corresponding decrease in shareholders equity accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the increase in pension obligation is not anticipated to cause a material change in our fiscal funding requirements 
debt issue costs and debt repayment charges 
in connection with the repayment of our prior credit facilities in february  we recorded a charge for approximately  to write off the unamortized balance of debt issue costs associated with those facilities 
in addition  we paid a pre payment penalty of to terminate our second lien credit facility 
these charges are presented as debt repayment charges in our statement of operations 
in connection with the issuance of the senior notes  we incurred debt issuance costs of approximately  which were capitalized and classified as other assets on the balance sheet 
these costs are being amortized as additional interest expense over the eight year term on the senior notes 
environmental remediation ampac henderson site 
during the third quarter of our fiscal year ended september   we recorded a charge for  representing our estimate of the probable costs of our remediation efforts at the ampac henderson site  including the costs for capital equipment  operating and maintenance o m  and consultants 
the project consisted of two primary phases the initial construction of the remediation equipment phase and the o m phase 
during the fiscal year ended september   we increased our total cost estimate of probable costs for the construction phase by  due primarily to changes in the engineering designs  delays in receiving permits and the resulting extension of construction time 
isb is a new technology on the scale being used at the ampac henderson site 
accordingly  as we gain isb operational experience  we have been and are observing certain conditions  operating results and other data which we consider in updating the assumptions used to determine our costs estimates 
the two most significant assumptions are the estimated speed of groundwater flowing to our remediation extraction wells and the estimated annual o m costs 
late in fiscal  we gained additional information from groundwater modeling that indicates groundwater emanating from the ampac henderson site in certain areas in deeper zones more than feet below ground surface is moving toward our existing remediation facility at a much slower pace than previously estimated 
utilization of our existing facilities alone  at this lower groundwater pace  could  according to this recently created groundwater model  extend the life of our remediation project to well in excess of fifty years 
as a result of this additional data  we re evaluated our remediation operations 
this evaluation indicates that we should be able to significantly reduce the total project time  and ultimately the total cost of the project  by installing additional groundwater extraction wells in the deeper  more concentrated areas  thereby providing for a more aggressive remediation treatment 
the additional wells and related remediation equipment will incorporate above ground treatment to supplement or possibly replace by consolidation our existing isb process 
with the additional extraction wells and equipment  we estimate that the total remaining project life for the existing and new  more aggressive deep zone systems could range from to years 
within that range  we estimate that a range of to years is more likely 
groundwater speed  
table of contents perchlorate concentrations  aquifer characteristics and forecasted groundwater extraction rates continue to be key variables underlying our estimate of the life of the project 
if additional information becomes available in the future that is different than information currently available to us  our estimate of the resulting project life could change significantly 
we currently estimate that the cost to engineer  design  and install this additional equipment is approximately  and we anticipate that these amounts will be spent and the new equipment operational in approximately two years 
however  because we are in the early design and engineering steps  this estimate involves a number of significant assumptions 
due to uncertainties inherent in making early stage estimates  our estimate may later require significant revision as new facts become available and circumstances change 
in addition to accruing approximately  for engineering  design  installation and cost of additional equipment  we increased our estimate of total remaining o m costs by  due primarily to incremental o m costs to operate and maintain the additional equipment once installed 
the sum of the estimated costs for the additional equipment and incremental o m totals  which was recorded as a charge to earnings in our fiscal fourth quarter 
total o m expenses are currently estimated at approximately  per year and estimated to increase to approximately  per year after the additional equipment becomes operational 
to estimate o m costs  we consider  among other factors  the project scope and historical expense rates to develop assumptions regarding labor  utilities  repairs  maintenance supplies and professional service costs 
if additional information becomes available in the future that is different than information currently available to us and thereby lead us to different conclusions  our estimate of o m expenses could change significantly 
in addition  certain remediation activities are conducted on public lands under operating permits 
in general  these permits require us to return the land to its original condition at the end of the permit period 
estimated costs associated with removal of remediation equipment from the land are not material and are included in our range of estimated costs 
as of september   the aggregate range of anticipated environmental remediation costs was from approximately  to approximately  based on a possible total remaining life of the project ranging from to years 
the accrued amount was  based on years  or the low end of the more likely range of to years as no amount within the range was more likely 
these estimates are based on information currently available to us and may be subject to material adjustment upward or downward in future periods as new facts or circumstances may indicate 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our fiscal year contractual obligations and commitments as of september  payments due by year ending september  thereafter total senior notes interest on senior notes at annually capital leases interest on capital leases operating leases total in addition to the contractual obligations listed in the table above  at september  we have recorded an estimated liability for environmental remediation of  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we expect to spend approximately  for environmental remediation during fiscal we have recorded aggregate pension plans and serp obligations of  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we expect to contribute  to our pension plans and serp during fiscal 
table of contents we have uncertain tax positions totaling we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the related payments  if any 
we also maintain the revolving credit facility  which provides revolving credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to  with an initial maturity in february at september   we had no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we may prepay and terminate the revolving credit facility at any time 
off balance sheet arrangements letters of credit 
as of september   we had  in outstanding standby letters of credit which mature through july these letters of credit principally secure performance of certain water treatment equipment sold by us and payment of fees associated with the delivery of natural gas and power 
employee agreements 
we have an employment agreement with dr 
joseph carleone  our chief executive officer as of january  the term of the employment agreement currently ends on september   unless amended or extended in accordance with the terms of the agreement or otherwise 
significant contract provisions include annual base salary  health care benefits  and non compete provisions 
the employment agreement is primarily an at will employment agreement  under which we may terminate the executive officer s employment for any or no reason 
generally  the agreement provides that a termination without cause obligates us to pay certain severance benefits specified in the contract 
effective as of july   we entered into severance agreements with each of our vice president  administration and our chief financial officer  which  generally  provide that a termination of the executive without cause obligates us to pay certain severance benefits specified in the contract 
in addition  certain other key divisional executives are eligible for severance benefits 
estimated minimum aggregate severance benefits under all of these agreements and arrangements was  as of september  inflation generally  inflation did not have a material or significant effect on our sales and operating revenues or costs during the three year period ended september  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires that we adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgment  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
sales and revenue recognition 
revenues from our specialty chemicals segment  fine chemicals segment  and other businesses segment are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
almost all products sold by our fine chemicals segment are subject to customer acceptance periods 
specifically  these customers have contractually negotiated acceptance periods from the time they receive certificates of analysis and compliance 
table of contents certificates to reject the material based on issues with the quality of the product  as defined in the applicable agreement 
at times we receive payment in advance of customer acceptance 
if we receive payment in advance of customer acceptance  we record deferred revenues and deferred costs of revenue upon delivery of the product and recognize revenues in the period when the acceptance period lapses or the customer s acceptance has occurred 
some of our perchlorate and fine chemicals products customers have requested that we store materials purchased from us in our facilities bill and hold transactions or arrangements 
we recognize revenue prior to shipment of these bill and hold transactions when we have satisfied the criteria included in the relevant accounting standard  which include the point at which title and risk of ownership transfer to our customers 
these customers have specifically requested in writing  pursuant to a contract  that we invoice for the finished product and hold the finished product until a later date 
for our bill and hold arrangements that contain customer acceptance periods  we record deferred revenues and deferred costs of revenues when such products are available for delivery and certificates have been delivered to the customers 
we recognize revenue on our bill and hold transactions in the period when the acceptance period lapses or the customer s acceptance has occurred 
the sales value of inventory  subject to bill and hold arrangements  at our facilities was  and  as of september  and  respectively 
revenues from our aerospace equipment segment are derived from contracts that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method and measure progress on a cost to cost basis 
contract revenues include change orders and claims when approved by the customer 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue as work on a contract progresses 
revenues are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
for fixed price and fixed price incentive contracts  if at any time expected costs exceed the value of the contract  the loss is recognized immediately 
we do not incur material pre contract costs 
depreciable or amortizable lives of long lived assets 
our depreciable or amortizable long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  which are recorded at cost 
depreciation or amortization is recorded using the straight line method over the shorter of the asset s estimated economic useful life or the lease term  if the asset is subject to a capital lease 
economic useful life is the duration of time that we expect the asset to be productively employed by us  which may be less than its physical life 
significant assumptions that affect the determination of estimated economic useful life include wear and tear  obsolescence  technical standards  contract life  and changes in market demand for products 
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness  especially in light of changed business circumstances 
for example  changes in technological advances  changes in the estimated future demand for products  or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated 
in these cases  we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
likewise  if the estimated useful life is increased  the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
impairment of long lived assets 
we test our property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such circumstances include  but are not limited to  operating or cash flow losses from the use of such assets or changes in our intended uses of such assets 
to test for recovery  we group assets an asset group in a manner that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
our asset groups are typically identified by facility because each facility has a unique cost overhead and general and administrative expense structure that is supported by cash flows from products produced at the facility 
the carrying amount of an asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 

table of contents if we determine that an asset group is not recoverable  then we would record an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value 
fair value is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
the assumptions underlying cash flow projections would represent management s best estimates at the time of the impairment review 
some of the factors that management would consider or estimate include industry and market conditions  sales volume and prices  costs to produce and inflation 
changes in key assumptions or actual conditions which differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
we would use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews but cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 
when we review asset groups for recoverability  we also consider depreciation estimates and methods or the amortization period  in each case as required by applicable accounting standards 
any revision to the remaining useful life of a long lived asset resulting from that review also is considered in developing estimates of future cash flows used to test the asset group for recoverability 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis  as of september  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit could be below its carrying amount 
the impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill  and  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount of goodwill in excess of its implied fair value 
environmental costs 
we are subject to environmental regulations that relate to our past and current operations 
we record liabilities for environmental remediation costs when our assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
on a quarterly basis  we review our estimates of future costs that could be incurred for remediation activities 
in some cases  only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated 
in establishing our reserves  the most probable estimate is used  otherwise  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
estimates of liabilities are based on currently available facts  existing technologies and presently enacted laws and regulations 
these estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new circumstances 
accrued environmental remediation costs include the undiscounted cost of equipment  operating and maintenance costs  and fees to outside law firms and consultants  for the estimated duration of the remediation activity 
estimating environmental cost requires us to exercise substantial judgment regarding the cost  effectiveness and duration of our remediation activities 
actual future expenditures could differ materially from our current estimates 
we evaluate potential claims for recoveries from other parties separately from our estimated liabilities 
we record an asset for expected recoveries when recoveries of the amounts are probable 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  separately for each tax paying entity in each tax jurisdiction  using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
when measuring deferred tax assets  we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established 
a valuation allowance is established if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the assessment of valuation allowance requirements  if any  involves significant estimates regarding the timing and amount of reversal of taxable temporary differences  future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
we rely on deferred tax liabilities in our assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets if the temporary timing difference is anticipated to reverse in the same period and jurisdiction and are of the same character as the temporary differences giving rise to the deferred tax assets 
we weigh both 
table of contents positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that a valuation allowance is required 
as of september   recovery of our us jurisdiction deferred tax assets  net of applicable deferred tax liabilities  required that we generate approximately  in taxable income in periods ranging from one to at least years in the future 
to determine whether a valuation allowance is required  we project our future taxable income 
the projections require us to make assumptions regarding our product revenues  gross margins and operating expenses 
for our us tax jurisdictions  the most significant positive evidence is our historical long term trend of profitable operations and our forecast that such trend will continue in future periods when temporary differences are anticipated to reverse 
positive evidence also includes the lack of reliance on success in implementing tax planning strategies  utilization of short carry back periods or appreciated asset values 
further  we do not have a history of tax credits expiring unused 
for foreign tax jurisdictions  the most compelling negative evidence is a history of unprofitable operations 
accordingly  we have fully reserved our foreign deferred tax assets 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with an accounting standard which creates a single model to address uncertainty in income tax positions and prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
the standard also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under this standard  we may recognize tax benefits from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the issue 
the amount recognized is the largest benefit that we believe has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations  and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
pension benefits 
we sponsor four defined benefit pension plans in various forms for employees who meet eligibility requirements 
applicable accounting standards require that we make assumptions and use statistical variables in actuarial models to calculate our pension obligations and the related periodic pension expense 
the most significant assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
additional assumptions include the future rate of compensation increases  which is based on historical plan data and assumptions on demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
depending on the assumptions selected  pension expense could vary significantly and could have a material effect on reported earnings 
the assumptions used can also materially affect the measurement of benefit obligations 
the discount rate is used to estimate the present value of projected future pension payments to all participants 
the discount rate is generally based on the yield on aaa aa rated corporate long term bonds 
at september of each year  the discount rate is determined using bond yield curve models matched with the timing of expected retirement plan payments 
our discount rate assumption was percent as of september  holding all other assumptions constant  a hypothetical increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate assumption would increase or decrease annual pension expense by approximately the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the plan funds invested in a specific target asset allocation 
the expected long term rate of return assumption on pension plan assets was percent in fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in the assumed long term rate of return would increase or decrease annual pension expense by approximately recently issued or adopted accounting standards 
in september  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued a new standard which defines fair value  establishes a 
table of contents framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb deferred this standard for one year as it applied to certain items  including assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination  reporting units and certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value in connection with goodwill impairment tests  and long lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessments 
the standard applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
this standard was effective for us on october   however  we did not adopt all the provisions of the standard as the fasb delayed the effective date of its application to non financial assets and liabilities 
the remaining provisions became effective for us beginning october  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued a new standard that will significantly change the accounting for business combinations 
under the standard  an acquiring entity is required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
the standard also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
the standard applies to us prospectively for business combinations with acquisition dates on or after october  we expect that it will have an impact on our accounting for future business combinations  but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time 
in december  the fasb issued a new standard that establishes revised accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  the standard requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
it also clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
the standard requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
the standard also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
the standard was effective for us beginning on october  we currently have no entities or arrangements that were affected by the adoption of this standard 
in april  the fasb issued a new standard which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the standard for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset shall be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
however  the disclosure requirements must be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized in our financial statements as of the effective date 
the standard was effective for us beginning october  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued a new standard that provides guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan 
the objectives of the disclosures include disclosure of investment allocation decisions  major categories of plan assets  inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets  the effect of certain fair value measurements  and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
the expanded disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in april  a new standard was issued that provides additional guidance for estimating fair value  when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
the standard also includes guidance on how to identify circumstances that indicate that a transaction is not orderly and 
table of contents emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability and regardless of the valuation techniques used  the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same 
the standard was effective for us beginning with our interim period ended june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued a new standard that provides authoritative accounting literature related to evaluating subsequent events that was previously addressed only in certain auditing literature 
the standard is similar to the current guidance with some exceptions that are not intended to result in significant change to current practice 
the standard defines subsequent events and also requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date 
we adopted the disclosure provisions under this new standard as of june  the adoption did not have an impact on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued a standard that establishes the fasb s accounting standards codification the codification as the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied to nongovernmental entities  and rules and interpretive releases of the sec as authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification supersedes all the existing non sec accounting and reporting standards upon its effective date 
the establishment of the codification is not intended to change or alter existing us gaap 
the codification changed the references of financial standards in effect for us 
any specific references made to gaap in our consolidated financial statements use the new codification numbering system prescribed by the fasb 
the codification is effective in the first interim and annual periods ending after september  we adopted the codification for our financial statements prepared as of september  the adoption did not have any impact on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands we have limited exposure to market risk 
currently  we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
as of september   our outstanding debt is comprised primarily of  aggregate principal of the senior notes 
we estimate that the fair value of the senior notes to be approximately  based on the trade date closest to september   which was september  to the extent we may be subject to interest rate risk  our exposure is primarily due to changes in market interest rates as compared to the fixed rate for the senior notes 
at september   we had no amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the interest payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and  therefore  to the extent we draw down on such facility in the future  it could be affected by changes in market interest rates 
although we do have a significant amount of export sales  to date these transactions have been settled mostly in us dollars and  therefore  we believe we have only minimal exposure at present to foreign currency exchange risks 
historically  we have not hedged our currency risk and do not currently anticipate doing so in the future 
however  it is possible that in the future a growing number of our export sales could be made in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and other currencies may subject us to foreign currency exchange risks in the future
