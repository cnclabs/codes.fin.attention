you should read the following discussion and analysis along with the selected financial data and the financial statements and notes attached to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview we were incorporated in june from our inception through december   our activities related primarily to establishing and operating a biotechnology research and development organization and developing relationships with our corporate collaborators 
our scientific and business development endeavors currently focus on the engineering of novel zinc finger dna binding proteins zfps for the regulation and modification of genes 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  borrowings  payments from research grants and from corporate collaborators and strategic partners 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our revenues have consisted primarily of revenues from our corporate partners for zfp transcription factors zfp tfs and zfp nucleases zfns  contractual payments from strategic partners for research programs and research milestones  and research grant funding 
we expect revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period and there can be no assurance that new collaborations or partner fundings will continue beyond their initial terms 
in the development of our zfp technology platform we have continued to place more emphasis internally on higher value therapeutic product development and less on our enabling technology applications 
we believe this shift in emphasis has the potential to increase the return on investment to our stockholders by allocating capital resources to higher value  therapeutic product development activities 
at the same time  it may reduce our revenues over the next several years and subject us to higher financial risk by increasing expenses associated with product development 
we have filed investigational new drug ind applications with the us food and drug administration fda and have initiated three phase clinical trials of a zfp therapeutic in subjects with diabetic neuropathy and one phase clinical trial in subjects with als 
we are also conducting a phase clinical trial to evaluate a zfp therapeutic for the treatment of hiv aids 
development of novel therapeutic products is costly and is subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process by the fda 
our future products are gene based therapeutics 
adverse events in both our own clinical program and other programs may have a negative impact on regulatory approval  the willingness of potential commercial partners to enter into agreements and the perception of the public 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel expenses  stock based compensation expenses  laboratory supplies  pre clinical and clinical studies  manufacturing expenses  allocated facilities expenses  subcontracted research expenses and expenses for trademark registration and technology licenses 
research and development costs incurred in connection with collaborator funded activities are expensed as incurred 
costs to acquire technologies that are utilized in research and development and that have no alternative future use are expensed as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and 
table of contents development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
we expect these expenses will increase as we focus on development of zfp therapeutics 
additionally  in order to develop zfp tfs and zfns as commercially relevant therapeutics  we expect to expend additional resources for expertise in the manufacturing  regulatory affairs and clinical research aspects of biotherapeutic development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  stock based compensation expenses  professional fees  allocated facilities expenses  patent prosecution expenses and other general corporate expenses 
as we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads we expect the business aspects of the company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
such estimates are described in note organization and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  and evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions

we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in the future and expect research and development expenses to increase in the next several years if we are successful in advancing our zfp therapeutic product candidates into clinical trials 
to the extent we collaborate with others with respect to clinical trials  increases in research and development expenses may be reduced or avoided 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase of million in from was primarily due to increased pre clinical and clinical studies and manufacturing expenses of million  primarily associated with our diabetic neuropathy program and increased salaries and personnel expenses of million  including increased stock based compensation expenses of million 
the increase in stock based compensation was due to increased grant activity  higher black scholes value per share and a lower estimated forfeiture rate which the company believes is more representative of its historical experience 
consulting expenses increased by  primarily in support of our diabetic neuropathy program  and facility expenses increased by  primarily due to the company leasing additional space 
this was partially offset by decreased expenses related to licensing and external research of  the increase of million in from was primarily due to increased pre clinical and clinical studies and manufacturing expenses of million  primarily associated with

our current research and development programs are focused on the advancement of our zfp tf technology for several potential applications 
among these are zfp therapeutics for neurological disorders  hiv aids  cancer and monogenic diseases  zfp engineered cell lines  protein production and zfp tfs and zfns for applications in agricultural biotechnology

material cash inflows associated with the sale of products  if any  which result from our research efforts are not expected for at least five years 
see risk factors our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process  and if these potential products are not approved  we will not be able to commercialize these products and our gene regulation and gene modification technology is relatively new  and if we are unable to use this technology in all our intended applications  it would limit our revenue opportunities 
prior to january   due to the early stage of our various internal research and development projects  we did not track costs associated with our internal projects on a project by project basis 
since january   management categorizes research and development expenses by project 
the table below shows research and development expenses for our two primary clinical development projects  sb and sb t  as well as expenses associated with all other projects in our research and development pipeline 
other projects consist primarily of numerous pre clinical research projects and activity associated with various research collaborations

in july  pursuant to a laboratory research reagents license agreement with sigma  the company issued one million shares of common stock valued at per share to sigma  resulting in proceeds of million 
in june  in an underwritten public offering and pursuant to an effective registration statement  we sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriter s discount 
all other cash provided by financing activities for and was related to proceeds from issuance of common stock related to stock option exercises 
while we expect our rate of cash usage to increase in the future  in particular  to support our product development endeavors  we believe that the available cash resources  funds received from corporate collaborators  strategic partners and research grants will be sufficient to finance our operations through we may need to raise additional capital to fund our zfp therapeutic development activities 
additional capital may not be available in terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  our business and our ability to develop our technology and our zfp therapeutic products would be harmed 

table of contents there is no provision for income taxes because we have incurred losses 
as of december   sangamo had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire in the years through the company also has state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in the years through the company also has federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal research credits will begin to expire in the year through and the state research credits have no expiration date 
utilization of the company s net operating loss may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before use
