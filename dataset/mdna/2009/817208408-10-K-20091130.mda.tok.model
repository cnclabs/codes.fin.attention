item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations incorporated by reference to management s discussion and analysis appearing in the annual report  contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this form k  the following are important risk factors which could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
most utility solutions segment sales are to or for the utility industry  known for long sales cycles and uncertainty  which could affect the timing of revenue 
most of the utility solutions segment s sales are to or for the utility industry  where sales cycles are long and often unpredictable due to budgeting  purchasing and regulatory approval processes that can take up to several years to complete 
most aclara sales involve large dollar amounts  and are marked by extended and complex competitive procurements 
these factors often cause delays in the timing of sales  and such delays could result in order postponement  reduction in size or cancellation  thereby reducing or delaying the company s future revenue 
in addition  delays in the receipt of grants by certain utility customers under the american recovery and reinvestment act of may cause delays in the placement of orders with aclara 
also  these customers selection of vendors may be influenced by the specific terms of such grants  such as buy american requirements  which may prohibit the supply by aclara of products produced outside the us negative worldwide economic conditions and related credit shortages could result in a decrease in the company s sales and an increase in its operating costs  which could adversely affect its business and operating results 
if there is a worsening of current global and us economic and financial market conditions and additional tightening of global credit markets  many of the company s customers may further delay or reduce their purchases of its products 
the current uncertainties in the global economy may cause the utility industry to experience shortages in available credit  which could limit capital spending 
to the extent this problem affects customers of the utility solutions segment  the sales and profits of this segment could be adversely affected 
likewise  if the company s suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit  they may have to increase their prices or become unable to continue to offer the products and services the company uses to manufacture its products  which could have an adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
credit shortages could affect the pricing of the company s credit facility increase option 
tightening of the global credit markets could cause an increase in the pricing or fees related to the company s overall credit facility if the company exercises its million increase option 
a significant portion of the utility solutions segment revenues may be generated by a limited number of large contracts 
a significant portion of the utility solutions segment s business may be dependent on several large contracts with customers 
the loss of revenue which would result from such a customer s selection of other suppliers  cancellations  delays  reductions  regulatory actions or the company s failure to perform in connection with such a contract could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s quarterly results may fluctuate substantially 
the company has experienced variability in quarterly results and believes its quarterly results will continue to fluctuate as a result of many factors  including the size and timing of customer orders  federal communications commission or other governmental actions  changes in existing taxation rules or practices  the gain or loss of significant customers  timing and levels of new product developments  shifts in product or sales channel mix  increased competition and pricing pressure  and general economic conditions affecting enterprise spending for the utility industry 
failure or delay in new product development could reduce the company s future sales 
much of the company s business is dependent on the continuous development of new products and technologies to meet the changing needs of the company s markets on a cost effective basis 
many of these markets are highly technical from an engineering standpoint  and the relevant technologies are subject to rapid change 
if the company fails to timely enhance existing products or develop new products  sales opportunities could be lost  which would adversely affect business 
in addition  in some existing contracts with customers  the company has made commitments to develop and deliver new products 
if the company fails to meet these commitments  the default could result in the imposition of contractual penalties including termination 
the inability to enhance existing products in a timely manner could make the products less competitive  while the inability to successfully develop new products may limit growth opportunities 
delays in product development may also require greater investment in research and development 
increased costs associated with new product development and product enhancements could adversely affect operating results 
the costs of new product development may not be recoverable if demand for the products is not as anticipated 
a significant portion of the company s capitalized software is subject to impairment risk based on the ability to market the software 
a significant portion of the company s capitalized software value is contingent on the future sales of twacs ng software 
failure to generate sufficient sales to recoup costs could result in the impairment of the capitalized software costs 
certain manufacturing operations are dependent on a small number of third party suppliers a significant part of the utility solutions segment s manufacturing operations relies on a small number of third party manufacturers to supply the segment s products 
for example  aclara has arrangements with four manufacturers which produce and supply substantially all of aclara s end products 
two of these suppliers produce these end products in mexico 
a significant disruption for example  a strike in the supply of those products could negatively affect the timely delivery of aclara s products to customers and future sales 
also  most of doble s manufacturing operations rely on third party manufacturers to supply its products 
disruption in the supply of critical components such as integrated circuit components could have an adverse impact on business by  among other things  increasing costs and reducing margins 
certain of the company s other businesses are dependent upon sole source or a limited number of third party manufacturers of parts and components 
many of these suppliers are small businesses 
since alternative supply sources are limited  there is an increased risk of adverse impacts on the company s production schedules and profits if the company s suppliers were to default in fulfilling their price  quality or delivery obligations 
product defects could result in costly fixes  litigation and damages 
if there are claims related to defective products under warranty or otherwise  particularly in a product recall situation  the company could be faced with significant expenses in replacing or repairing the product 
for example  the aclara meter modules are installed in thousands of residences and other buildings 
the replacement repair costs for such products  if defective  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
also  the filtration segment obtains raw materials  machined parts and other product components from suppliers who provide certifications of quality which are relied on by the company 
should these product components be defective and pass undetected into finished products  there could be significant costs to the company for repairs  re work or replacement 
in addition  if a dispute over product claims cannot be settled  arbitration or litigation may result  involving attorneys fees and the potential of damage awards against the company 
increases in raw material prices and decreased availability of raw materials could adversely affect the company s business 
the cost of raw materials is a major element of the total cost of many of the company s products 
for example  the test segment s critical components rely on purchases of raw materials from third parties 
increases in the prices of raw materials such as steel  copper  nickel  zinc  wood and petrochemical products could have an adverse impact on business by  among other things  increasing costs and reducing margins 
in addition  the company s reliance on sole or limited sources of supply of raw materials in each of its segments could adversely affect the business 
weather created disruptions in supply  in addition to affecting costs  could impact the company s ability to procure an adequate supply of these raw materials and delay or prevent deliveries of products to customers 
economic  political and other risks of the company s international operations could adversely affect business 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s sales were made to international customers 
an economic downturn or an adverse change in the political situation in certain foreign countries in which the company does business could cause a decline in revenues and adversely affect the company s financial condition 
for example  the test segment does significant business in asia and europe 
changes in the asian political climate or political changes in specific asian countries could negatively affect the company s business 
weakness in the european economy could have a significant adverse effect on the company s european revenues 
for example  doble lemke gmbh is based in germany and could be negatively impacted by weakness in the european economy 
the company s international sales are also subject to other risks inherent in foreign commerce  including currency fluctuations and devaluations  the risk of war and terrorism  differences in foreign laws  uncertainties as to enforcement of contract rights  and difficulties in negotiating and resolving disputes with foreign customers 
sales of government products depend upon continued government funding 
during the past three fiscal years  from to of the company s revenues have been generated from sales to the us government or its contractors 
these sales are dependent on continuous government funding of its programs 
there could be reductions or terminations of the government funding on programs which are applicable to the company or its customers 
these funding effects could adversely affect the company s sales and profit  and could bring about a restructuring of company operations  which could result in an adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
for example  a significant part of vacco s sales involve major us government defense and space programs 
government reduction in spending on these programs could have a significant adverse impact on company financial results 
the end of customer product life cycles could negatively affect filtration segment results 
many of the company s filtration products are sold to be components in the customers end products 
if a customer discontinues a certain end product line  the ability of the company to continue to sell those components will be reduced or eliminated 
the result could be a significant decrease in company sales 
for example  a substantial portion of pti s revenue is generated from commercial aviation aftermarket sales 
as certain aircraft are retired and replaced by newer aircraft  there could be a corresponding decrease in sales associated with the company s current products 
such a decrease could adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  if the government cuts back the space program  vacco s sales of space products would be reduced  and its revenues could be adversely affected 
acquisitions of other companies carry risk 
acquisitions of other companies involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the potential exposure to unanticipated and undisclosed liabilities  the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase  the potential loss of key personnel  suppliers or customers of acquired businesses and the diversion of management s time and attention from other business concerns 
although management will attempt to identify and evaluate the risks inherent in any future transaction  the company may not properly ascertain all such risks 
despite its efforts  the company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property 
despite the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property  unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use the company s products and technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect the company s proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
current and future actions to enforce the company s proprietary rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  and may not be successful 
in addition  the company may not elect to pursue an unauthorized user due to the high costs and uncertainties associated with litigation 
the company may also face exposure to claims by others challenging its intellectual property rights 
changes in test standards could adversely impact test segment sales 
a significant portion of the test segment s business involves sales to technology customers  which results from these customers needing to meet specific international and domestic test standards 
if demand for product testing from these customers decreases  the company s business could be adversely affected 
likewise  if regulatory agencies eliminate or reduce certain domestic or international test standards  the company s sales could be adversely affected 
for example  if it were determined that there is no need to include wi fi technology in mobile phones  there may be no need for certain testing on mobile phones 
also  if a regulatory authority relaxes the test standards for certain electronic devices because they do not interfere with the broadcast spectrum  sales of certain test products could be reduced 
disputes with contractors could adversely affect the test segment s costs 
a major portion of the test segment s business involves working in conjunction with general contractors to produce end products  such as electronic test chambers  secure communication rooms  mri facilities  etc 
if there are performance problems caused by either the company or a contractor  these often result in cost overruns and may lead to a dispute as to which party is responsible 
the resolution of such disputes can result in arbitration or litigation  and could involve significant expense including attorneys fees 
in addition  these disputes may result in reduction in revenue  a loss on a particular project  or even a significant damages award against the company 
the loss of specialized key employees could affect performance and revenues 
there is a risk of the company s losing key employees having engineering and technical expertise to other employers 
for example  the utility solutions segment relies heavily on engineers with significant experience and reputation in the utility industry to furnish expert consulting services and support to customers 
there is a current trend of a shortage of these qualified engineers because of hiring competition from other companies in the industry 
loss of these employees to other employers could reduce the segment s ability to provide services and affect revenues negatively 
environmental or regulatory requirements could increase expenses and adversely affect profitability 
the company s operations and properties are subject to us and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  emission  discharge  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and the clean up of contaminated properties 
these regulations  and changes therein  could increase the cost of compliance 
failure to comply could result in the imposition of significant fines  suspension of production  alteration of product processes  cessation of operations or other actions  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  the company is currently involved as a responsible party in several on going investigations and remediations of contaminated properties  both company owned and off site 
future costs associated with these situations are difficult to quantify 
these and any future costs associated with environmental issues currently unknown could have a significant effect on the company s financial condition 
see item  business environmental matters for a discussion of these factors 
competition is broadly based and global in scope 
the company faces competition from a large number of manufacturers and distributors for nearly all of its products 
some of the company s competitors are larger  more diversified corporations  global in scope  with greater financial  marketing  production and research and development resources 
if the company cannot compete successfully against current or future competitors  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
