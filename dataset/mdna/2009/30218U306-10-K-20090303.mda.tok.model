h intangible and other assets reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets goodwill represents primarily the amount that arose from continental s emergence from bankruptcy reorganization in effective january   we adopted and began to account for this asset in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires testing of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment rather than amortizing them 
our goodwill is related to our contract flying segment 
we evaluate the carrying value of this asset each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
we perform an impairment review on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
our annual impairment test  which is performed as of june of each year  includes the acquisition  market multiple and income approaches to valuation 
if this review indicates that our goodwill will not be recoverable  the carrying value is reduced to the fair value 
during we determined our goodwill was fully impaired due to the restructuring of our agreement with continental and recorded a non cash charge of million 
airport operating rights  the rights to use certain take off and landing slots and gates  are amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the related airport facility lease  which approximates years  with no residual value 
during we sold the airport operating rights at net book value 
capitalized costs related to our senior convertible notes is amortized on a straight line basis through august  the first date at which we may be required to repurchase the notes  with no residual value 

table of contents i investments in other entities investments in unconsolidated companies are accounted for by the equity method of accounting when we have significant influence over the operation of the companies as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock abp 
we review our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be fully recoverable 
evidence of a loss in value that is other than temporary might include the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the equity investment  the near and longer term operating and financial prospects of the entity and our longer term intent of retaining the investment in the entity 
management s assessment as to whether any decline in value is other than temporary is based on our ability and intent to hold the investment and whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
if the fair value of the investment is determined to be less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded based on the excess of the carrying value over the best estimate of fair value of the investment 
j deferred credits our spare part and flight training credits are primarily derived from our purchase agreement with embraer 
all spare part credits are used to offset the purchase price of initial spare parts provisioning for our newly delivered aircraft 
similarly  the flight training credits are used to pay for the initial simulator rent costs for our pilots 
these credits are recorded in long term liabilities  with an offsetting entry to prepayments and other current assets or current accrued liabilities if we used more credits than the amount we are entitled to at year end 
the deferred credits are amortized as a reduction to our aircraft rent expense over the life of the associated aircraft lease 
amortization totaled million and million for and  respectively 
the prepayments and other current assets or current accrued liabilities are reduced as the credits are used or as the remaining firm order aircraft are delivered 
due to the transition in our business model  we wrote off million in deferred credits in k operating revenue passenger revenue 
prior to july   we were entitled to receive payment for each block hour that continental scheduled us to fly pursuant to the terms of the continental cpa 
payment was based on a formula designed to provide airlines with a target operating margin of before taking into account variations in certain costs and expenses that were generally within our control 
we had exposure for most labor costs and some maintenance and general administrative expenses if actual costs were higher than those budgeted in our block hour rates 
for the first six months of  we recognized revenues using block hour rates  pursuant to our agreement with continental reached in june under the amended continental cpa  certain costs are no longer reimbursable primarily fuel  rent and certain ground handling costs  and therefore such items are presented net in the accompanying consolidate results of operations from the periods july  forward 
in june  we reached an agreement with continental to amend the existing continental cpa 
under the amended continental cpa  which became effective july   we recognize revenue based on fixed contractual rates 
see note contract flying for further details regarding the continental cpa 
under the delta cpa  we received a base rate for each completed block hour and departure and were reimbursed for certain pass through costs 
we recorded the base rate and the reimbursements for pass through costs as passenger revenue 
effective september   we mutually agreed with delta to terminate this agreement 

table of contents effective september   we terminated our branded flying operations 
prior to september   tickets for branded flying were sold and processed internally  with amounts due settled either by cash payments up front or pursuant to the terms of our agreements with various credit card service vendors 
additionally  we accepted flight coupons to carry passengers on our aircraft from other air carriers  which were then processed internally and settled on a monthly basis through an airline clearing house  as appropriate  or pursuant to the terms of various industry or codeshare agreements  such as the delta prorate agreement 
we recognized passenger revenue when transportation was provided or when an unused ticket expired 
nonrefundable tickets expired on the date of the intended flight  unless the date was extended by notification from the customer in advance of the intended flight 
as of december   obligations related to our branded flying air traffic liability have been satisfied 
for the year ended december   the amount of passenger ticket sales not yet recognized as revenue is included in our consolidated balance sheets as air traffic liability 
amounts receivable from other air carriers under interline agreements were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we recognized million in revenue as a result of the cessation of operations due to the adjustments to our air traffic liability  frequent flier liability and certain termination payments 
our corporate aviation customers typically prepay flights based on estimated charges to be incurred 
such prepayments are held in escrow and recorded as restricted cash and deferred revenue until the flights have operated 
at that time we recognize the associated revenue and release the funds from escrow 
we are also required to collect certain taxes and fees from the passengers on behalf of government agencies and remit these back to the applicable agency on a periodic basis 
these taxes and fees include us federal transportation taxes  federal security charges  and airport passenger facility charges 
these items are collected from our customers at the time they purchase their tickets  but are not included in passenger revenue 
we record a liability upon collection from the customer and release the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency 
ground handling and other 
we recognize our non passenger revenue  ground handling and other revenues as services are provided

table of contents n aircraft facilities leases all of our aircraft are either leased or sub leased from continental 
the amended continental cpa changed the way we pay rent for aircraft covered under the continental cpa 
effective july   we no longer pay aircraft lease rent to continental for the aircraft covered under the amended cpa with continental 
lease payments to continental relating to the aircraft removed from the continental cpa are at reduced rates 
we also have airport and maintenance facility leases that are leased from airport authorities or other municipal authorities 
in order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease  we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset  as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
the assumptions used in our lease classification analyses are based on our interpretation of available market data and specific contract terms 
see note leases for further details 
o maintenance and repair costs maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased flight equipment  including the overhaul of aircraft components  are charged to operating expense as incurred  except for those maintenance costs covered by power by the hour agreements  which are expensed based on contractual terms

p income taxes deferred income taxes  which are provided under the liability method  are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws 
operating losses which are dependent on the generation of future taxable income are recorded as a deferred tax asset 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that future tax benefits will not be realized

q fair value measurements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements statement  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
we adopted the provisions of statement as of january  for our financial assets and liabilities 
the fasb deferred the effective date of statement for one year as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis until  which we do not expect to impact the company 
statement provides a consistent definition of fair value which focuses on exit price and prioritizes  within a measurement of fair value  the use of market based inputs over entity specific inputs 
the standard also establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
the three tiers of fair value input are defined below level inputs to the valuation methodology which are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs to the valuation methodology which are quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  and level inputs to the valuation methodology which are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 

table of contents as of december   we held cash equivalents and short term investments of ars that were required to be measured at fair value

if continental defaults on the payment obligations it has to us under the continental cpa or other agreements  then in addition to any other remedies we may have  we can offset the amount of the defaulted payments against the amounts we owe to continental under any agreements in an amount corresponding to its defaulted payments 
s recently issued accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb affirmed the consensus of fasb staff position apb fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  which applies to all convertible debt instruments that have a net settlement feature  which means that such convertible debt instruments  by their terms  may be settled either wholly or partially in cash upon conversion 
fsp apb requires issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled wholly or partially in cash upon conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner reflective of the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
fsp apb is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is not permitted and retroactive application to all periods presented is required 
the adoption of fsp apb will affect the historical accounting for our original convertible notes and our convertible secured notes due we are continuing to evaluate the impact of this standard to our results of operations and financial position however  we expect that the ultimate application of fsp apb will result in an increase in interest expense for the years presented 
in addition  the company is evaluating the impact this standard will have on our convertible secured notes due t reclassifications certain reclassifications have been made in prior years financial statements to conform to the current year presentation  including adjustments to common stock  additional paid in capital  and share amounts due to our reverse split reverse split of our common stock in in addition  million of operating revenue as of december  was reclassed to other operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations and a million increase in restricted cash was reclassed from net cash provided by operating activities to net cash used in investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  note contract flying as of december   we averaged over daily flights in our contract flying  offering passenger service to over scheduled destinations in north america  including mexico as well as the caribbean 
we generated billion of revenue of our total consolidated revenue in this segment 

table of contents continental capacity purchase and other agreements general 
a significant portion of our revenue and cash flows is attributable to the continental cpa 
under the continental cpa  airlines operates flights on behalf of continental as continental express 
continental controls and is responsible for scheduling  pricing and managing seat inventories and is entitled to all revenue associated with the operation of the aircraft 
we also have various other agreements with continental that govern our relationship 
under the continental cpa  all marketing related costs normally associated with operating an airline are borne by continental 
these costs include reservations and sales  commissions  advertising  revenue accounting  fare and tariff filings  and food and beverage service 
amended continental cpa 
prior to july   airlines was entitled to receive payment for each block hour that continental scheduled it to fly pursuant to the terms of the continental cpa 
payment was based on a formula designed to provide airlines with a target operating margin of before taking into account variations in certain costs and expenses that were generally within our control 
we had exposure for most labor costs and some maintenance and general administrative expenses if actual costs were higher than those budgeted in our block hour rates 
for the first six months of  we recognized revenues using block hour rates  pursuant to our agreement with continental reached in june at such time  we also reached an agreement with continental to amend the existing continental cpa 
the amended continental cpa  which became effective july   allows us to continue flying  at minimum  aircraft for continental for seven years while providing continental the right after one year to reduce the number of aircraft to a minimum of aircraft 
it should be noted going forward in our document  we will use the designation  the continental cpa  for matters that remained same between the original cpa and the amended continental cpa  where matters differed between the original cpa and the amended continental cpa  they will be specifically identified to the amended continental cpa 
the amended continental cpa significantly reduces continental s governance rights under the original cpa  including easing change of control limitations on expressjet  reducing restrictions on our flying into continental s hub airports  and removing the most favored nation clause  allowing us the option to fly for other carriers and to consider other strategic alternatives 
the amended continental cpa also removes continental s ability to terminate the agreement without cause 
the amended continental cpa provides payments to us at a pre determined rate based on block hours flown and reimburses us for various pass through expenses including passenger liability insurance  hull insurance  war risk insurance  landing fees and substantially all regional jet engine expenses under current long term third party contracts with no margin or mark up 
under the amended continental cpa  continental is responsible for the cost of providing fuel for all flights and for paying aircraft rent for all aircraft covered by the amended continental cpa and  therefore  these items are not included in our statements of operations for the three month period ended september  and thereafter 
the fixed block hour rates are considerably lower than the rates under the original agreement and will be subject to annual escalations tied to a consumer price index capped at at each anniversary date  july during  we returned as part of the amended continental cpa negotiations  aircraft  with continental bearing the expense related to the aircraft following their return 
we will continue to operate at least aircraft through july  beginning on july   continental can remove up to aircraft making the new minimum aircraft requirement under the agreement therefore  we will continue to focus on aggressively managing costs in response to the amended continental cpa and the economic difficulties facing the entire airline industry 

table of contents we also entered into a settlement agreement with continental to release the parties claims at the time of the agreement to amend the then existing capacity purchase agreement  relating to certain identified payments under such capacity purchase agreement  including disputes previously disclosed as possible matters for arbitration 
in september  we agreed with continental on the first amendment to the amended continental cpa in order to compensate us for our fixed costs  considered in the calculation of the pre determined block hour rates  that cannot be reduced as a result of the unanticipated reduction in aircraft utilization by continental s scheduling 
we also agreed that if continental  beginning in year two  increases its aircraft utilization above a predetermined threshold  then it may receive discounts on the agreed  pre determined block hour rates 
for the last six months of  we recognized an additional million in contract revenues as compensation for shortfalls in aircraft utilization 
in december  we agreed with continental on the first second amendment to the amended continental cpa in order to clarify certain issues related to our revenue recognition  the fuel efficiency program in place in connection with the amended continental cpa and depreciation related to the aircraft we operate for continental and excess inventory related thereto 
prior years settlement of the continental cpa 
airlines was entitled to receive payment for each block hour that continental scheduled it to fly 
payment was based on a formula designed to provide airlines with a target operating margin before taking into account variations in certain costs and expenses that were generally within our control 
we had exposure for most labor costs and some maintenance and general administrative expenses if actual costs were higher than those budgeted in our block hour rates 
prior years payment methodologies are described in the following paragraphs 
as part of the rate negotiations  we agreed to cap airlines prevailing margin at in an attempt to ensure the long term stability of the continental cpa 
airlines also began including previously unreconciled costs  as discussed above  within the margin band  although it was not reimbursed if these costs are higher and cause its prevailing margin to fall below the margin floor 
airlines remained entitled to receive incentive payments from continental if its rate of controllable cancellations was lower than its historical benchmark  but was no longer required to pay continental a penalty for controllable cancellations unless the rate rises above 
airlines continued to receive a small per passenger fee and incentive payments for certain on time departure and baggage handling performance 

table of contents the table below describes how variations between airlines actual costs and estimated costs  as determined in the block hour rates  were treated under the continental cpa from january  to june  fully reconciled costs reconciliation payment  including margin  to the full extent actual costs differ from estimated costs 
fuel and into plane expenses aircraft rent terminal facility rent on time bonuses and k company match under current plans taxes other than income taxes passenger liability insurance hull insurance war risk insurance landing fees ground handling services administrative services provided by continental third party security and screening expenses substantially all regional jet engine expenses under current long term third party contracts depreciation and amortization glycol  de icing  snow removal international navigational fees costs within the margin band if actual expenses in this category are sufficiently different from estimates used in the block hour rates so that the prevailing margin is less than or greater than  then a reconciliation payment is made by either continental or airlines to the other so that this prevailing margin will be or  as applicable 
if the prevailing margin is less than due to impact of certain costs  as described below  or if the prevailing margin is above due to other items  no reconciliation payments would be made from either continental or airlines 
maintenance  materials and repairs not included above passenger services other rental expenses other operating expenses under our fuel purchase agreement with continental  fuel and fuel tax expense are reconciled to the lower of the actual costs or the agreed upon caps of cents per gallon and cents per gallon  respectively 
if the fuel purchase agreement with continental were not in place  the fuel cost  including related taxes  would have been  and per gallon for the years ended december   and respectively 
depreciation is reconciled for assets and capital projects accounted for in the continental cpa or those approved by continental outside of the agreement 
the prevailing margin used to calculate the reconciliation payment does not take into account performance incentive payments  including payments from controllable cancellation performance  litigation costs above a historical benchmark and other costs that are not included in the block hour rates or covered by adjustments to them or are not reasonable and customary in the industry 
in  the fully reconciled costs and costs within the margin band under the continental cpa represented approximately and of operating costs associated with continental cpa flying  respectively  in addition to of costs related to the continental cpa which could not be included in either reimbursable grouping such as certain labor and arbitration costs 
in  the fully reconciled costs and costs within the margin band under the continental cpa represented approximately and of operating costs associated with continental cpa flying  respectively 
the remaining of operating costs in were incurred outside of the continental cpa in order to support our diversification strategies for the aircraft released from the continental cpa as well as the administrative operations we assumed from continental in 
table of contents some costs that were unreconciled under the continental cpa prior to now require airlines to make a reconciliation payment to continental if the differences cause the prevailing margin to be greater than 
however  if the differences cause the prevailing margin to be less than  they remain unreconciled 
these costs are wages and salaries  and benefits not included in the table above 
arbitration 
in  continental challenged our interpretation of the continental cpa and sought to impose rates for that we believed were inconsistent with the methodology established in the agreement 
we were unable to agree on the rates and  in accordance with the terms of the continental cpa  we submitted our dispute to binding arbitration 
the arbitration panel determined that the annual budgeted rates originally presented by airlines should be reduced in the aggregate by million or less than of our total continental cpa operating revenue  which included the target operating margin 
although we believe our original rates were appropriate  we were pleased with the panel s decision 
the scheduled block hour rates were finalized in october  and we recorded our passenger revenue under the continental cpa using the block hour rates determined by the panel for all of note restructuring and related special charges effective july   we entered into a new seven year capacity purchase agreement with continental by amending and restating the existing continental cpa 
the amended agreement is based on fixed block hour rates that are considerably lower than the rates under the original agreement  which was designed to achieve an approximate margin 
additionally  we suspended flying under our branded flying operations and terminated the delta cpa and the delta prorate in september in connection with these capacity reductions and the transition of aircraft back to continental  we incurred special charges of million related to aircraft  employee reductions and certain other charges 
special charges the following table sets forth the special charges recorded for the year ended december  and related to the capacity reductions noted above in thousands year ended december  wages and fringe lease return costs deferred credits contract termination costs unused facility costs other 
table of contents wages and fringe 
as a result of our restructuring we implemented a reduction in workforce and recorded million in severance and continuing medical coverage and other fringe benefits for employees accepting early retirement 
we do not expect additional charges related to the reduction in workforce to be significant 
lease return costs 
we incurred million in costs during to retrofit returned aircraft to comply with the return conditions specified in the subleases 
these costs included labor and materials to repair  paint  and modify the interiors to prelease conditions 
deferred credits 
we wrote off million in deferred credits in the credits were from the aircraft manufacturer to cover training and spare parts purchases and were being amortized against aircraft rent expense over the lives of the underlying aircraft leases 
due to the transition in our business model  we no longer are charged aircraft rent and accordingly wrote off the deferred credits 
contract termination costs 
during  we incurred million in early termination payments to sever contractual relationships that supported our branded flying operations 
we are currently in negotiation with other parties to settle early contract terminations so there may be additional contract termination charges in  however we do not expect the charges to be significant 
unused facility costs and other 
we recorded a charge of million in for the future rent obligations related to facility leases at locations that supported our suspended operations 
payments remaining on these lease obligations will continue through in addition  we incurred million in to redeploy certain general service equipment from our unused facilities to our other lines of business 
the above costs are reflected in the line special charges on our consolidated statements of operations 
as of december  our accruals for special charges we expect to pay in cash are as follows in thousands balance december  special charges payments adjustments balance december  wages and fringe leased return costs contract termination costs unused facility costs other payments related to the wages and fringe accrual and contract termination costs will be made in payments remaining on our lease obligations for unused facilities will continue through in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets sfas we record impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired  the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value 
as a result of our impairment test  we concluded the carrying values of certain of our long lived assets  primarily leasehold improvements in our at risk flying segment were no longer recoverable 
consequently  during  we recorded impairment charges of million to write these long lived assets down to their estimated fair values 
fair values were determined based on estimated future cash flows for branded flying which were considered nominal 
no portion of the impairment charge will result in future cash expenditures 
all other long lived assets for our other reportable segments were tested for impairment but were concluded to be recoverable with projected undiscounted cash flows 

table of contents goodwill of million represents an amount associated with continental s bankruptcy restructuring and was recorded on our books prior to expressjet s ipo from continental in in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we apply a fair value based impairment test to the net book value of goodwill on an annual basis and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis 
the analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two step process 
the first step is the estimation of fair value 
if step one indicates that impairment potentially exists  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
goodwill impairment exists when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than our carrying value 
goodwill is allocated to our contract flying reportable segment 
we estimated fair value based on a discounted projection of future cash flows  supported with market based valuation 
during  we determined goodwill was impaired and recorded a non cash charge of million 
the impairment charges for both long lived assets and goodwill total million 
these charges are reflected in the line impairment of fixed assets and goodwill on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  fuel 
under the amended continental cpa  continental is responsible for the cost of providing fuel for all flights and  therefore  effective july   fuel expense is no longer included in our statements of operations for aircraft flying within this arrangement 
upon the decision to suspend operations for airlines branded flying on july   we sold our fixed forward purchase contracts for periods subsequent to september   which resulted in a non operating gain of approximately million 
to date  we have received million in cash from world fuel services with the remaining million held in deposit for future fuel purchases within our corporate aviation division 
the funds held in deposit by world fuel services earn interest 
note segment reporting the following business discussion is based on the three reportable segments  contract flying  branded flying and aviation services  as they were structured during the year ended december  a significant portion of our operating expenses and infrastructure is integrated across segments eg  for maintenance  non airport facility rentals  outside services  general and administrative expenses in order to support our entire fleet of aircraft  therefore  we do not allocate these costs to the individual segments identified above  but evaluate them for our consolidated operation 
the presentation of our consolidated shared costs is consistent with the manner in which these expenses are reviewed by our chief operating decision makers 
consequently  the tables below present in thousands our operating revenues  including inter segment revenues  and segment profit losses generated per reportable segment for the years ended december  and we also included our reconciliation of the consolidated operating revenue to consolidated net loss before taxes and of our total assets as of december  and

note fair value measurements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements statement  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring it and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
we adopted the provisions of statement as of january  for our financial assets and liabilities 
however  the fasb deferred the effective date of statement for one year as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis until  which we do not expect to materially impact the company 
the new standard provides a consistent definition of fair value which focuses on exit price and prioritizes  within a measurement of fair value  the use of market based inputs over entity specific inputs 
the standard also establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
the three tiers of fair value input are defined below level inputs to the valuation methodology which are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs to the valuation methodology which are quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  and level inputs to the valuation methodology which are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 

table of contents in february  we invested in approximately million in ars which are classified as available for sale securities and reflected at fair value 
the fair value of our ars is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation model as of december  as of december   we continue to earn interest at an average rate of on all of our ars 
at the end of each quarter we record any changes in fair value related to these instruments that we deem to be temporary to accumulated other comprehensive income 
if we determine that any future decline in value was other than temporary  it would be recognized as a charge to earnings as appropriate 
our valuation model considers  among other items  the collateralization underlying the ars  the creditworthiness of our counterparties  the timing of expected future cash flows  and a discount rate which accounts for the liquidity issue associated with the current market conditions 
these securities were also compared  where possible  to other observable market data with similar characteristics  however  due to the contraction in the credit markets and other factors  the market for ars is currently trading at minimal volumes 
as we could not predict when the market would recover and needed to avail ourselves the flexibility to sell our ars in the next months  we evaluated and classified  in accordance with accounting guidance our ars as short term investments and recognized in the first quarter of an other than temporary impairment of million 
this impairment charge was recognized as impairment charges on investments in our consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we estimated the fair value of our ars investment to be million and recorded net unrealized gains or losses to other comprehensive income  accordingly 
our total net comprehensive loss for the year ended december  was million 
subsequent to year end  we monetized million of our ars for of the face value of the securities 
we continue to monitor the ars market and will aggressively pursue monetizing the assets at or near face value through additional market transactions and will also pursue litigation if necessary to recoup full value

we evaluated the net book value of the company s fixed assets as of june  and identified approximately a million difference between net book value and fair value 
the majority of the difference is being amortized over the remaining average life of the assets identified 
during fourth quarter  we evaluated and determined that the carrying value of our investment in wing was other than temporarily impaired due to continuing net losses through and the projections of growth were no longer as aggressive as anticipated when we purchased this entity 
therefore  we recognized an impairment charge of million comprised primarily of the inherent goodwill 
during the second quarter of  we impaired the remaining investment balance in wing due to continuing losses

in  we determined that fss had satisfied its obligation on the note and we reclassified it from other assets  net to investments in other entities on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we evaluated and determined that the carrying value of our investment in fss was other than temporarily impaired due to our decision to fully reserve for the value of fss s share of its s federal income tax attributes due to the uncertainty of their ultimate realizability

based on the principal amount of notes remaining outstanding on august   the pledged collateral for the notes totals approximately million in spare parts and million in spare engines 
we agreed that we will not as of any fiscal year end permit the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the notes divided by the fair market value of the pledged collateral to be greater than certain percentages

general provisions of applicable state law  however  may limit the ability of any subsidiary to pay dividends or make distributions to its parent in certain circumstances 
if we elect to use shares of common stock to repurchase any notes  the number of shares will be equal to the repurchase price divided by of the average closing sales price of our common stock for the five consecutive trading days ending on the third business day prior to the applicable repurchase date adjusted to take into account the occurrence of certain events that would require adjustment of the conversion rate 
in certain circumstances  the notes were convertible into our common stock  at a ratio of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per common share  however  following our reverse split the ratio is now  which is equivalent to a price of approximately per common share 
the ratio is subject to adjustments if certain events take place  and holders may convert only if the closing sale price per common share exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter

the regulation mandates a three year look back requiring holdings to evaluate its position related to section beginning in the results of the look back analysis indicated that holdings triggered section changes in ownership in april and in august the april change resulted in an after tax charge of million primarily related to interest on the timing of certain tax obligations 
due to the decrease in our market capitalization  the section change triggered in august resulted in our conclusion that it was more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize our deferred tax assets due to this limitation and therefore we recorded an increase of million to the valuation allowance 
we recorded the effects of this adjustment in as any impact to previously reported financial statements was not deemed to be material 
also during we recorded million in income tax expense to record a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets related to capital losses and  international and state tax net operating losses as it was concluded more likely than not that adequate income would not be generated to utilize these deferred tax assets based on their characterization and or carryforward period 

table of contents see the table below for expiration dates of our tax attribute loss carryforwards in millions december  statutory carryforward period expiration year s net operating carryforwards federal loss to federal credit no expiration n a state loss to to international loss to in conjunction with our initial public offering in april  the tax basis of our tangible and intangible assets was adjusted to fair value 
this adjustment to tax basis should result in additional tax deductions being available to us through in october  continental entered into a final settlement agreement with the irs that included periods during which we were included in its consolidated federal income tax return 
our taxable income was not adjusted  but the amount of net operating losses allocated to us was increased by approximately million 
in accordance with our tax agreement with continental  to the extent we generate taxable income sufficient to realize the additional tax deductions and tax attributes allocated to us  we are required to pay continental a percentage of the amount of tax savings actually realized  excluding the effect of any loss carrybacks 
we are required to pay continental of the first third of the anticipated tax benefit  of the second third and of the last third 
however  if the tax benefits are not realized by the end of  we will be obligated to pay continental of any benefit realized after that date 
since these payments are solely dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets  they are recorded as an obligation to continental within the deferred tax asset accounts  and the portion we may retain in the future is offset by a valuation allowance 
at the time of the initial public offering  the valuation allowance and the obligation to continental offset the step up in basis of assets in our long term deferred tax asset account 
there were no payments made to continental under the tax agreement during and we made approximately million and million of net payments to continental under the tax agreement related to the additional tax deductions during and  respectively 
because of the april section change in ownership  our ability to utilize some of the tax attributes flowing from continental has been limited 
our losses in and carryback to offset the tax shortfall  but result in an interest charge recorded in current tax expense and discussed above 
our august section ownership change limits our ability to realize the gross deferred tax assets recorded at december  federal and many state net operating loss carryovers are subject to substantial annual limitations over their remaining life  while our federal regular tax deductions for our tax amortizable intangible assets are limited for the five year period after this ownership change 
we are currently assessing the impact of this limitation including any amounts that may be owed from continental to the company 
if amounts are recoverable from continental  it may decrease the valuation allowance recorded as of december  our tax agreement increases our dependence on continental s financial condition 
if it is determined that any of the tax benefits related to the basis increase should not have been available at the time of utilization and  as a result  we are required to pay additional taxes  interest and penalties  then we could be adversely affected if continental were unable to indemnify us under the agreement 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements if a position is more likely than not of being sustained by a taxing authority 
we classify interest and penalties on tax deficiencies as charges to income tax expense 
for the year ended december  we recorded a net interest charge of million to income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations

earnings per share 
basic earnings per common share basic eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the company 
as discussed below under reverse stock split  our stock began trading on a split adjusted basis when the market opened on october  as required per sec staff accounting bulletin topic c  changes in capital structure  the computation of basic and diluted loss per share has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented in our consolidated statements of operations

as a result of our tender offer with respect to our original convertible notes due  we issued million shares reverse split adjusted of our common stock in payment for the million principal amount of the notes validly tendered and to settle accrued and unpaid interest that was due august  reverse stock split 
on october   at a special meeting of our stockholders  we received stockholder approval for a proposal to effect a one for ten reverse split of our common stock  par value per share 
the approved proposal also reduced the number of authorized shares of the company s common stock from  to  the reverse split became effective on october  the reverse split was part of our continuing efforts to return to trading on all new york stock exchange nyse group platforms 
in addition  the reverse split was a step to allow us to return to compliance with the continued listing standard of the nyse on january  as a result of the reverse split  each shares of our common stock was combined into and automatically became one share of our common stock which began trading on a split adjusted basis when the market opened on october   with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares 
the reverse split affected all shares of our common stock and stock options outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the reverse split 
the certificate of amendment did not change the par value of our common stock  which remains at per share 
each stockholder s percentage ownership in the company and proportional voting power remains unchanged after the reverse split except for minor changes and adjustments resulting from fractional shares 
the rights and privileges of stockholders were substantially unaffected by the reverse split

table of contents treasury stock 
in july  our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  the board authorized an additional million for this program 
purchases have been made from time to time in the open market  the timing of any share repurchases under the program depends on a variety of factors  including market conditions  and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
we account for our common stock repurchases using the cost method such that when shares are reissued  proceeds in excess of cost are charged to additional paid in capital and any deficiency is charged to accumulated earnings 
cost is determined using a weighted average price 
common stock acquired through the program is available for general corporate purposes 
as of december   we had a balance of million remaining within the program for additional purchases 
as discussed in note earnings loss per share  stockholders approved to effect a reverse split of our common stock in the following table details annual activity under the share repurchase program reverse split adjusted shares repurchased in thousands average cost per share excluding commissions shares forfeited under our stock based compensation plans are held as treasury stock  which can be used to issue new restricted stock and to satisfy any exercises of stock options 
note stock based compensation plans as of december   we had three stock based compensation plans the expressjet holdings  inc and stock incentive plans the incentive plans and the expressjet holdings  inc employee stock purchase plan the espp 
these incentive plans provide that we may grant awards in the form of stock options or restricted stock to our non employee directors  our employees or employees of our subsidiaries 
the incentive plan also provides that we may grant awards in the form of performance units  stock appreciation rights  or any other right  interest or option related to shares or other property  including cash 
the aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be issued under the incentive plans may not exceed million shares  subject to adjustments as provided in these incentive plans 
we have reserved million shares of our common stock for issuance under this plan 
options granted under these incentive plans have been awarded with exercise prices equaling the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant  vest over a four year period for employees or a six month period for non employee directors and expire seven years after the date of grant in the case of employees and ten years after the date of grant in the case of directors 
the fair value of holdings options granted during  and was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to make several assumptions 
the table below summarizes the weighted average of these assumptions for the year ended december   and risk free interest rate dividend yield expected market price volatility of our common stock expected life of options years 
table of contents the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant 
the dividend yield on our common stock is assumed to be zero since we do not pay dividends and have no current plans to pay them in the future 
the market price volatility of our common stock was based on historical volatility since april   the date of our initial public offering 
our methodology is consistent with prior period volatility assumptions 
the expected life of the options is based upon our anticipated expectations of exercise behavior since no options have been exercised since our initial public offering to provide relevant historical data

the gain is reflected in the line item wages  salaries and related costs in our consolidated statements of operations 
in december president bush signed the fair treatment for experienced pilots act hr into law 
this law increased the mandatory retirement age of commercial pilots from to as a result of this legislation we no longer are required to provide medical bridge coverage to our pilots between the ages of to and therefore  we have recorded a reduction in our liability and corresponding curtailment gain of million

the engines leased have greater interchangeability than the engines sold 
as a result  we have satisfied our engine obligations and are no longer obligated to purchase the three engines 
these leases are classified as operating leases  hence they are not reflected as assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we also have other contractual obligations of approximately billion under our power by the hour contracts with various service providers 
the power by the hour contracts dictate the method by which we pay a vendor based on our actual level of operations in exchange for vendor coverage on specific parts and equipment on our aircraft when those parts and equipment are in need of repair or replacement 
each contract varies in term and payment procedure 
the estimated amount of our future commitment is based on assumptions related to future level of operations and forecasted payment rates 
our level of operations  under the continental cpa  is determined by continental  which has exclusive scheduling authority over our fleet under the continental cpa 
the level of operations inherent in the estimate is based on continental s most recent operating plan for us  which can be altered at continental s sole discretion and included operations for the aircraft operating outside the continental cpa 
forecasted payment rates are based on actual rates as of december  and increased annually according to the particular inflation indices detailed in each contract 
contractual rate increases at actual time of occurrence may be different than the forecasted rates

in some cases  this indemnity extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties  but typically excludes liabilities caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct 
we cannot estimate the potential amount of future payments under these indemnities until events arise that would trigger a liability under the indemnities 
however  we expect to be covered by insurance for a material portion of these liabilities  subject to deductibles  policy terms and condition
