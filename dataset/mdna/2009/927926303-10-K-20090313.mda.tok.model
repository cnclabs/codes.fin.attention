likewise  there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire the necessary permits or authorizations on a timely basis to place the guadalupe de los reyes gold project into production 
delays in acquiring any permit  authorization or updates could increase the development cost of the paredones amarillos gold project or the guadalupe de los reyes gold project  or delay the start of production 
the most significant environmental permitting requirements  as they relate to the paredones amarillos and the guadalupe de los reyes gold projects are developing reports on environmental impacts  regulation and permitting of discharges to air  water and land  new source performance standards for specific air and water pollutant emitting sources  solid and hazardous waste management regulations  developing risk assessment reports  developing evacuation plans  and monitoring inventories of hazardous materials 
if the paredones amarillos or the guadalupe de los reyes gold projects are found to not be in compliance with any of these requirements  we could incur significant compliance costs  or might have to delay the start of production 
australia laws mineral projects in the northern territory are subject to northern territory laws and regulations regarding environmental matters and the discharge of hazardous wastes and materials 
as with all mining projects  the mt 
todd gold project would be expected to have a variety of environmental impacts should development proceed 
we are required under australian laws and regulations federal  state and territorial to acquire permits and other authorizations before the mt 
todd gold project can be developed and mined 
in australia  environmental legislation plays a significant role in the mining industry 
various environmental documents such as the eis over the mt 
todd gold project  covering studies on  inter alia  air  water  pollution  hazardous and toxic wastes  reclamation of mining area  etc 
must be prepared and submitted to the mining and petroleum authorizations and evaluation division of the department of primary industries  fisheries and mines of the northern territory government for approval 
the preparations of the eis and related documents and other relevant environmental licenses would involve incurrence of time and costs and there is no assurance that those approvals licenses can be obtained in a timely manner 
the northern territory government also has administrative discretion not to approve the eis documents or grant the required environmental licenses including any renewal or extensions of such documents 
we have entered into an agreement with the northern territory relating to environmental and rehabilitation issues 
we must also comply with aboriginal heritage legislation requirements which require heritage survey work to be undertaken prior to the commencement of mining operations 
all these conditions may result in the occurrence of significant production costs and delay the production activity of the mt 
todd gold project 
these conditions could frustrate investors seeking certainty in their investments  and as a result we may incur costs and time to manage any issues which may arise and that could possibly affect the overall mining activity of the mt 
todd gold project 
indonesia laws we are required under indonesian laws and regulations to acquire permits and other authorizations before our current indonesian mining project  the awak mas gold project  can be developed and mined 
in indonesia  environmental legislation plays a significant role in the mining industry 
various environmental documents such as the analysis of environmental impact amdal concerning the awak mas gold project  covering studies on  inter alia  air  water  land  pollution  hazardous and toxic wastes and reclamation of mining area  must be prepared and submitted to the ministry of environment for approval 
in addition  we are also required to submit periodical environmental reports to the relevant environmental government agencies pursuant to the amdal and other required environmental licenses eg license for tailing waste 
the preparation of amdal documents and other relevant environmental license documents involves incurrence of time and costs and there is no assurance that those approvals licenses can be obtained in a timely manner 
the indonesian government also has administrative discretion not to approve amdal documents or grant the required environmental licenses including any renewal or extensions of such documents 
all these conditions may delay the production activity of the awak mas gold project 
failure to meet all of the requirements with respect to the above environmental documents  licensing and report submissions could cause us to be subject to administrative and criminal sanctions as well as fines 
in extreme cases  the administrative sanctions can also be imposed in the form of revocation of our business license and the contract of work that we have with the indonesian government 
as well  from time to time the implementation of the regional autonomy law in indonesia can cause uncertainty as to the existence and applicability of national and regional regulations including in the environmental sector 
often regional regulations are in conflict with higher regulations that apply nationally 
as a result we may incur cost and time to manage any issues which may arise and that could possibly affect the overall mining activity of the awak mas gold project 
disposal of amayapampa gold project our receipt of future payments in connection with our disposal of the amayapampa gold project is subject to uncertainty 
in april  we announced the disposal of our wholly owned subsidiary vista gold antigua corp 
vista gold antigua to republic 
vista gold antigua indirectly held our interest in the amayapampa gold project in bolivia 
see part i financial information item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other disposal of amayapampa gold project 
under the terms of the transaction  republic has agreed to pay vista million in three payments of million 
the first of these payments is due and payable upon the start of commercial production as defined in the purchase and sale agreement  see exhibit at amayapampa followed by million payments on each of the first and second anniversaries of the start of commercial production 
in addition  republic has agreed to pay vista a net smelter return royalty on the gold produced by or on behalf of republic from the amayapampa gold project in varying percentages depending on the price of gold per ounce 
the amayapampa gold project is not currently in production and we cannot assure that it will ever become a producing mine or  if production is commenced at the mine  the timing and amounts for any such production 
further  having disposed of the amayapampa gold project  vista will have no control over the development of this project 
depending on whether and when production commences at amayapampa and levels of production achieved  receipt by of vista of the future payments contemplated by the purchase and sale agreement for the amayapampa gold project is subject to uncertainty 
finally a number of legal proceedings have been initiated in bolivia with respect to the ownership interests in the mining concessions comprising the amayapampa gold project 
although vista gold is not a party to these proceedings  if these challenges are successful  then vista gold may lose its royalty and payment stream described above 
leverage as a result of our outstanding convertible notes may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
on march   we announced the closing of a private placement in which we issued million in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the notes are convertible into common shares of vista gold at the option of the holder at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  including if our common shares are trading on the nyse amex at less than on march   or we issue common shares  or securities convertible into common shares  at a price of less than during the term of the notes  subject to a minimum conversion price of 
pursuant to the terms of the notes  on march   the conversion price of the notes was automatically adjusted from per share to per share 
as a result of the adjustment  million common shares are issuable upon conversion of the notes 
prior to the adjustment million common shares were issuable upon the conversion of the notes 
upon conversion of the notes  existing shareholders will suffer immediate dilution in their capital interest in vista gold 
further  the market price of our common shares could decline as a result of the conversion of the notes and the sale into the market of the common shares underlying the notes 
these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common shares 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum calculated and payable semi annually in arrears and will mature on march  our obligations under the notes are guaranteed by our mexican subsidiary  minera paredones amarillos sa de sa  and the guarantee is secured by the personal property and real property associated with the paredones amarillos gold project 
our level and the terms of our indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations  including  without limitation that it will require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations  if any  to the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available to us for operations and any future business opportunities  could increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  as well as to competitive pressure  and depending on the levels of our outstanding debt  could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate and other purposes 
our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future ability to generate funds  including through operating cash flows  which will be subject to the potential development of certain of our properties into producing mines  metal prices  prevailing economic conditions  industry cycles and financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we cannot raise sufficient funds or our cash flows were to prove inadequate to meet our debt service and other obligations in the future  we may be required  among other things to obtain additional financing in the debt or equity markets  to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  or to sell selected assets 
we cannot assure you that such measures will be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operation  and additional financings  borrowings or refinancings  or proceeds of asset sales are not available to us  we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet our obligations  including payments on the notes 
see recent market events and conditions and general economic conditions 
we face intense competition in the mining industry 
the mining industry is intensely competitive in all of its phases 
as a result of this competition  some of which is with large established mining companies with substantial capabilities and with greater financial and technical resources than ours  we may be unable to acquire additional attractive mining claims or financing on terms we consider acceptable 
we also compete with other mining companies in the recruitment and retention of qualified managerial and technical employees 
if we are unable to successfully compete for qualified employees  our exploration and development programs may be slowed down or suspended 
we compete with other gold companies for capital 
if we are unable to raise sufficient capital  our exploration and development programs may be jeopardized or we may not be able to acquire  develop or operate gold projects 
we may be unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms 
the exploration and development of our properties  specifically the construction of mining facilities and commencement of mining operations  require substantial additional financing 
significant capital investment is required to achieve commercial production from each of our properties 
we will have to raise additional funds from external sources in order to maintain and advance our existing property positions and to acquire new gold projects 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or on acceptable terms and  if additional financing is not available  we may have to substantially reduce or cease our operations 
some of our directors may have conflicts of interest as a result of their involvement with other natural resource companies 
some of our directors are directors or officers of other natural resource or mining related companies

durand eppler is director of allied nevada gold corp 
and augusta resource corporation  and a director and non executive chairman of nemi northern energy mining inc tracy stevenson is the non executive chairman of quaterra resources inc these associations may give rise to conflicts of interest from time to time 
in the event that any such conflict of interest arises  a director who has such a conflict is required to disclose the conflict at a meeting of the directors of the company in question and to abstain from voting for or against approval of any matter in which such director may have a conflict 
in appropriate cases  the company in question will establish a special committee of independent directors to review a matter in which several directors  or management  may have a conflict 
in accordance with the laws of the yukon territory  the directors of all yukon territory companies are required to act honestly  in good faith and in the best interests of a company for which they serve as a director 
there may be challenges to our title in our mineral properties 
there may be challenges to title to the mineral properties in which we hold a material interest 
if there are title defects with respect to any of our properties  we might be required to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property 
also  in any such case  the investigation and resolution of title issues would divert management s time from ongoing exploration and development programs 
our property interests in mexico and indonesia are subject to risks from political and economic instability in those countries 
we have property interests in mexico and indonesia which may be affected by risks associated with political or economic instability in those countries 
the risks include  but are not limited to military repression  extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates  labor instability or militancy  mineral title irregularities and high rates of inflation 
in addition  changes in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in mexico or indonesia may adversely affect our business 
we may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation with respect to restrictions on production  price controls  export controls  income taxes  expropriation of property  maintenance of claims  environmental legislation  land use  land claims of local people  water use and mine safety 
the effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted 
our financial position and results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency values 
because we have mining exploration and evaluation operations in north and south america and in australia and indonesia  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuations  which may materially affect our financial position and results 
we do not engage in currency hedging to offset any risk of currency fluctuations 
we measure and report our financial results in us dollars 
we have mining projects in mexico  australia and indonesia  and we are looking for other projects elsewhere in the world 
economic conditions and monetary policies in these countries can result in severe currency fluctuations 
currently all our material transactions in mexico  australia and indonesia are denominated in us dollars 
however  if we were to begin commercial operations in any of these or other countries  it is possible that material transactions incurred in the local currency  such as engagement of local contractors for major projects  will be settled at a us dollar value that is different from the us dollar value of the transaction at the time it was incurred 
this could have the effect of undermining profits from operations in that country 
future sales of our common shares in the public or private markets could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares and our ability to raise funds in new share offerings 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common shares or securities exchangeable  convertible or exercisable for common shares in the public or private markets  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity related securities 
in march  we announced the closing of a private placement in which we issued million in aggregate principal amount the notes 
see leverage as a result of our outstanding convertible notes may harm our financial condition and results of operations above 
the notes are convertible into common shares at the option of the holder at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  including if our common shares are trading on the nyse amex at less than on march   or we issue common shares  or securities into common shares  at a price of less than during the term of the notes  subject to a minimum conversion price of 
pursuant to the terms of the notes  on march   the conversion price of the notes was automatically adjusted from per share to per share 
as a result of the adjustment  million common shares are issuable upon conversion of the notes 
prior to the adjustment million common shares were issuable upon the conversion of the notes 
shareholders would suffer dilution upon the conversion of the notes into our common shares 
for example  if all million of outstanding notes were converted at the minimum conversion price of  this would result in the issuance of an additional  common shares  or of our issued and outstanding common shares on march   upon conversion of the notes 
no prediction can be made as to the effect  if any  that future sales of common shares or securities exchangeable  convertible or exercisable for common shares or the availability of common shares for future sale  will have on the trading price of our common shares 
it may be difficult to enforce judgments or bring actions outside the united states against us and certain of our directors and officers 
vista gold is a canadian corporation and certain of its directors and officers are neither citizens nor residents of the united states 
a substantial part of the assets of several of these persons  and of vista gold  are located outside the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult or impossible for an investor to enforce in courts outside the united states judgments obtained in united states courts based upon the civil liability provisions of united states federal securities laws against these persons and vista gold  or to bring in courts outside the united states an original action to enforce liabilities based upon united states federal securities laws against these persons and vista gold 
recent market events and conditions in and into  the us credit markets began to experience serious disruption due to a deterioration in residential property values  defaults and delinquencies in the residential mortgage market particularly  sub prime and non prime mortgages and a decline in the credit quality of mortgage backed securities 
these problems led to a slow down in residential housing market transactions  declining housing prices  delinquencies in non mortgage consumer credit and a general decline in consumer confidence 
these conditions continued and worsened in  causing a loss of confidence in the broader us and global credit and financial markets and resulting in the collapse of  and government intervention in  major banks  financial institutions and insurers and creating a climate of greater volatility  less liquidity  widening of credit spreads  a lack of price transparency  increased credit losses and tighter credit conditions 
notwithstanding various actions by the us and foreign governments  concerns about the general condition of the capital markets  financial instruments  banks  investment banks  insurers and other financial institutions caused the broader credit markets to further deteriorate and stock markets to decline substantially 
in addition  general economic indicators have deteriorated  including declining consumer sentiment  increased unemployment and declining economic growth and uncertainty about corporate earnings 
these unprecedented disruptions in the current credit and financial markets have had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies 
these disruptions could  among other things  make it more difficult for vista gold to obtain  or increase its cost of obtaining  capital and financing for its operations 
vista gold s access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to it or at all 
general economic conditions the recent unprecedented events in global financial markets have had a profound impact on the global economy 
many industries  including the gold mining industry  are impacted by these market conditions 
some of the key impacts of the current financial market turmoil include contraction in credit markets resulting in a widening of credit risk  devaluations and high volatility in global equity  commodity  foreign exchange and precious metal markets  and a lack of market liquidity 
a continued or worsened slowdown in the financial markets or other economic conditions  including but not limited to  consumer spending  employment rates  business conditions  inflation  fuel and energy costs  consumer debt levels  lack of available credit  the state of the financial markets  interest rates  and tax rates may adversely affect vista gold s growth and profitability 
specifically the global credit liquidity crisis could impact the cost and availability of financing and our overall liquidity  the volatility of gold prices may impact our revenues  profits and cash flow  volatile energy prices  commodity and consumables prices and currency exchange rates impact potential production costs  and the devaluation and volatility of global stock markets impacts the valuation of our equity securities these factors could have a material adverse effect on vista gold s financial condition and results of operations

us investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves 
inferred mineral resources we advise us investors that while this term is recognized by canadian regulations  the sec does not recognize it 
inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence  and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility 
it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category 
under canadian rules  estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of a feasibility study or prefeasibility study  except in rare cases 
the sec normally only permits an issuer to report mineralization that does not constitute reserves only as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures 
us investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally minable

to acquire the project  we paid cash of cdn million and issued  equity units comprised of one common share and one purchase warrant to purchase one common share to viceroy  and on august   we paid viceroy the remaining cdn million due pursuant to the acquisition contract see also consolidated financial statements note 
the paredones amarillos gold project has been a significant exploration target since the s 
in  echo bay mines ltd 
ebm completed a final feasibility study for an open pit mine on the project 
as a result of the subsequent decline in gold prices  start up was postponed 
ebm holds a net profits interest on certain concessions of the project  subject to a cap of million 
additionally  minera tepmin  sa de sa  holds a net smelter returns royalty on two concessions 
the project holds environmental authorizations for the purpose of the following project development including access road  power line  telephone communications  and infrastructure to supply water  construction and operation of a tailings dam  disposal of tailings  construction of a mill  and installation of three pumping stations 
infrastructure and access the project site is currently accessible by government maintained dirt roads from the north and the west 
the project site is currently accessible on existing public roads paved highway to within miles of the project on the north then by government maintained dirt roads from the north 
there is also a government maintained dirt road from the west 
the main access will be from the north 
we plan to widen and improve approximately six miles of existing roads from the north and to construct approximately five miles of new road immediately north of the project 
at the present time  the project area is undeveloped with only several sheds used for drill sample storage and the drill access roads constructed during the exploration phase 
we maintain an office in the city of la paz 
high voltage electrical power will be available from an existing sub station located approximately miles north of the project area 
we intend to construct a new power line from the sub station to the project 
the power line design has been completed and the right of way agreements are in place 
we intend to use desalinated sea water from the pacific coast which is about miles to the west 
the length of the pipeline to transport desalinated sea water to the project is dependent on the ultimate route chosen  however miles was used in the feasibility study 
annual water consumption is estimated to be million gallons 
geology general geology consists of diorite roof pendants intruded by a granodiorite batholith with local low and high angle fault zones 
a north east striking  south east dipping low angle silicified fault zone cataclasite is the main host of gold mineralization at paredones amarillos 
movement along this structure has been characterized as reverse  resulting from compression 
secondary  high angle faulting is thought to control the higher grade mineralization at the project 
the known gold mineralized material occupies an inverted u shaped block with an approximate strike length of  feet east west  a width of approximately  feet north south  and a thickness of approximately feet 
the apex of the u is near the center of the proposed pit with the legs forming the east and west pit lobes

steven ristorcelli  p 
geo  an independent qualified person as defined by ni  and is part of the feasibility study 
the estimate was prepared using industry standard software and estimation methodologies 
of the holes in the data base  holes containing  samples were used in the resource estimate 
mr 
ristorcelli reviewed available information necessary for the preparation of the resource estimate  including sampling  analytical  drilling and geologic 
following a review of the available documentation pertaining to the sampling programs  the data was deemed sufficiently accurate to use for estimation 
however  mr 
ristorcelli noted that some of the early program s quality assurance and quality control procedures were poorly documented and that an apparent bias may exist between some of the assay values and the check assay values of the same samples 
as the original samples were not preserved and cannot be re assayed  mr 
ristorcelli has recommended a to hole drill program to confirm the validity of the model that relied on those assays whose check assay bias is unresolved 
mr 
ristorcelli undertook multiple checks to assess the validity of the model and classified the mineral resources into measured  indicated and inferred categories to be in compliance with the ni requirement of following cim standards on mineral resources and reserves  definitions and guidelines  issued in and modified with adoption of the cim definition standards for mineral resources and mineral reserves in under sec industry guide guidelines  mineralized material at a cut off grade of gold ounces per ton totals  tons grading gold ounces per ton 
under ni  using a cutoff grade of gold ounces per ton  measured mineral resources are estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton  indicated mineral resources are estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton and inferred mineral resources are estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton 
cautionary note to us investors mineral resources are not mineral reserves and there is no assurance that any mineral resources will ultimately be reclassified as proven or probable reserves 
mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability 
us investors should read the cautionary note to us investors regarding reserve and resource estimates above concerning the difference between resources and reserves 
silver occurs in the deposit  but due to the lack of quality assurance and quality control data for the silver assays  a ni compliant resource estimate has not been prepared 
metallurgical testing indicates that silver recoveries are variable  but silver production is not included in the study 
it cannot be assumed that any silver will be produced from the project 
the metallurgical recovery is estimated to be for gold 
the mineral reserve estimates prepared and reported by mine development associates  under the supervision of mr 
dyer  at a gold price of per ounce of gold and cut off grade of gold ounces per ton are summarized in the following table 
reserves estimated at paredones amarillos reserve classification short tons x average gold grade ounces ton proven  probable  proven probable  cautionary note to us investors concerning estimates of proven and probable reserves the estimates of mineral reserves shown in this table have been prepared in accordance with ni the definitions of proven and probable reserves used in ni differ from the definitions in sec industry guide accordingly  vista gold s disclosure of mineral reserves herein may not be comparable to information from us companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the sec 
us investors should read the cautionary note to us investors regarding reserve and resource estimates above 
as of january   the rolling three year average gold price was  which is slightly higher than the gold price used by mine development associates for the mineral reserves reported in the table above 
therefore  under sec industry guide requirements  we feel the mineral reserves listed above are conservative 
however  should we not be able to obtain the required governmental permits to mine the property  then the project would not have mineral reserves under either or sec industry guide the proposed pit is oriented approximately east west and would have two distinct lobes 
we plan to extract ore from the mine using conventional open pit mining equipment and techniques 
a ton truck and loader fleet has been selected and we would be the owner and operator of the fleet 
the higher grade west lobe would be mined first and a significant portion of the waste rock from the east lobe would be used to backfill the west lobe of the pit 
concurrent reclamation of two waste dumps would be completed during the latter years of the operation 
estimated life of mine average cash production costs are projected to be per ounce  with lower costs of per ounce projected during the first five years of production 
operating costs used diesel prices effective as of may and energy prices effective as of the first quarter pre production capital costs  including contingency  owner s costs and working capital  are estimated to be million or per ounce of gold produced 
total capital costs including replacement and reclamation over the life of the project are estimated to be per ounce of gold produced 
we intend to process the ore in a conventional crushing and grinding circuit consisting of a primary gyratory crusher followed by a semi autogenous grinding mill and two ball mills with an expected mill ore throughput rate of approximately  tons per day 
the crushing and grinding equipment was acquired from the colomac mine and is presently in edmonton  canada  waiting shipment to arizona for repairs and reconditioning 
the cost of this equipment was approximately million  with funds provided from our private placement of the notes  completed in march  for aggregate proceeds of approximately million 
the proposed flow sheet indicates that following grinding  the slurried ore will be sized by cyclones and then leached in tanks prior to gold recovery using a kemix carbon in pulp circuit 
gold will be stripped from the carbon and precipitated in an electrowinning cell prior to refining into dor bars 
the tailings will be detoxified using ferrous sulfate  paste thickened and deposited in a lined tailings impoundment facility on site 
due to the scarcity of surface water and political sensitivities regarding the use of groundwater  we have elected to construct and operate a desalination plant on the pacific coast 
water would be pumped approximately miles to the site 
annual water consumption is estimated to be approximately million gallons 
we expect that energy for the project will be supplied by the comisi n federal de electr cidad from an existing sub station located approximately miles north of the project 
it is anticipated that diesel fuel for the project will be provided in bulk quantities by petroleos de mexico 
fuel prices in mexico are subsidized and have not experienced the volatility seen in other locations 
the project is remotely located and is not expected to directly affect any local inhabitants 
our planned access road improvements will benefit the villages of valle perdido and el rosario 
we are currently working with the local education and health care authorities and have become a social partner with the elementary school in el rosario 
we are unaware of any social issues related to the development of the project 
the base case economic analysis used a gold price profile with a gold price of per ounce in the first three years of production  decreasing to per ounce for the remainder 
alternative sensitivity analyses were completed at gold prices of  and per ounce 
the economic analyses were conducted on equity basis with no consideration of debt or leasing 
estimated before and after tax economic results  showing the internal rate of return irr and net present value at a discount rate npv  cumulative cash flow and sensitivity of the base case to changes in gold prices are presented in the following tables

we expect to complete financing arrangements and begin construction as soon as the remaining permits are in hand 
as noted below  we have already purchased the major mill equipment with funds raised in our march private placement of the notes 
equipment purchase on january   we entered into a formal agreement with am king industries  inc am king and del norte company ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of am king  to purchase gold processing equipment to be used at the paredones amarillos gold project 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  of which approximately million was paid on signing of the asset sale agreement see exhibit hereto 
the remaining million was paid in february and march the purchase price included the cost of relocating the equipment to edmonton  alberta  canada 
from this point  we will arrange for reconditioning and transportation of the equipment to the project site 
the equipment includes a  ton per day semi autogenous sag grinding mill  two ball mills  gyratory crusher and a shorthead cone crusher  along with other related components  spare parts and other process plant equipment 
land purchases on december   we completed a transaction to purchase the land needed for a desalination plant for the paredones amarillos gold project 
the land is located on the pacific coast  approximately miles southwest of the project 
the four acre parcel of land is zoned for industrial use and the change of land use permit has been received from the municipality of la paz for the installation of the desalination plant 
on december   we entered into an agreement to purchase approximately  acres of land at paredones amarillos for the mill site and other infrastructure 
permitting status the paredones amarillos gold project is located in a special use area within the buffer zone of the sierra laguna biosphere reserve 
the special use area is located adjacent to the northern limit of the buffer zone and has unimpeded access from the north 
as previously reported  earlier in we announced that we received correspondence from the local la paz office of the semarnat which indicated that staff in that office are of the opinion that the cusf approved by semarnat in in relation to the paredones amarillos gold project is no longer valid 
this permit is necessary for the development of the project to proceed 
our mexican advisors and counsel in mexico have advised us that they believe that the permit remains valid 
however  our legal counsel advised us that a new change of land use permit application would be the most expeditious way to obtain the necessary approvals 
throughout  we have been involved in a steady dialogue with government officials in baja california sur and in mexico city 
on august   we filed a request for a top for the use of the federal ground in the project area for the life of the project 
as announced in press releases dated september and july   we indicated that we had decided to apply for a cusf 
in a november   press release  we indicated we were in final negotiations to purchase the land required for the process plant and tailings impoundment facility and had presented an application for a top for the use of the federal land which overlies the deposit 
the land purchase and top are necessary pre requisites for the cusf application 
on december   we reached agreement to purchase approximately  acres of land for the mill site and other infrastructure 
by the end of  we had not received the top 
communications that our advisors have had with the office of the general director of mines in the ministry of economy the department responsible for awarding the top indicate that the approval process is proceeding normally  but at a slower pace than expected 
we have the necessary environmental permit and completed the other prerequisite studies for the submittal of the cusf permit application and plan to file that permit application as soon as the top is received 
additional information is contained in our press releases dated april  may  may  july  september and november  and january  mt

vista australia entered into agreements with ferrier hodgson  the deed administrators for pegasus gold australia pty ltd 
pegasus  the government of the northern territory of australia and the jawoyn association aboriginal corporation jaac and other parties named therein  subject to regulatory approvals  to purchase a interest in the mt 
todd gold mine also known as the yimuyn manjerr gold mine in the northern territory  australia 
under these agreements  we are guarantor of the obligations of our subsidiary vista australia 
as part of the agreements  we agreed to pay pegasus  au million  and receive a transfer of the mineral leases and certain mine assets  and pay the northern territory s costs of management and operation of the mt 
todd site up to a maximum of approximately au  approximately  during the first year of the term initial term is five years  subject to extensions  and assume site management and pay management and operation costs in following years 
additionally  we agreed to issue common shares with a value of cdn million amounting to  common shares to the jaac as consideration for the jaac entering into the agreement and for rent for the use of the surface overlying the mineral leases until a decision is reached to begin production 
other agreement terms provide that we will undertake a technical and economic review of the mine and possibly form one or more joint ventures with the jaac 
in june  the transactions contemplated under the agreements were completed and effective  with funds held in escrow released to the ultimate vendors and the common shares issued to the jaac 
in august and september  we obtained several new exploration licenses  located generally to the north of and contiguous to the mt

mt 
todd was an operating mine in the late s 
although most of the processing equipment and facilities were removed from the site  basic infrastructure items are still in place  including access control point  small shop and office  mill building  and various concrete slabs and floors 
the batman pit is partially filled with water that has been pumped from the containment pond downstream of the waste dumps 
we will have to dewater the pit and treat the water for discharge prior to the start of operations 
the mt 
todd site was not reclaimed when the mine closed and as a result  the dumps and heap leach pad require ongoing care and maintenance 
vista australia provides that care and maintenance  but is not responsible for the environmental liability resulting from previous operations until we take the decision to re open the mine and have received the appropriate permits 
we began installing a water treatment plant in late and plan to complete the installation late in the first quarter of the treated water will initially be stored in the existing tailings impoundment facility  but we expect to receive the authorization to allow continual discharge as necessary 
the cost of this treatment system is estimated at approximately  of which approximately  was spent in  leaving approximately  that vista gold plans on expending in a medium voltage power line supplies the site with electrical power 
the mt 
todd gold project generated its own power using natural gas 
the natural gas pipeline is still in place 
the project has its own fresh water reservoir which is expected to supply all of the project s water needs 
geology the mt 
todd gold project is located approximately miles northwest of katherine  northern territory  australia 
the mt 
todd gold project is situated within the southeastern portion of the early proterozoic pine creek geosyncline 
the batman deposit geology consists of a sequence of hornfelsed interbedded greywackes and shales with minor thin beds of felsic tuff 
bedding consistently strikes at o  dipping o to o to the southwest 
northerly trending sheeted quartz sulfide veins and joints striking at o to o and dipping o to the east are the major controls for mineralization in the batman deposit 
the veins are to inches in thickness with an average thickness of around inches and occur in sheets with up to six veins per horizontal foot 
these sheeted veins are the main source of gold mineralization in the batman deposit 
in general  the batman deposit is  to  feet in length by  to  feet in true width and  to  feet in known down dip extension the deposit is open along strike and at depth 
based on a review of project files  our management believes that approximately million short tons grading gold ounces per ton and containing  ounces of gold were extracted between and the termination of mining in processing was by a combination of heap leach production from oxide ore and cyanidation of sulfide ore 
the remaining mineralization consists of sulfide mineralization lying below and along strike of the existing open pit 
a third party ni technical study was completed for vista gold on the batman deposit on june   by gustavson associates  llc gustavson of boulder  colorado  under the direction of mr 
john rozelle  an independent qualified person  utilizing standard industry software and resource estimation methodology 
the study is titled report ni technical report on the mt 
todd gold project  northern teritory sic  australia and is dated june  it is available on sedar 
the report includes the results of  assay intervals from drill holes core  reserve circulation and rotary drill holes done by bhp resources pty ltd  zapopan nl and pegasus with assaying by australia assay laboratories in pine creek and alice springs  classic comlabs in darwin and pegasus onsite lab 
pegasus mined part of the batman deposit from to  and a joint venture comprising multiplex resources pty ltd 
and general gold resources ltd 
mined the deposit from to the deposit has a drill hole spacing that varies from feet by feet to feet by feet and generally averages feet by feet 
all assaying was fire assay on gram charges 
it is the opinion of gustavson that quality control and quality assurance methods employed by the various companies working at mt 
todd were standard at the time of the work  and the work including quality control and quality assurance methods has been audited several times by independent consultants 
based on the report  under sec industry guide guidelines  mineralized material for the batman deposit  above a cut off grade of gold ounces per ton  was estimated to be  tons at a grade of gold ounces per ton 
at the same cut off grade  under the canadian institute of mining  metallurgy and petroleum in the cim definition standards  measured resources are  tons grading gold ounces per ton  indicated resources are  tons grading gold ounces per ton and inferred resources are  tons grading gold ounces per ton

an ni preliminary assessment was prepared for vista gold  by gustavson under the direction of john w 
rozelle  pg  an independent qualified person 
the study is titled preliminary economic assessment  mt 
todd gold project  northern territory  australia and is dated december  it was posted on sedar on january  in undertaking the preliminary assessment  gustavson considered the economic and technical parameters associated with development of the mineralized material by open pit mining 
the study included a conceptual process flowsheet developed by resource development inc of wheat ridge  colorado  which is based on preliminary testwork and includes a flotation circuit to recover a bulk sulfide concentrate  and further flotation to separate a copper sulfide concentrate that would contain about one half of the gold and which would be shipped to a smelter 
a pyrite concentrate containing about one half of the gold would also be produced and this concentrate would be cyanide leached to recover the gold 
the cyanide in the sulfide residue would be neutralized  following which the residue would be filtered to dry it  and then placed on a lined pad 
mwh australia pty ltd mwh designed conceptual tailing disposal facilities  including utilizing the existing tailing facility  and estimated capital costs for these facilities 
mwh also completed a closure study and cost estimate for closing the mine and facilities following resumption of production 
in the preliminary assessment  gustavson assumed a  ton per day million tons per year ore production rate  resulting in a ten year operating life 
overall gold recovery was estimated at and copper recovery at 
the cost estimates used in the preparation of a preliminary assessment are generally accepted as being within plus or minus of what might be incurred in actual construction and operations 
the costs in the mt 
todd preliminary assessment are within this level of confidence 
startup capital is estimated by gustavson at million 
mining costs are estimated at per tonne per ton of material mined  processing costs are estimated at per tonne per ton of ore processed and general and administrative costs are estimated at per tonne per ton processed 
based on these preliminary numbers  a review of the project economics indicates that the project continues to look favorable 
however  the study is based on mineralized material mineral resources under canadian guidelines and not mineral reserves 
mineralized material mineral resources under canadian guidelines that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability 
a determination of mineral reserves is necessary to demonstrate economic viability of the batman deposit 
additionally  in  we applied for exploration rights to tenements totaling about  acres adjoining the mining tenements  which were granted in  at which time we began to compile data from previous exploration companies in order to assess the exploration potential 
an infill core drilling program consisting of holes totaling  feet of drilling was completed in june to attempt to increase the mineralized material mineral resources under canadian guidelines in areas where the drill spacing is too wide to have confidence in the presence and grade of mineralized material within the planned pit  to expand the amount of mineralized material if possible  and to provide fresh samples for metallurgical testing 
by the end of  all gold assays had been received  with some check assays and base metals assays pending 
in early  we commissioned a new study to update estimates of mineralized material that would also include base metal content 
in late february  we announced an ni updated estimate for vista gold of mineralized material mineral resources under canadian guidelines by tetra tech of golden  colorado

the feasibility phase usually lasts one year  but may be negotiated for up to one year extensions 
following the feasibility phase  with government approvals  there would be a construction phase lasting usually three years 
the operating period follows the construction phase  lasting usually to years 
in late  we applied for a suspension of the feasibility period for one year 
we also applied for a reduction in area  as required  to eliminate the areas where we believe there is low potential to discover economic mineralization 
infrastructure and access the project is accessible by existing secondary paved and gravel public roads 
the access roads will require improvements in order to support the loads associated with the construction of the project 
at the present time  the project area is undeveloped with only a small office camp complex and several sheds used for drill sample storage and the drill access roads constructed during the exploration phase 
electrical power is presently supplied by diesel generator 
project power requirements may be supplied by diesel generated power or with commercial power from palopa 
if the latter is chosen  approximately miles of new power line construction will be required 
the project is located at the headwaters of a significant river system 
we believe that a small water reservoir can be constructed to provide water for the project 
geology the awak mas property is situated on the southern side of the central sulawesi metamorphic belt within a mile long  north northeast trending fault bounded block of basement metamorphic rocks and younger sediments 
the property covers approximately  acres 
the western margin of this block is represented by an easterly dipping thrust  whereas the eastern margin is defined by a major basement structure 
imbricate faulting has complicated the internal morphology of the block 
the property is dominated by the late cretaceous latimojong formation  consisting of phyllites  slates  basic to intermediate volcanics  limestone and schist representing a platform and or fore arc trough flysch sequence 
the latimojong formation overlies basement metamorphic rocks dominated by phyllites and slates 
both sequences have been intruded by late stage plugs and stocks of diorite  monzonite and syenite 
to the east of the metamorphic block  basic intermediate intrusives  pyroclastics and volcanogenic sediments comprising the mesozoic lamasi ophiolite complex appear to have been obducted into a position effectively overlying the younger flyschoid sequence and basement metamorphics during continental accretion 
gold mineralization is distinctly mesothermal in character  atypical of the more ubiquitous low temperature or epithermal precious metal mineralization within many island arc environments in indonesia 
gold is associated with sulphur poor  sodic rich fluids introduced at a relatively late stage in the tectonic history 
albite pyrite silica carbonate alteration  which accompanies gold deposition  clearly overprints the ductile fabric associated with deformation and metamorphism in the older basement lithologies 
the majority of gold mineralization on the property  including the awak mas deposit  is predominantly hosted within the flysch sequence  which typically dips at between o and o  generally towards the north 
the majority of gold mineralization is associated with abundant quartz veining and silica albite pyrite alteration  however  the association of gold and quartz is not ubiquitous  with some vein zones appearing to be locally barren of mineralization 
two main styles of mineralization are present 
the first represents broad shallow dipping zones of sheeted and stockwork quartz veining and associated alteration that conform to the shear fabric  especially within the dark  graphitic mudstones 
the other style consists of steeper dipping zones of quartz veining and breccias associated with high angle faults cutting both the flyschoid cover sequence and basement metamorphics 
late stage  north northeast trending normal faults locally disrupt or offset mineralization 
a surface layer of consolidated scree and colluvium averaging to feet maximum feet in thickness veneers the deposit 
the base of weak oxidation within the mineralized sequence typically is within feet of surface 
a final feasibility study was completed by independent consultants in for lone star exploration nl supporting a mining scenario of million metric tons per year of ore 
independent valuations of the project were completed in and as well 
over million has been spent on the project by previous operators 
during  we initiated an exploration program designed to identify drill targets in outlying surface indications of gold mineralization 
the program involved soil and rock geochemistry  drilling shallow test holes to obtain bedrock samples  geologic mapping and interpretation of results 
in  we completed a hole diamond drill program totaling  feet that was designed to upgrade shows of mineralization into reportable amounts

gustavson was commissioned in june to complete a preliminary assessment for vista gold of the project under ni standards 
the study was completed on january   under the direction of john rozelle  an independent qualified person 
the report is titled preliminary assessment  awak mas gold project  sulawesi  indonesia and is dated january  it is available on sedar 
in undertaking the preliminary assessment  gustavson considered the economic and technical parameters associated with development of the mineralized material mineral resources under canadian guidelines by open pit mining 
the study included a process flowsheet based on three stages of laboratory and pilot plant test programs from to the flowsheet was developed by minproc engineers ltd 
in  and reviewed and approved by resource development inc of wheat ridge  colorado  for this study 
the flowsheet includes a flotation circuit to recover gold associated with sulfide minerals following which the concentrate would be treated in a carbon in leach circuit to recover the gold 
the benign tailings from the flotation circuit would flow by gravity into a tailings impoundment and the sulfide tailings would be detoxified  filtered and conveyed to a small dry stack sulfide tailings storage facility 
mwh americas inc of denver and steamboat springs  colorado  prepared the tailings disposal sites layout and closure plans  and assessed permitting requirements 
the potential development included four different scenarios that would produce an estimated to million ounces of gold over a project life of to years 
gustavson estimated the preproduction capital to be million to million  depending on the scenario  and the total capital cost over the project life to be million to million 
the cost estimates used in the preparation of a preliminary assessment are generally accepted as being within plus or minus to of what might be incurred in actual construction and operations 
the costs in the awak mas preliminary assessment are within this level of confidence 
however  this preliminary assessment uses mineral resources mineralized material under sec industry guide and not mineral reserves 
mineral resources mineralized material under sec industry guide that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability 
a determination of mineral reserves would be necessary to demonstrate economic viability of the awak mas gold project

on november   vista gold  through idaho gold resources llc idaho gold  an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of vista gold  entered into an option to purchase agreement with bradley mining company bradley for a nine year option to purchase of yellow pine for  idaho gold made an option payment of  upon execution of the agreement 
the agreement calls for idaho gold to make nine more yearly payments of  on or before each anniversary date of the agreement  for a total option payment price of  and annual payments of  each were made in    and see consolidated financial statements note 
if idaho gold exercises its option to purchase the project  all option payments shall be applied as a credit against the purchase price of  idaho gold has the right to terminate the agreement at any time without penalty 
eleven of the claims are subject to an underlying net smelter returns royalty 
infrastructure and access the project is accessible by existing public gravel roads 
the town of yellow pine  idaho  has year round access 
from yellow pine  the remaining miles of access to the project is by means of a gravel road that is presently not passable in the winter months 
the yellow pine mine operated on an irregular basis from to there is a small open pit and some old buildings in various states of disrepair 
at the present time  vista gold has no installations at or near the yellow pine gold project 
there is no present source of power at the yellow pine gold project  nor has planning advanced to the point of determining the source of power for the project 
at the present  it is assumed that water for the project will be available from wells  pit de watering  and or the east fork of the south fork of the salmon river  but our planning has not advanced to the point of a definitive determination 
geology the yellow pine mining district is located within the cretaceous age idaho batholith  near its eastern border and adjacent to the meadow creek fault zone 
the gold deposits of the yellow pine district are hosted primarily in the quartz monzonites of the idaho batholith and within the major shear and fault zones that transect the district 
ore deposits also occur in the metasediments of a large roof pendant within the granitic rocks 
historic mining of the yellow pine and the homestake open pits on the yellow pine property has depleted the oxide gold mineralization  but significant sulfide gold mineralization remains unmined 
historically  the mine has produced about  ounces of gold from a combination of byproduct gold from tungsten and antimony mining and more recent heap leach production from oxide ore 
gold and antimony occur principally in veinlets  stockworks  fissure fillings  and massive lenses 
gold appears to be associated with pyrite and arsenopyrite whereas silver is associated with antimony 
the primary gold mineralization occurs within a zone of stockwork sulfide veinlets also containing stibnite  pyrite and arsenopyrite 
the principal antimony mineral is stibnite 
tungsten occurs in the mineral scheelite 
deposits are characterized by argillic and sericitic alteration with some silicification 
the meadow creek fault and its subsidiary structures trend north and northeast across the district and are a major controlling factor on the regional mineralization 
the yellow pine mine  the largest mineralized area  is located in the meadow creek fault hanging wall  where the fault strike changes from northerly to northeasterly and a zone of stockwork sulfide veining occurs 
the mineralized zone is about  feet long by feet wide with a vertical extent of up to about  feet 
it is cone shaped with the narrower  bottom area of the cone indicating possible continuity of the mineralization at depth both down dip along the hanging wall of the meadow creek fault and to the northwest 
the homestake area appears as a continuation to the northeast of the yellow pine zone 
the two zones have some similarities as well as differences 
the homestake sulfide zone is also directly associated with the meadow creek fault 
it appears however to have a somewhat different structural style from the yellow pine area 
the mineralized zone is about  feet long by feet wide and up to feet vertically 
it has an overall tabular shape with a true width of about to feet 
drill hole information indicates that the mineralization at homestake is encountered in both the hanging wall of the meadow creek fault zone as well as the footwall 
gold grades tend to be quite a bit lower than at the yellow pine area 
the yellow pine and homestake sulfide zones may be interconnected 
pincock  allen holt pah  of denver  colorado  completed an ni third party technical study for us in november  under the direction of mark g 
stevens  cpg  an independent qualified person  utilizing standard industry software and estimation methodology 
the report is titled yellow pine project  idaho  usa  technical report and is dated november  it is available on sedar 
an assay database for drill holes totaling  feet of drilling was used to estimate mineral resources mineralized material under sec industry guide in the yellow pine and homestake sulfide zones 
based on the report  under sec industry guide guidelines  mineralized material for the yellow pine gold project  above a cut off grade of gold ounces per ton  is estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton 
at the same cut off grade  under canadian institute of mining  metallurgy and petroleum in the cim definition standards  measured mineral resources are estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton  indicated mineral resources are estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton and inferred mineral resources are estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton 
cautionary note to us investors mineral resources are not mineral reserves and there is no assurance that any mineral resources will ultimately be reclassified as proven or probable reserves 
mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability 
us investors should read the cautionary note to us investors regarding reserve and resource estimates above concerning the difference between resources and reserves 
in november  pah completed a ni preliminary assessment under the direction of richard lambert  pe and barton stone  pe  both independent qualified persons 
the study is titled cni technical report  preliminary assessment of the yellow pine project  yellow pine  idaho and is dated december  it is available on sedar 
in undertaking the preliminary assessment  pah considered the economic and technical parameters associated with development of the mineralization by open pit mining 
the study  based on pah s review of previous technical studies and their own work  determined the best treatment approach would be an on site plant to produce a flotation concentrate that would be refined off site 
the potential development would produce an estimated million ounces of gold over a year life 
pah estimated the total capital cost over the project life to be million and preproduction capital to be million 
the cost estimates used in the preparation of a preliminary assessment are generally accepted as being within plus or minus to of what might be incurred in actual construction and operations 
the costs in the yellow pine preliminary assessment are within this level of confidence 
however  this preliminary assessment uses mineral resources mineralized material under sec industry guide and not mineral reserves 
mineral resources mineralized material under sec industry guide that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability 
a determination of mineral reserves would be necessary to demonstrate economic viability of the yellow pine gold project

on january   we executed an option agreement to acquire of the long valley gold project from standard industrial minerals  inc standard 
under the terms of the option agreement  we agreed to pay standard  over five years  with annual payments to be due as follows  due on each of january    and   due on january   and  due on january  we made these payments see consolidated financial statements note  and in january  exercised our option to purchase the property  which is held through vista gold california llc  an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of vista gold 
during the period of through  royal gold  inc royal drilled reverse circulation and core holes at the long valley property 
during this time  royal also completed metallurgical investigations  preliminary engineering studies  including resource estimations  and initiated baseline type environmental studies of the biological  water and archeological resources of the area 
we have acquired all related data from royal in exchange for a net smelter returns royalty to royal 
the database contains drill holes  totaling  feet 
the majority of holes were drilled using reverse circulation methods 
gold was primarily analyzed by fire assay  with grade determinations by atomic absorption 
infrastructure and access the long valley property is located about miles to the east of the town of mammoth lakes and about miles north of the town of bishop  california 
both towns are connected by us highway  which passes a few miles west of the property 
access to the property from the highway is via a series of graded gravel roads 
the property is in an undisturbed condition 
groundwater has been encountered in many exploration drill holes at depths of to feet and should be available in sufficient quantities for processing 
it is believed that adequate power is available in the area with no more than a few miles of additional powerline required to reach the property 
vista gold has no installations at or near the project 
geology the long valley gold project claims are contained entirely within the early pleistocene age long valley caldera  which has been dated at about  years old 
the caldera is an elongated east west oval depression measuring some miles by miles and is related to eruption of the bishop tuff  which is covered by younger rocks within the caldera 
the long valley gold mineralization is located near the center of the caldera and is underlain by lithologic units related to the caldera formation and its subsequent resurgence 
associated with resurgent doming is a sequence of interbedded volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks which were deposited in a lacustrine setting within the caldera 
these rocks consist of sediment siltstones through conglomerates and debris flow deposits  with local deposits of intercalated silica sinter and rhyolite flows and dikes 
all of these lithologies have been altered and or mineralized to variable degrees 
intruding the generally flat lying lake sediments are several rhyolite domes that have been dated from  to  years in age 
the north south trending hilton creek fault zone appears to define the eastern limit of the resurgent dome within the central part of the long valley caldera and extends outside the caldera to the south 
offset along this fault appears to be variable and suggests that fault activity along this zone may be episodic in nature 
gold and silver mineralization at long valley appears to fall under the general classification of an epithermal  low sulfidation type deposit 
several areas  termed the north  central  south  southeast and hilton creek zones  on the long valley property are mineralized with low grades of gold and silver 
the mineralized zones are generally north south trending  up to  feet in length with widths ranging from feet to  feet 
the tabular bodies are generally flat lying or have a shallow easterly dip 
mineralization is typically from to feet thick and  in the south and southeast zones  is exposed at or very near the surface 
the top of the hilton creek zone is covered by to feet of alluvium 
the majority of the mineralization discovered to date is located in the hilton creek zone 
gold and silver mineralization is quite continuous throughout the zones and is well defined above a cut off grade of gold ounces per ton 
within the continuous zones of low grade gold mineralization above gold ounces per ton are numerous zones of higher grade mineralization above gold ounces per ton  particularly in the hilton creek zone  which may relate to zones of enhanced structural preparation 
mineralized zones typically correlate with zones of more intense clay alteration or argillization and or silicification 
in february  mine development associates of reno  nevada mda  completed an ni third party technical study for vista gold on the long valley gold project under the direction of mr 
neil prenn  an independent qualified person 
the study is titled technical report  long valley project  mono county  california  usa and is dated february  it is available on sedar 
based on the report  under sec industry guide guidelines  mineralized material for the yellow pine gold project  above a cut off grade of gold ounces per ton  is estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton 
at the same cut off grade  under canadian institute of mining  metallurgy and petroleum in the cim definition standards  measured mineral resources are estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton  indicated mineral resources are estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton and inferred mineral resources are estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton 
cautionary note to us investors mineral resources are not mineral reserves and there is no assurance that any mineral resources will ultimately be reclassified as proven or probable reserves

us investors should read the cautionary note to us investors regarding reserve and resource estimates above concerning the difference between resources and reserves 
in january  mda completed an ni third party preliminary assessment for vista gold for the long valley gold project under the direction of mr 
neil prenn  an independent qualified person  utilizing standard industry software and estimation methodology 
the study is titled technical report  preliminary assessment  long valley project  mono county  california  usa and is dated january  it is available on sedar 
in undertaking the preliminary assessment  mda considered the economic and technical parameters associated with development of mineral resources mineralized material under sec industry guide within the restraints imposed by the state of california s mining regulations that include a provision that all mined materials not removed from the property be replaced within the perimeter of the excavation 
the preliminary assessment evaluated the potential economics of the project assuming that the mineral resources mineralized material under sec industry guide were mined using open pit mining methods and processed using heap leach technology 
the metallurgical test work and flowsheet were reviewed and approved for this study by resource development inc of wheat ridge  colorado 
after the pit material has been mined  the remaining waste materials would be backfilled into the pit along with the detoxified heap material 
the potential development would produce an estimated  ounces of gold over an eight year mine life 
mda estimated start up capital at million and total project capital at million 
however  this preliminary assessment uses mineral resources mineralized material under sec industry guide and not mineral reserves 
mineral resources mineralized material under sec industry guide that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability 
a determination of mineral reserves would be necessary to demonstrate economic viability of the long valley gold project

an airstrip for small aircraft is located near cosala  with public and private service to the cities of mazatlan  culiacan and durango 
the nearest source of electric power is in cosala 
sporadic underground mining of veins in the district occurred from the s until the s 
currently  vista gold has no installations at or near the project 
geology guadalupe de los reyes occurs in a late cretaceous to tertiary age volcanic sequence of rocks 
gold and silver mineralization has been found along a series of northwesterly and west northwesterly trending structural zones 
mineralization in these zones is typical of low sulfidation epithermal systems 
eight main target areas have been identified along three major structural zones 
several of these targets have bulk tonnage potential which may be amenable to open pit mining  including the el zapote  san miguel  guadalupe mine  tahonitas  and noche buena zones 
the el zapote target occurs in the mariposa el zapote tahonitas structural zone on the western side of the project area and has been mapped for a distance of miles 
the el zapote deposit is one of three deposits found along this structural zone  with the inactive underground mariposa mine miles to the northwest and the tahonitas prospect miles to the southeast 
the guadalupe zone occurs as the northwest extension of the mineralized structures that were developed by underground mining along approximately  feet of the veins and to some  feet deep 
the guadalupe zone is found in the northeast portion of the area and has produced the majority of precious metals within the district 
the san miguel and noche buena zones are enclosed by the same northwestern trending structure in between the el zapote mariposa and the guadalupe structures

as discussed below  we believe that we were a pfic for the taxable year ended december  whether we will be a pfic for the taxable year ending december  depends on our assets and income over the course of such taxable year and  as a result  cannot be predicted with certainty as of the date of this annual report 
see more detailed discussion at additional rules that may apply to us holders below 
there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the determination made by us concerning our pfic status 
accordingly  there can be no assurances that we will be a qfc for the current or any future taxable year 
if we are not a qfc  a dividend paid by us to a us holder  including a us holder that is an individual  estate  or trust  generally will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates and not at the preferential tax rates applicable to long term capital gains

this election is made on a year by year basis and applies to all foreign taxes paid whether directly or through withholding by a us holder during a year 
complex limitations apply to the foreign tax credit  including the general limitation that the credit cannot exceed the proportionate share of a us holder s us federal income tax liability that such us holder s foreign source taxable income bears to such us holder s worldwide taxable income 
in applying this limitation  a us holder s various items of income and deduction must be classified  under complex rules  as either foreign source or us source 
in addition  this limitation is calculated separately with respect to specific categories of income

additional rules that may apply to us holders if we are a controlled foreign corporation  or a passive foreign investment company each as defined below  the preceding sections of this summary may not describe the us federal income tax consequences to us holders of the acquisition  ownership  and disposition of common shares 
controlled foreign corporation we generally will be a controlled foreign corporation under section of the code a cfc if more than of the total voting power or the total value of our outstanding shares are owned  directly or indirectly  by citizens or residents of the us  domestic partnerships  domestic corporations  domestic estates  or domestic trusts each as defined in section a of the code  each of which own  directly or indirectly  or more of the total voting power of our outstanding shares a shareholder 
if we are a cfc  a shareholder generally will be subject to current us federal income tax with respect to a such shareholder s pro rata share of the subpart f income as defined in section of the code of the company and b such shareholder s pro rata share of our earnings invested in united states property as defined in section of the code 
in addition  under section of the code  any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of common shares by a us holder that was a shareholder at any time during the five year period ending with such sale or other taxable disposition generally will be treated as a dividend to the extent of the earnings and profits of the company that are attributable to such common shares 
if we are both a cfc and a pfic as defined below  we generally will be treated as a cfc and not as a pfic with respect to any shareholder 
we do not believe that we have previously been  or currently are a cfc 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not be a cfc for the current or any future taxable year 
passive foreign investment company we generally will be a pfic under section of the code if  for a taxable year  a or more of our gross income for such taxable year is passive income or b or more of the assets held by us either produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income  based on the fair market value of such assets or on the adjusted tax basis of such assets  if we are not publicly traded and either is a controlled foreign corporation or makes an election 
passive income includes  for example  dividends  interest  certain rents and royalties  certain gains from the sale of stock and securities  and certain gains from commodities transactions 
for purposes of the pfic income test and asset test described above  if we own  directly or indirectly  or more of the total value of the outstanding shares of another foreign corporation  we will be treated as if it a held a proportionate share of the assets of such other foreign corporation and b received directly a proportionate share of the income of such other foreign corporation 
in addition  for purposes of the pfic income test and asset test described above  passive income does not include any interest  dividends  rents  or royalties that are received or accrued by us from a related person as defined in section d of the code  to the extent such items are properly allocable to the income of such related person that is not passive income 
we believe that we were a pfic for the taxable year ended december  whether we will be a pfic for the taxable year ending december  depends on our assets and income over the course of the taxable year ending december  and  as a result  cannot be predicted with certainty as of the date of this annual report 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge our determination concerning our pfic status or that we will not be a pfic for the current or any future taxable year 
default pfic rules under section of the code if we are a pfic  the us federal income tax consequences to a us holder of the acquisition  ownership  and disposition of common shares will depend on whether such us holder makes an election to treat the company as a qualified electing fund or qef under section of the code a qef election or a mark to market election under section of the code a mark to market election 
a us holder that does not make either a qef election or a mark to market election will be referred to in this summary as a non electing us holder 
a non electing us holder will be subject to the rules of section of the code with respect to a any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of common shares and b any excess distribution paid on the common shares 
a distribution generally will be an excess distribution to the extent that such distribution together with all other distributions received in the current taxable year exceeds of the average distributions received during the three preceding taxable years or during a us holder s holding period for the common shares  if shorter 
under section of the code  any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of common shares  and any excess distribution paid on the common shares  must be rateably allocated to each day in a non electing us holder s holding period for the common shares 
the amount of any such gain or excess distribution allocated to prior years of such non electing us holder s holding period for the class common shares other than years prior to the first taxable year of the company during such non electing us holder s holding period and beginning after december  for which we was not a pfic will be subject to us federal income tax at the highest tax applicable to ordinary income in each such prior year 
a non electing us holder will be required to pay interest on the resulting tax liability for each such prior year  calculated as if such tax liability had been due in each such prior year 
such a non electing us holder that is not a corporation must treat any such interest paid as personal interest  which is not deductible 
the amount of any such gain or excess distribution allocated to the current year of such non electing us holder s holding period for the common shares will be treated as ordinary income in the current year  and no interest charge will be incurred with respect to the resulting tax liability for the current year 
if we are a pfic for any taxable year during which a non electing us holder holds common shares  we will continue to be treated as a pfic with respect to such non electing us holder  regardless of whether we cease to be a pfic in one or more subsequent years 
a non electing us holder may terminate this deemed pfic status by electing to recognize gain which will be taxed under the rules of section of the code discussed above as if such common shares were sold on the last day of the last taxable year for which the company was a pfic 
qef election a us holder that makes a qef election generally will not be subject to the rules of section of the code discussed above 
however  a us holder that makes a qef election will be subject to us federal income tax on such us holder s pro rata share of a the net capital gain of the company  which will be taxed as long term capital gain to such us holder  and b and the ordinary earnings of the company  which will be taxed as ordinary income to such us holder 
generally  net capital gain is the excess of a net long term capital gain over b net short term capital loss  and ordinary earnings are the excess of a earnings and profits over b net capital gain 
a us holder that makes a qef election will be subject to us federal income tax on such amounts for each taxable year in which we are a pfic  regardless of whether such amounts are actually distributed to such us holder by us 
however  a us holder that makes a qef election may  subject to certain limitations  elect to defer payment of current us federal income tax on such amounts  subject to an interest charge 
if such us holder is not a corporation  any such interest paid will be treated as personal interest  which is not deductible 
a us holder that makes a qef election generally also a may receive a tax free distribution from us to the extent that such distribution represents earnings and profits of the company that were previously included in income by the us holder because of such qef election and b will adjust such us holder s tax basis in the common shares to reflect the amount included in income or allowed as a tax free distribution because of such qef election 
in addition  a us holder that makes a qef election generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition of common shares 
the procedure for making a qef election  and the us federal income tax consequences of making a qef election  will depend on whether such qef election is timely 
a qef election will be treated as timely if such qef election is made for the first year in the us holder s holding period for the common shares in which we were a pfic 
a us holder may make a timely qef election by filing the appropriate qef election documents at the time such us holder files a us federal income tax return for such first year 
however  if we were a pfic in a prior year  then in addition to filing the qef election documents  a us holder must elect to recognize a a gain which will be taxed under the rules of section of the code discussed above as if the common shares were sold on the qualification date or b if we were also a cfc  such us holder s pro rata share of the post earnings and profits of the company as of the qualification date 
the qualification date is the first day of the first taxable year in which we were a qef with respect to such us holder 
the election to recognize such gain or earnings and profits can only be made if such us holder s holding period for the common shares includes the qualification date 
by electing to recognize such gain or earnings and profits  such us holder will be deemed to have made a timely qef election 
in addition  under very limited circumstances  a us holder may make a retroactive qef election if such us holder failed to file the qef election documents in a timely manner 
a qef election will apply to the taxable year for which such qef election is made and to all subsequent taxable years  unless such qef election is invalidated or terminated or the irs consents to revocation of such qef election 
if a us holder makes a qef election and  in a subsequent taxable year  we cease to be a pfic  the qef election will remain in effect although it will not be applicable during those taxable years in which we are not a pfic 
accordingly  if we become a pfic in another subsequent taxable year  the qef election will be effective and the us holder will be subject to the qef rules described above during any such subsequent taxable year in which we qualify as a pfic 
in addition  the qef election will remain in effect although it will not be applicable with respect to a us holder even after such us holder disposes of all of such us holder s direct and indirect interest in the common shares 
accordingly  if such us holder reacquires an interest in the company  such us holder will be subject to the qef rules described above for each taxable year in which we are a pfic 
each us holder should consult its own financial advisor  legal counsel  or accountant regarding the availability of  and procedure for making  a qef election 
us holders should be aware that there can be no assurance that we will satisfy record keeping requirements that apply to a qef  or that we will supply us holders with information that such us holders require to report under the qef rules  in event that we are a pfic and a us holder wishes to make a qef election 
mark to market election a us holder may make a mark to market election only if the common shares are marketable stock 
the common shares generally will be marketable stock if the common shares are regularly traded on a a national securities exchange that is registered with the securities and exchange commission  b the national market system established pursuant to section a of the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  or c a foreign securities exchange that is regulated or supervised by a governmental authority of the country in which the market is located  provided that i such foreign exchange has trading volume  listing  financial disclosure  and other requirements and the laws of the country in which such foreign exchange is located  together with the rules of such foreign exchange  ensure that such requirements are actually enforced and ii the rules of such foreign exchange ensure active trading of listed stocks 
a us holder that makes a mark to market election generally will not be subject to the rules of section of the code discussed above 
however  if a us holder makes a mark to market election after the beginning of such us holder s holding period for the common shares and such us holder has not made a timely qef election  the rules of section of the code discussed above will apply to certain dispositions of  and distributions on  the common shares 
a us holder that makes a mark to market election will include in ordinary income  for each taxable year in which we are a pfic  an amount equal to the excess  if any  of a the fair market value of the common shares as of the close of such taxable year over b such us holder s tax basis in such common shares 
a us holder that makes a mark to market election will be allowed a deduction in an amount equal to the lesser of a the excess  if any  of i such us holder s adjusted tax basis in the common shares over ii the fair market value of such common shares as of the close of such taxable year or b the excess  if any  of i the amount included in ordinary income because of such mark to market election for prior taxable years over ii the amount allowed as a deduction because of such mark to market election for prior taxable years 
a us holder that makes a mark to market election generally also will adjust such us holder s tax basis in the common shares to reflect the amount included in gross income or allowed as a deduction because of such mark to market election 
in addition  upon a sale or other taxable disposition of common shares  a us holder that makes a mark to market election will recognize ordinary income or loss not to exceed the excess  if any  of a the amount included in ordinary income because of such mark to market election for prior taxable years over b the amount allowed as a deduction because of such mark to market election for prior taxable years 
a mark to market election applies to the taxable year in which such mark to market election is made and to each subsequent taxable year  unless the common shares cease to be marketable stock or the irs consents to revocation of such election 
each us holder should consult its own financial advisor  legal counsel  or accountant regarding the availability of  and procedure for making  a mark to market election 
other pfic rules under section f of the code  the irs has issued proposed treasury regulations that  subject to certain exceptions  would cause a us holder that had not made a timely qef election to recognize gain but not loss upon certain transfers of common shares that would otherwise be tax deferred eg  gifts and exchanges pursuant to corporate reorganizations 
however  the specific us federal income tax consequences to a us holder may vary based on the manner in which common shares are transferred 
certain additional adverse rules will apply with respect to a us holder if we are a pfic  regardless of whether such us holder makes a qef election 
for example under section b of the code  a us holder that uses common shares as security for a loan will  except as may be provided in treasury regulations  be treated as having made a taxable disposition of such common shares 
the pfic rules are complex  and each us holder should consult its own financial advisor  legal counsel  or accountant regarding the pfic rules and how the pfic rules may affect the us federal income tax consequences of the acquisition  ownership  and disposition of common shares 
unregistered sales of equity securities our unregistered sales of equity securities during the year ended december   have previously been reported on current reports on form k dated as follows january   february   and march  repurchase of securities during  neither the corporation nor any affiliate of the corporation repurchased common shares of the corporation registered under section of the exchange act

all amounts stated herein are in us dollars in thousands  except loss per share  and gold price per ounce  unless specified otherwise 
overview we are engaged in the evaluation  acquisition  exploration and advancement of gold exploration and potential development projects with the aim of adding value to the projects 
our approach to acquisitions of gold projects has generally been to seek projects within political jurisdictions with well established mining  land ownership and tax laws  which have adequate drilling and geological data to support the completion of a third party review of the geological data and to complete an estimate of the mineralized material mineral resources under canadian guidelines and mineral reserves 
in addition  we look for opportunities to improve the value of our gold projects through exploration drilling and re engineering the operating assumptions underlying previous engineering work 
in  the board of directors and management reevaluated the corporate strategy regarding the development of the corporation s more advanced projects 
as a result of this reevaluation  the corporation has begun moving its more advanced projects toward production by undertaking advanced engineering studies  including feasibility studies as appropriate 
our holdings include the paredones amarillos and guadalupe de los reyes gold projects in mexico  the mt 
todd gold project in australia  the yellow pine gold project in idaho  the long valley gold project in california  the awak mas gold project in indonesia  and claims located in colorado and utah 
we also own approximately of the shares of zamora gold corp  a company exploring for gold in ecuador 
outlook gold prices started at per ounce and finished the year at per ounce as quoted on the london metal exchange morning quote 
this rise of approximately during the year reflected factors such as rising oil prices  global instability  real and threatened terrorism activities  the war in iraq  and the rise in demand for investment and jewelry 
current prices are at a year high and no assurance can be given that such prices will be sustained 
at the end of  we owned or controlled six properties containing mineralized material 
in the early part of  we decided with the higher gold prices  to bring the more advanced projects  such as paredones amarillos and mt 
todd  to production decisions 
the emphasis in late was to start a bankable feasibility study on paredones amarillos with a major mining consultant being contracted to manage this study  which was completed in september in addition  we believe that additional value can be added to most of the remaining projects through exploration drilling and engineering studies  thus advancing them closer to a production decision 
we do not currently generate operating cash flows 
subject to sustained gold prices and the risk factors disclosed in part i item a 
risk factors above  we hope to generate revenues and cash flows in the future 
we may generate revenues and cash flows from our portfolio of gold projects by several means  including but not limited to options or leases to third parties  joint venture arrangements with other gold producers  outright sales for cash and or royalties  or project development and operation 
with respect to our current property holdings  aggregate expenditures for purchase installments  to maintain options and conduct exploration activities are currently anticipated being approximately  in and  in as at december   we had working capital of  and cash on hand of  at present  we believe that the current cash balances as of december  of  and marketable securities of  will cover these activities as well as general and administrative expenses and our semi annual interest payments associated with the notes through in subsequent years  we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to meet property purchase installment obligations and scheduled payments on those properties that we decide to retain under option 
further  additional capital would be necessary to advance the projects to a positive production decisions  and to conduct additional exploration drilling and engineering studies on current properties 
additional capital may be raised via revenues  if earned  equity and or debt financings 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in efforts to raise additional capital 
results from operations summary our consolidated net loss was  or per share compared to the consolidated net loss of  or per share for a net decrease of  the decrease of  in is primarily the result of the impairment of the amayapampa gold project of  and costs related to the completion of the arrangement agreement of  both of which occurred during the period 
these amounts are offset by decreased interest income of  an increase in interest expense of  an increase in the income tax expense of  an increase in the impairment loss of with respect to certain marketable securities  costs to dispose of the amayapampa gold project of and an increase in the loss on currency translation of our consolidated net loss was  or per share compared to the consolidated net loss of  or per share for a net increase of  the increase of  in is primarily the result of the impairment of the amayapampa project of  costs related to the completion of the arrangement of  increased corporate administration and investor relations costs of  and increased exploration  property evaluation and holdings costs of  partially offset by an increase in the income tax benefit of  exploration  property evaluation and holding costs exploration  property evaluation and holding costs increased to  during the year ended december   compared with for the same period in the increase of is primarily due to increases in holding costs at the paredones amarillos gold project of and the mt 
todd gold project of the increase in costs at the paredones amarillos gold project reflects increasing consultant fees for activities related to permitting and other administrative work and accounting fees as we evaluate financial and tax implications to vista gold as we move the project towards a development decision 
the increase at the mt 
todd gold project is primarily the result of an increase in tenement expenditures 
exploration  property evaluation and holding costs increased to during the year ended december   compared with for the same period in the increase of is primarily due to an increase in holding costs at the paredones amarillos project of the increase reflects increasing consultant fees for activities related to permitting and other administrative work and accounting fees as we evaluate financial and tax implications to vista gold as we move the project towards a development decision 
the remaining increase can be attributed to vista gold s increased business development efforts following the completion of the arrangement 
corporate administration and investor relations corporate administration and investor relations costs increased to  during the year ended december   compared to  in the slight increase of from the prior period is primarily due to an increase in labor and benefit costs of  which is mostly the result of a severance charge of for lay offs at the awak mas gold project and increased salary and benefit charges of for the addition of new employees as we head towards the development of certain projects 
corporate administration and investor relations costs increased to  during the year ended december   compared to  in the increase of  from the prior period is primarily due to the following an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense of  compared to the prior period 
this is due to an increase of for options vesting immediately upon the grant date  an increase of from the prior year for options granted and vesting over time and a decrease of in the allocation of stock based compensation expense to allied nevada during the period  a decrease in the allocation of certain corporate expenses to allied nevada as part of the arrangement agreement of compared to the prior period  an increase in labor and benefit costs of compared to the prior period 
this increase is due to the addition of employees as we head towards anticipated development of certain projects  and an increase in investor relations costs of compared to prior period 
this increase is due to increased communication programs resulting from a change in strategic direction towards production and the need to communicate developmental issues on one of our projects in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased to during the twelve month period ended december  as compared to for the same period in this increase is mostly due to capital expenditures at both the mt 
todd gold mine and the paredones amarillos gold project during that have begun being depreciated 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to during the twelve month period ended december  as compared to for the same period in this increase is mostly due to capital expenditures at the mt 
todd gold mine during that have begun being depreciated 
other income and expenses interest income interest income was during the twelve month period ended december   as compared to  for the same period in the decrease of  from the respective prior period is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest earned on our liquid savings accounts as compared to the same period in this decrease is due to vista gold s decision to no longer purchase short term commercial paper due to the declining interest rates in the market 
interest income increased to  during the twelve month period ended december  as compared to for the same period in this increase is the result of an increase in interest earned on our liquid savings account which can be attributed to higher cash balances and higher interest rates 
interest expense interest expense was  during the twelve month period ended december  of this amount  is attributable to the accretion of the debt discount and  is attributable to interest expense 
these amounts are approximately of the full interest expense associated with the issuance of the notes 
we are able to capitalize the remaining as additions to mineral properties in accordance with sfas no 
and our accounting policy 
during and  we did not incur any interest expense as we had no commercial debt during these years 
gain loss on disposal of marketable securities in  we realized a loss on disposal of marketable securities of  compared to a gain of in and a gain of in in the loss on disposal of marketable securities was the result of selling certain available for sale securities that had a book value of for proceeds of in the gain on disposal of marketable securities was the result of selling certain available for sale securities that had a book value of for proceeds of we allocated of the gain on disposal of marketable securities to allied nevada as part of the completion of the arrangement agreement 
these costs were allocated as part of the general overhead income and expense allocation 
in the gain on disposal of marketable securities was the result of selling certain available for sale securities that had a book value of for proceeds of we allocated of the gain on disposal of marketable securities to allied nevada as part of the completion of the arrangement agreement 
these costs were allocated as part of the general overhead income and expense allocation 
at december   we held marketable securities available for sale with a quoted market value of  with the exception of our shares of allied nevada common stock  as discussed herein  we purchased the securities for investing purposes with the intent to hold the securities until such time that it would be advantageous to sell the securities at a gain 
although there can be no reasonable assurance that a gain will be realized from the sale of the securities  the market status of the securities is consistently monitored in order to mitigate the risk of loss on the investment 
at december   also included in marketable securities were  shares of allied nevada common stock at a quoted market value of  we will hold these shares until such time that it would be advantageous to sell the securities at a gain 
income tax benefit expense effective september   the corporation adopted eic  which provides guidance on whether the tax benefit from the recognition of previously unrecognized tax loss carryforwards consequent to the recording of unrealized gains in other comprehensive income  such as unrealized gains on available for sale financial assets  should be recognized in net income or in other comprehensive income 
eic should be applied retrospectively  with restatement of prior periods from january   the date of adoption of cica income tax expense was for the year ended december  as compared to an income tax benefit of  for the period 
the increase of  in expense as compared to the benefit from the period is attributable to the declining market during  in which we have had more unrealized losses as compared to where we had more unrealized gains 
there was no income tax benefit or expense during the period as the company had not yet adopted cica and as a result did not record unrealized holding gains or losses on its available for sale securities 
write down of marketable securities the write down of marketable securities was for the year ended december  as compared to a write down of marketable securities of for the period 
there were no write downs during the year ended december  at december   vista gold evaluated the market value of its available for sale securities and found that certain securities had become impaired 
these securities were written down to their fair market value as of december  in  the write down of marketable securities was due to the expiration of warrants with a value of financial position  liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash used in operating activities in was  compared to  in and  in the increase of  in as compared to is mostly the result of aggregate interest payments of  made on june  and december  for the notes and an increase in the loss from continuing operations of  which has been partially offset by an increase in non cash items of  net cash used in operating activities in was  compared to  in the increase of  in as compared to is primarily due to an increase in the loss from continuing operations of  and an increase in cash used for accounts payable  accrued liabilities and other of  which is partially offset by an increase in non cash items of  investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was  compared to  in the decrease of  is mostly the result of a decrease of  in the cash transferred to allied nevada in conjunction with the completion of the plan of arrangement in may  which has been offset by the following an increase in additions to plant and equipment of  on march   with the completion of a brokered private placement of  principal amount of the notes see financing activities below we used  of the proceeds towards the purchase of gold processing equipment to be used at our paredones amarillos gold project 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately  which included the costs of relocating the equipment to edmonton  alberta  canada 
the purchase was finalized in april with the completion of the relocation of the major equipment components to edmonton 
there were no similar purchases during the period 
an increase in the acquisition of mineral properties of on january   we completed the acquisition of interests in various mineral properties adjacent to our guadalupe de los reyes gold project in mexico 
the consideration paid by vista gold for the acquisition of these interests included cash payments totaling and the issuance of a total of  common shares of vista gold with an aggregate fair value of  to various parties 
an increase in the additions to mineral properties of  this increase primarily reflects the costs associated with the feasibility study for the paredones amarillos gold project and a drilling program at the mt 
todd gold project 
net cash used in investing activities in was  compared to  in the increase of  mostly reflects  cash transferred to allied nevada in conjunction with the arrangement agreement representing our payment of  less in loans repaid to us by allied nevada pursuant to the terms of the arrangement agreement 
other variances include an increase in additions to mineral properties of  which is mostly due to a drilling program we undertook at the mt 
todd gold project during and a decrease in expenditures related to acquisitions of gold properties of  there were no acquisitions during as compared to the acquisition of the mt 
todd gold project in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  for the twelve month period ended december   as compared to  for the same period in this increase is primarily the result of the completion of a brokered private placement on march  in which we offered and sold  in aggregate principal amount of senior secured convertible notes the notes see consolidated financial statements note

other components include marketable securities   accounts receivable  and other liquid assets  
the decrease of  in working capital from to relates to the decrease in cash balances from to and a decline in market values of our marketable securities 
as a result of the delay in the issuance of the change of land use permit at the paredones amarillos gold project and the current uncertainty in the resource and financial markets  management has adopted a revised plan and budget for the year the plan continues those programs necessary to expedite the development of the paredones amarillos gold project  while minimizing expenditures in other areas 
the budget estimates that in the event that financing for the paredones amarillos gold project is not available on acceptable terms in  vista gold has sufficient working capital to fund its planned operations at least through the end of  without additional financing 
we will continue to examine potential funding alternatives for the project  which may include project financing  debt financing or equity financing 
on march   the corporation completed a private placement in which the corporation issued and sold million in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the notes were issued on march  and mature at face value on march  the maturity date 
the notes pay interest of per annum 
interest is payable each year in two installments on june and december  and the principal is payable on the maturity date 
the notes are convertible at the holder s or issuer s discretion in accordance with the terms of the notes 
the holder can convert all or part of the debt at any time prior to the maturity date or the business day immediately preceding the redemption date at a price of per common share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
the redemption date represents the date that the notes will be redeemed in the event that we redeem the notes 
we can convert all  but not part  of the notes after march  if the weighted average price of our shares as quoted on the nyse amex has been equal to or greater than per share for consecutive trading days 
the notice of conversion must occur within days of any such day period and the share price must be equal to or greater than on the date the notice is delivered 
the conversion price is per common share subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
pursuant to the terms of the notes  on march   the conversion price of the notes was automatically adjusted from per share to per share 
as a result of the adjustment  million common shares are issuable upon conversion of the notes 
prior to the adjustment million common shares were issuable upon the conversion of the notes 
the notes have been accounted for in accordance with eic  convertible and other debt instruments with embedded derivatives 
under eic  the fair value of the conversion feature is recorded as equity 
the issuance date fair value of the conversion feature was estimated to be million and was classified as the equity component of convertible notes with the residual balance of million being recorded as the fair value of the corporation s obligation to make principal and interest payments and has been classified as long term debt 
the issuance date fair value of the warrants of  and legal fees and other expenses of million related to the issuance of these notes have been allocated pro rata between debt issuance costs of  and equity issuance costs of  the transaction costs are added to the cost of the convertible debt and presented as a reduction of the related debt and equity portions 
the issuance costs related to the debt portion will be amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method 
vista capitalizes interest and accretion based on expenditures on qualifying assets 
as of december   vista had qualifying expenditures of approximately million related to the equipment purchase for the paredones amarillos project 
vista has used approximately million of the proceeds for ongoing operations at the paredones amarillos gold project  which includes approximately million towards the purchase of gold processing equipment 
vista has million remaining that will be used to fund ongoing operations pursuant to the covenants of the notes

vista gold antigua indirectly held our interest in the amayapampa gold project in bolivia 
under the terms of the agreement  republic agreed to pay vista gold million in three payments of million 
the first of these payments is due and payable upon the start of commercial production as defined in the purchase and sale agreement  see exhibit hereto at amayapampa followed by million payments on each of the first and second anniversaries of the start of commercial production 
in addition  republic agreed to pay vista gold a nsr on the gold produced by or on behalf of republic from the amayapampa gold project in varying percentages depending on the price of gold per ounce 
when gold is between and per ounce  a nsr is payable  when the price of gold is between and per ounce  a nsr is payable  and when the price of gold is per ounce and above  an nsr of is payable 
the nsr is capped at  gold equivalent ounces and no nsr payments are due to vista gold if the gold price is below per ounce 
vista gold retains a first right of refusal in the event republic decides to sell the property and also retains a right to re acquire the property if republic or vista gold antigua have not moved to close a financing under a project financing facility by april  under the terms of the transaction  vista gold agreed to lend to republic for ongoing expenses on the amayapampa gold project 
the loan was completed on april  interest on the loan accrues and is payable at the rate of per annum  payable monthly 
on september   we received from republic  which included principal and in accrued interest 
the fair value of the consideration received on disposal of the amayapampa gold project has been calculated as of december  using probability weighted cash flow scenarios and assumptions including future gold prices  estimated gold production and the timing of commencement of commercial production 
these inputs in the income approach valuation model used by vista gold are considered to be level three unobservable inputs as defined by sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
these are vista gold s own assumptions based on our best estimates and the best information available to us at the time 
prime corporate finance pty limited pcf of west perth  australia served as corporate advisor to vista gold in connection with the above transaction 
in compensation for the advisory services provided by pcf  vista gold had agreed to pay pcf a success fee of of the face value of any completed transaction 
on april   vista gold and pcf agreed that the success fee payable to pcf was such amount being equivalent to cdn 
in addition  on april   pcf and vista gold agreed that the success fee would be payable in common shares of vista gold 
based on the market price of vista gold s common shares at the close of business on april  of cdn 
per common share   vista gold common shares were issuable to pcf 
completion of the share issuance occurred on june  updated report on status of change of land use permit for paredones amarillos gold project and expected development timetable on april   vista gold announced that it had received correspondence from the la paz  baja california sur office of semarnat indicating that staff in that office are of the opinion that the change of land use permit approved by semarnat in in relation to vista gold s paredones amarillos gold project in bcs  mexico  is no longer valid 
this permit is necessary for the development of the paredones amarillos gold project to proceed 
vista gold s advisors and counsel in mexico have advised vista gold that they believe that the permit remains valid 
vista gold s legal counsel in mexico has advised vista gold to proceed with a judicial appeal of the opinion issued by the bcs office of semarnat to preserve certain legal rights  but has also recommended that a new application is likely to be the most expeditious way to obtain the necessary approvals 
on july   vista gold reported that it has taken steps to preserve its right to proceed with a judicial appeal of the opinion issued by the bcs office of semarnat and has also completed a number of steps prerequisite to submitting an application for a new change of land use permit 
as well  we indicated our intention to submit an application for an interim change of land use permit for the drilling program 
changes in the law governing the change of land use permit require vista gold to demonstrate that it has the right to use the surface affected by the permit 
in december  vista gold signed an agreement with a private landowner for the purchase of the remaining surface land required by the project 
this land covers the area of the mill site  tailing impoundment and various ancillary facilities 
the documents supporting vista gold s right to use the surface  together with a new environmental impact analysis completed in august and other supporting documents  will form the basis of the new change of land use permit application 
vista gold received a certificate from the general direction of mines in the ministry of economy verifying that vista gold s mexican subsidiary  minera paredones amarillos sa de cv mpa  is the rightful holder of valid mineral rights for the paredones amarillos gold project 
vista gold also received an official appraisal of the surface land in the project area from the national institute for the appraisal and administration of national property confirming that the surface overlying a significant part of these mineral rights including the proposed pit and most of the dumps is federal land 
under mexican mining statutes  mpa has the constitutional right to use the surface for mining activities  subject to applicable environmental permits and federal authorizations 
this position has been further confirmed in the foregoing certificate issued by the general direction of mines in the ministry of economy 
one of the mechanisms for authorizing the use of federal land for mining activities is a temporary occupation permit lasting the life of the mining activity 
on january   we announced an update to the permitting status at our paredones amarillos gold project in mexico 
as previously announced see press releases dated july and september   vista gold indicated that it had decided to apply for a new change of land use permit cusf 
in a press release dated november   we indicated that we had presented an application for a temporary occupation permit top for the use of the federal land which overlies the deposit 
the top is a necessary pre requisite for the cusf application 
we have not yet received the top  which was expected by the end of communications with the office of the general director of mines in the ministry of economy the department responsible for awarding the top indicate that the approval process is proceeding normally  but at a slower pace than expected 
we have the necessary environmental permit and have completed the other prerequisite studies for the submittal of the cusf permit application and will file that permit application as soon as the top is received 
if vista gold is unable to secure permits for the paredones amarillos gold project  we will have no reserves under sec industry guide since we would not be able to legally mine the property 
additional information is contained in our press releases dated april  may  may  july  september and november  and january  vista gold announced the results of a definitive feasibility study for the paredones amarillos gold project on september  following the successful completion of project financing and the issuance of a new change of land use permit  it is expected that construction of the paredones amarillos gold project would commence shortly thereafter 
the construction period is planned to be twelve months and gold production would commence after a short commissioning and start up period 
we cannot assure you that financing for the project will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to secure financing for the project  construction could be delayed indefinitely 
paredones amarillos gold project feasibility study results on september   vista gold announced the results of the feasibility study the study on the paredones amarillos gold project 
the study was prepared by srk  an independent third party 
the study is titled feasibility study  ni technical report  vista gold corp  paredones amarillos gold project  baja california sur  mexico

general paredones amarillos is located miles southeast of the city of la paz  in the mexican state of baja california sur and is accessed by paved and dirt roads 
the project area covers about  acres 
the study includes a description of the geology  mining and milling operations  tailings impoundment facility  desalination plant  and all project associated infrastructure  estimated resources and reserves  and the proposed mining plan with the associated mining and processing equipment 
the paredones amarillos deposit is a silicified shear zone locally known as cataclasite 
the shear zone generally lies between the granodiorite basement rock and a diorite cap 
the proposed pit is oriented approximately east west and would have two distinct lobes 
the metallurgical recovery is estimated to be for gold 
capital and operating cost estimates estimated life of mine average cash production costs are projected to be per ounce  with lower costs of per ounce projected during the first five years of production 
operating costs used diesel prices effective as of may and energy prices effective as of the first quarter  both of which were relatively unaffected by the dramatic changes in world crude oil prices 
pre production capital costs  including contingency  owner s costs and working capital  are estimated to be million or per ounce of gold produced 
total capital costs including replacement and reclamation over the life of the project are estimated to be per ounce of gold produced 
estimates of mineralized material mineral resources under canadian guidelines and mineral reserves a new estimate of mineral resources mineralized material under sec industry guide was completed  dated september   by mine development associates under the direction of mr 
ristorcelli  an independent qualified person  and is part of the feasibility report 
the estimate was prepared using industry standard software and estimation methodologies 
previous technical reports contain extensive geologic and technical information related to the deposit for which the estimate was prepared 
the last technical report was filed on sedar on june   and is entitled the updated technical report paredones amarillos project  baja california sur  mexico  and is dated june  the drilling and associated work used in the estimate was undertaken between and  but most of the drilling was completed between and of the holes in the data base  holes containing  samples were used in the resource estimate 
mr 
ristorcelli reviewed available information necessary for the preparation of the resource estimate  including sampling  analytical  drilling and geologic 
following a review of the available documentation pertaining to the sampling programs  the data was deemed sufficiently accurate to use for resource estimation 
however  mr 
ristorcelli noted that some of the early program s quality assurance and quality control procedures were poorly documented and that an apparent bias may exist between some of the assay values and the check assay values of the same samples 
as the original samples were not preserved and cannot be re assayed  at vista gold s request  mr 
ristorcelli has recommended a to hole drill program to confirm the validity of the resource model that relied on those assays whose check assay bias is unresolved 
mr 
ristorcelli undertook multiple checks to assess the validity of the model and classified the resource into measured  indicated and inferred mineral resource categories under ni under sec industry guide guidelines  mineralized material at a cut off grade of gold ounces per ton totals  tons grading gold ounces per ton 
under the canadian institute of mining  metallurgy and petroleum in the cim definition standards  using a cutoff grade of gold ounces per ton  measured mineral resources are estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton  indicated mineral resources are estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton and inferred mineral resources are estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton 
cautionary note to us investors mineral resources are not mineral reserves and there is no assurance that any mineral resources will ultimately be reclassified as proven or probable reserves 
mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability 
us investors should read the cautionary note to us investors regarding reserve and resource estimates above concerning the difference between resources and reserves 
the mineral reserve estimates prepared and reported by mine development associates  under the supervision of mr 
dyer  an independent qualified person  at a gold price of per ounce of gold and cut off grade of gold ounces per ton are summarized in the following table 
reserves estimated at paredones amarillos reserve classification short tons x average gold grade ounces ton proven  probable  proven probable  cautionary note to us investors concerning estimates of proven and probable reserves the estimates of mineral reserves shown in this table have been prepared in accordance with ni the definitions of proven and probable reserves used in ni differ from the definitions in sec industry guide accordingly  the company s disclosure of mineral reserves herein may not be comparable to information from us companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the us securities and exchange commission 
us investors should read the cautionary note to us investors regarding reserve and resource estimates above 
as of january   the rolling three year average gold price was  which is slightly higher than the gold price used by mine development associates for the mineral reserves reported in the table above 
therefore  under sec industry guide requirements  we feel the mineral reserves listed above are conservative 
however  should we not be able to obtain permits to mine the property  the project would not have mineral reserves under sec industry guide guidelines 
mining we plan to extract ore from the mine using conventional open pit mining equipment and techniques 
a ton truck and loader fleet was selected 
vista gold will be the owner and operator of the fleet 
the higher grade west lobe would be mined first and a significant portion of the waste rock from the east lobe would be used to backfill the west lobe of the pit 
concurrent reclamation of two waste dumps would be completed during the latter years of the operation 
processing we intend to process the ore in a conventional crushing and grinding circuit consisting of a primary gyratory crusher followed by a semi autogenous grinding mill and two ball mills with an expected mill ore throughput rate of  tonnes per day 
the crushing and grinding equipment was previously acquired by vista gold from the colomac mine and is presently in edmonton  canada  waiting shipment to arizona for repairs and reconditioning 
as previously reported  the cost of this equipment was approximately million  with funds provided from the private placement of the notes 
the proposed flow sheet indicates that following grinding  the slurried ore will be sized by cyclones and then leached in tanks prior to gold recovery using a kemix carbon in pulp circuit 
gold will be stripped from the carbon and precipitated in an electrowinning cell prior to refining into dor bars 
the tailings will be detoxified using ferrous sulfate  paste thickened and deposited in a lined tailings impoundment facility on site 
water  power  fuel and access due to the scarcity of surface water and political sensitivities regarding the use of groundwater  vista gold has elected to construct and operate a desalination plant on the pacific coast  which is about airline miles to the west 
the length of the pipeline to transport desalinated sea water to the project is dependent on the ultimate route chosen  however  miles was used in the feasibility study 
annual water consumption is estimated to be million gallons 
high voltage electrical power will be available from an existing sub station located approximately miles north of the project area 
we intend to construct a new power line from the sub station to the project 
the power line design has been completed and the right of way agreements are in place 
we expect that energy for the project will be supplied by the comisi n federal de electr cidad 
it is anticipated that diesel fuel for the project will be provided in bulk quantities by petroleos de mexico 
fuel prices in mexico are subsidized and have not experienced the volatility seen in other locations 
the project site is currently accessible by government maintained dirt roads from the north and the west 
the project site is currently accessible existing public roads paved highway to within miles of the project on the north then by government maintained dirt roads from the north 
there is also a government maintained dirt road from the west 
the main access will be from the north 
we plan to widen and improve approximately six miles of existing roads from the north and to construct approximately five miles of new road immediately north of the project 
socio economic considerations the project is remotely located and is not expected to directly affect any local inhabitants 
the access road improvements will benefit the villages of valle perdido and el rosario 
vista gold is currently working with the local education and health care authorities and has become a social partner with the elementary school in el rosario 
vista gold is unaware of any social issues related to the development of the project 
permits see updated report on status of change of land use permit for paredones amarillos gold project and expected development timetable above 
economic analysis the economic analysis was completed using a gold price profile with a gold price of per ounce in the first three years of production  decreasing to per ounce for the remainder 
this is considered to be the base case 
the analysis has also been completed using a fixed price with alternative sensitivity analyses completed at gold prices of  and per ounce 
the economic analyses were conducted on equity basis with no consideration of debt or leasing 
estimated before and after tax economic results  showing the internal rate of return irr and net present value at a discount rate npv  cumulative cash flow and sensitivity of the base case to changes in gold prices are presented in the following tables

current debt and equity markets are uncertain and vista gold is focusing its efforts on completing final permitting and other tasks that will expedite the development of the project 
when permitting and financing is complete  the construction period is planned take twelve months and gold production would commence after a short commissioning and start up period 
as noted above  we have already purchased the major mill equipment with funds raised in our private placement of the notes 
prior to the completion of financing  we intend to identify the remaining long delivery items for order and will examine alternative construction management and project execution arrangements 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may be required to delay development and construction until economic conditions and the financial markets improve  which delays may adversely affect our financial condition 
update on progress at the mt 
todd gold project in late february  we announced an ni updated estimate for vista gold of mineralized material mineral resources under canadian guidelines by tetra tech of golden  colorado 
this updated estimate was completed under the direction of mr 
john rozelle  pg  an independent qualified person  utilizing standard industry software and estimation methodology 
the study is titled mt todd gold project gold resource update  northern territory  australia and dated march  it is available on sedar 
results of prior drilling plus the additional drilling we completed in were included in the estimate 
based on the report  under sec industry guide guidelines  mineralized material for the batman deposit  above a cut off grade of gold ounces per ton  is estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton  and represents an increase of in mineralized material over the prior estimate 
at the same cut off grade  under canadian institute of mining  metallurgy and petroleum in the cim definition standards  measured mineral resources are estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton  indicated mineral resources are estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton and inferred mineral resources are estimated at  tons grading gold ounces per ton

these resource estimates complement the updated estimate of gold mineralized material gold mineral resources under canadian guidelines for the batman deposit we announced in february  the estimates incorporate the results of  assay intervals from drill holes all core holes drilled by vista gold in with assaying completed by northern australia labs in pine creek and als chemex in perth 
these results are in addition to the results of copper assays completed on random intervals from drill holes core  reverse circulation and rotary drill holes done by bhp resources pty ltd  zapopan nl and pegasus gold australia pty ltd 
from the un mined portion of the drill holes previously completed by bhp  zapopan  pegasus  we submitted  intervals of core for re assay and multi element analysis 
the re assay and multi element analysis was completed by als chemex in perth and has been incorporated into the estimates

cautionary note to us investors mineral resources are not mineral reserves and there is no assurance that any mineral resources will ultimately be reclassified as proven or probable reserves 
mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability 
us investors should read the cautionary note to us investors regarding reserve and resource estimates above concerning the difference between resources and reserves 
also in  we completed a hole   foot diamond drill program designed to test the down dip extension of mineralization within the pit shape drilled and evaluated in  the continuity of mineralization below that pit shape and to obtain a sample for ongoing metallurgical testing 
in late january  we announced the results of an updated ni gold resource estimate on the batman deposit completed for us by tetra tech of golden  colorado

as we announced in november  preliminary tests using high pressure grinding rolls have been very successful  indicating a reduction in crushing and grinding energy requirements compared to conventional technologies of approximately 
we plan to conduct additional studies in which will be used in the completion of a preliminary feasibility study for a project similar in scope to that considered in the previously published preliminary assessment january  
subsequent events paredones amarillos gold project permit update on january   we announced an update to the permitting status at our paredones amarillos gold project in mexico 
as previously announced see press releases dated july and september   vista gold indicated that it had decided to apply for a new change of land use permit cusf 
in a press release dated november   we indicated that we had presented an application for a temporary occupation permit top for the use of the federal land which overlies the deposit 
the top is a necessary pre requisite for the cusf application 
we have not yet received the top  which was expected by the end of communications with the office of the general director of mines in the ministry of economy the department responsible for awarding the top indicate that the approval process is proceeding normally 
we have the necessary environmental permit and completed the other prerequisite studies for the submittal of the cusf permit application and will file that permit application as soon as the top is received

significant accounting policies  changes in accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements significant accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in canada requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant areas requiring the use of estimates include useful lives for asset depreciation purposes  impairment of mineral properties and stock based compensation 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
mineral properties mineral property acquisition costs and exploration costs are recorded at cost and are deferred until the viability of the property is determined 
general overhead  administrative and holding costs to maintain a property on a care and maintenance basis are expensed in the period they are incurred 
if a project would be put into production  capitalized costs would be depleted on the unit of production basis 
option payments and reimbursements received are treated as a recovery of mineral property costs 
option payments are at the discretion of the optionee and accordingly are accounted for on a cash basis or when receipt is reasonably assured 
our management regularly reviews the net carrying value of each mineral property 
where information and conditions suggest impairment  estimated future cash flows are calculated using estimated future prices  proven and probable reserves  weighted probable outcomes and operating capital and reclamation costs on an undiscounted basis 
if it is determined that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  a write down to the estimated fair value is made with a charge to loss for the period 
where estimates of future net cash flows are not available and where other conditions suggest impairment  management assesses if carrying values can be recovered 
stock based compensation and other stock based payments the corporation records compensation expense on the granting of all stock based compensation awards  including stock options grants to employees  calculated using the fair value method 
the corporation uses the hull white trinomial method of determining the fair value of the option on the date of the grant 
when an employee or non employee is granted stock options  the fair value of the immediately vested portion is expensed and included within the stock options balance within equity 
as to the options vesting  the fair value is amortized using the straight line method over the vesting period and expensed on a monthly basis 
when an employee or non employee exercises stock options  then the fair value of the options on the date of the grant is transferred to common stock 
when options are cancelled  the vested fair value balance of the stock options is transferred to contributed surplus 
when stock options are forfeited prior to becoming fully vested  any expense and fair value previously recorded are reversed out accordingly 
when options expire  the related fair value is transferred to contributed surplus 
financial instruments effective january   the corporation adopted cica handbook sections  comprehensive income   financial instruments recognition and measurement and  financial instruments disclosure and presentation 
the adoption of these new sections had no impact on the corporation s financial statements on or before december  as the sections require adjustments to the carrying value of available for sale securities to be recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income on transition 
upon adoption of these sections  the corporation made a one time adjustment to the opening balance  as of january   of accumulated other comprehensive income in the amount of all available for sale securities are measured at fair value 
gains and losses associated with these available for sale securities will be separately recorded as unrealized within other comprehensive income until such time the security is disposed of or becomes impaired  at which time any gains or losses will then be realized and reclassified to the statement of loss 
upon adoption of the new section financial instruments  all regular way purchases of financial assets are accounted for at trade date 
transaction costs on financial assets are treated as part of the investment cost 
changes in accounting policies during effective january   we adopted the following accounting standards updates issued by the cica  with the exception of eic which was adopted as of september  these new standards  with the exception of eic  have been adopted on a prospective basis with no restatement of prior period financial statements 
eic has been adopted retrospectively 
cica section  capital disclosures requires the disclosure of an entity s objectives  policies and processes for managing capital  quantitative data about what the entity regards as capital and whether the entity has complied with any capital requirements and  if it has not complied  the consequences of such noncompliance 
the corporation s objective is to ensure the corporation s ability to continue as a going concern  so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders 
the corporation considers items included in its shareholders equity and its convertible debt as capital 
the corporation manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets 
in order to maintain or adjust the capital structure  the corporation may issue new shares through equity financings to reduce debt 
the corporation is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements 
see notes    and cica section  general standards of financial statement presentation  was amended to include requirements to assess and disclose an entity s ability to continue as a going concern 
the new requirements are effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after january  the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
cica section  financial instruments disclosures and section  financial instruments presentations are two standards that replace section  financial instruments disclosure and presentation  revising disclosures related to financial instruments and carry forward unchanged presentation requirements 
these standards increase the disclosures currently required  which will enable users to evaluate the significance of financial instruments for an entity s financial position and performance  including disclosures about fair value 
in addition  disclosure is required of qualitative and quantitative information about exposure to risks arising from financial instruments  including specified minimum disclosure about credit  liquidity and market risk 
the quantitative disclosures must provide information about the extent to which the entity is exposed to risk  based on information provided internally to the entity s key management personnel 
effective september   the corporation adopted the emerging issues committee abstract eic  income statement presentation of a tax loss carryforward recognized following an unrealized gain in other comprehensive income 
eic provides guidance on whether the tax benefit from the recognition of previously unrecognized tax loss carryforwards consequent to the recording of unrealized gains in other comprehensive income  such as unrealized gains on available for sale financial assets  should be recognized in net income or in other comprehensive income 
eic should be applied retrospectively  with restatement of prior periods from january   the date of adoption of cica as defined below section  financial instruments recognition and measurement 
the adoption of eic resulted in a reclassification of  of income tax recovery from the accumulated other comprehensive income balance to the accumulated deficit as of december  it also decreased the corporation s three month losses and nine month losses for the period ended september  by  and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the cica issued section  goodwill and intangible assets  which replaces section  goodwill and intangible assets  and results in a withdrawal of cica section  research and development costs  and amendments to accounting guideline acg  enterprises in the development stage  and cica section  financial statement concepts 
also  eic is no longer applicable for entities that have adopted cica the standard intends to reduce the differences with international financial reporting standards ifrs in the accounting for intangible assets and results in closer alignment with us gaap 
under current canadian standards  more items are recognized as assets than under ifrs or us gaap 
the objectives of cica section are to reinforce the principle based approach to the recognition of assets only in accordance with the definition of an asset and the criteria for asset recognition  and clarify the application of the concept of matching revenues and expenses such that the current practice of recognizing assets that do not meet the definition and recognition criteria are eliminated 
the standard will also provide guidance for the recognition of internally developed intangible assets including research and development activities  ensuring consistent treatment of all intangible assets  whether separately acquired or internally developed 
this standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after october  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard in international financial reporting standards ifrs in  the canadian accounting standards boards acsb published a new strategic plan that will significantly affect financial reporting requirements for canadian companies 
the acsb strategic plan outlines the convergence of canadian gaap with ifrs over an expected five year transitional period 
in february  the acsb announced that is the changeover date for publicly listed companies to use ifrs  replacing canadian gaap 
this date is for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after january  the transition date of january  will require the restatement for comparative purposes of amounts reported by the corporation for the year ended december  in july  acsb announced that early adoption will be allowed in subject to seeking exemptive relief 
we are currently assessing the financial reporting impact of the transition to ifrs and the changeover date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are engaged in the acquisition of gold projects and related activities including exploration engineering  permitting and the preparation of feasibility studies 
the value of our properties is related to gold price and changes in the price of gold could affect our ability to generate revenue from our portfolio of gold projects 
gold prices may fluctuate widely from time to time and are affected by numerous factors  including the following expectations with respect to the rate of inflation  exchange rates  interest rates  global and regional political and economic circumstances and governmental policies  including those with respect to gold holdings by central banks 
the demand for  and supply of gold affect gold prices  but not necessarily in the same manner as demand and supply affect the prices of other commodities 
the supply of gold consists of a combination of new mine production and existing stocks of bullion and fabricated gold held by governments  public and private financial institutions  industrial organizations and private individuals 
the demand for gold primarily consists of jewelry and investments 
additionally  hedging activities by producers  consumers  financial institutions and individuals can affect gold supply and demand 
while gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world  its market value cannot be predicted for any particular time 
because we have several exploration operations in north america  australia and in asia  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not engage in currency hedging to offset any risk of currency fluctuations as insignificant monetary amounts are held for immaterial land holding costs related to the properties owned 
on march   we announced the closing of a private placement in which we offered and sold million in aggregate principal amount of secured senior convertible notes 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum calculated and payable semi annually in arrears and will mature on march  we do not consider our interest rate risk exposure to be significant at this time 
see item business significant developments in brokered private placement of convertible notes
