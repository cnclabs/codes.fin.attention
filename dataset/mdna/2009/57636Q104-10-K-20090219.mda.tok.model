table of contents impact of foreign currency rates our overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  especially the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real 
the functional currency of mastercard europe  our principal european operating subsidiary  is the euro  and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real 
accordingly  the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries operating results into the us dollar 
during  and  the us dollar weakened against the euro and brazilian real  which increased revenues and expenses 
more recently  the us dollar has begun to strengthen against the euro and brazilian real and if this trend continues  revenues and expenses will decrease 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume gdv and gross euro volume gev  which are used in the calculation of our assessment revenues 
in most non european regions  gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period 
in europe  gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period 
as a result  our assessment revenues are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus most non european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus european local currencies

business environment challenges we process transactions from approximately countries and territories and in more than currencies 
the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business 
the united states is our largest geographic market based on revenues 
revenue generated in the united states was approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
no individual country  other than the united states  generated more than of total revenues in any period 
however  revenues generated from certain non us countries have grown faster than united states revenues due to differences in market maturity  economic health  price changes and foreign exchange fluctuations in those countries 
while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries  the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states 
during  unprecedented events occurred in the financial markets around the world  resulting in distress in the credit environment  equity market volatility and government intervention 
in particular  the economies of the united states and the united kingdom were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil  however it also impacted other economies around the world 
some existing customers have gone bankrupt or have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by the government 
many of our financial institution customers  merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted 
as a result  our operating results have begun to be impacted  or could be negatively impacted  in several ways  including but not limited to the following our customers may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate increasing cardholder defaults 
constriction of consumer and business confidence may cause decreased spending 
declining economies can change consumer spending behaviors  for example  a significant portion of our revenues is dependent on international travel patterns  which may decline 
mergers of our customers may lower our pricing due to the tiered pricing structure of most customer agreements  which typically offer lower pricing as higher business volumes are achieved 

table of contents consolidation of our customers can increase the bargaining power of our customers during new and renewal contract negotiations 
uncertainty and volatility in our customers businesses makes our estimates of revenues  rebates and incentives more difficult 
as such  certain prepayments under customer business agreements may not be realizable 
our customers may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives 
decreased spending by our customers for optional or enhanced services 
government intervention and or investments in our customers may lead to the nationalization of those banking institutions or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products 
tightening of credit availability could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility 
see liquidity for additional discussion of this committed  unsecured  revolving credit facility 
our customers may default on their settlement obligations 
see note settlement and travelers cheque risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion of our settlement exposure 
in addition  our business is subject to regulation in many countries 
regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry 
for example  see note legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of global interchange proceedings 
revenues we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment related services operations fees and by charging assessments to our customers based on the gdv of activity on the cards that carry our brands assessments 
gdv includes the aggregated dollar amount of usage purchases  cash disbursements  balance transfers and convenience checks on mastercard branded cards 
our pricing for transactions and services is complex 
each category of revenue has numerous fee components depending on the types of transactions or services provided 
we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis and expect pricing to continue to be a component of revenue growth in the future 
in addition  standard pricing varies among our regional businesses  and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements 
our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers 
operations fees are transaction based and are also volume based and are charged for facilitating the processing and acceptance of payment transactions and information management among our customers 
mastercard s system for transaction processing involves four participants in addition to us issuers the cardholders banks  acquirers the merchants banks  merchants and cardholders 
operations fees are charged to issuers  acquirers or their delegated processors for transaction processing services  specific programs to promote mastercard branded card acceptance and additional services to assist our customers in managing their businesses 
the significant components of operations fees are as follows authorization occurs when a merchant requests approval for a cardholder s transaction 
we charge a fee for routing the authorization for approval to and from the issuer or  in certain circumstances  such as when the issuer s systems are unavailable  for approval by us or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuer s instructions 
our rules  which vary across regions  establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions 
these fees are primarily paid by issuers 
settlement refers to the process in which we determine the amounts due between issuers and acquirers for payment transactions and associated fees 
first  we clear a transaction by transferring the financial 
table of contents transaction details among issuers  acquirers or their designated third party processors 
then we settle or exchange the related funds among the issuers and acquirers 
we charge a fee for these settlement and clearing services 
these fees are primarily paid by issuers 
switch fees are charges for the use of the mastercard debit switch the mds 
the mds transmits financial messages between acquirers and issuers and provides transaction and statistical reporting and performs settlement between customers and other debit transaction processing networks 
these fees are primarily paid by issuers 
currency conversion and cross border are volume based revenues 
cross border volumes are generated by transactions in which the cardholder and merchant geography are different 
we process transactions denominated in more than currencies through our global system  providing cardholders with the ability to utilize  and merchants to accept  mastercard cards across multiple country borders 
we charge issuers and acquirers for all cross border volumes 
we can also perform currency conversion services by processing transactions in a merchant s local currency and converting the amount to the currency of the issuer  who in turn may add foreign exchange charges and post the transaction on the cardholder s statement in their own home currency 
we charge issuers for performing currency conversion 
acceptance development fees are charged to issuers based on components of gdv and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale 
these fees are primarily us based 
warning bulletin fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants 
connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access  equipment  and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages 
these fees are based on the volume of information being transmitted through and the number of connections to our systems 
consulting and research fees are primarily generated by mastercard advisors  our professional advisory services group 
we provide a wide range of consulting and research services associated with our customers payment activities and programs 
research includes revenues from subscription based services  access to research inquiry  and peer networking services generated by our independent financial and payments industry research group 
we do not anticipate consulting and research fees becoming a significant percentage of our business 
other operations fees represent various revenue streams  including cardholder services  a variety of account and transaction enhancement services  fees for us acquirers accepting transactions from cardholders with non us issuers  compliance and penalty fees  holograms and publications 
cardholder services are benefits provided with mastercard branded cards  such as insurance  telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating automated teller machines 
assessment fees are primarily based on a customer s gdv for a specific time period and the rates vary depending on the region and nature of the transactions that generate gdv 
assessments that are based on quarterly gdv are estimated utilizing aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance 
from time to time  the company may introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs 
our gross revenues from operations fees and assessments vary and are dependent on the nature of the transactions and gdv generated from those transactions 
the combination of the following transaction characteristics for operations and or assessment fees determines the pricing domestic or cross border credit  online debit pin based  offline debit signature based tiered pricing with rates decreasing as customers meet incremental volume transaction hurdles 
table of contents geographic region or country retail purchase or cash withdrawal we process most of the cross border transactions using mastercard  maestro and cirrus branded cards and process the majority of mastercard branded domestic transactions in the united states  united kingdom  canada  brazil and australia 
cross border transactions generate greater revenue than domestic transactions due to higher operations fees for settlement  authorization and switch  and are also subject to cross border and currency conversion fees 
in addition  higher operations fees are charged on signature transactions than online transactions 
in and  gross revenues grew and  respectively 
revenue growth was the result of increased transactions and gdv  as well as price increases and currency fluctuation 
our overall revenue growth is being moderated by the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives 
accordingly  we have entered into business agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide gdv and other performance based support incentives 
the rebates and incentives are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements 
rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs 
the continued consolidation of our customers and the growing influence of merchants have led to enhanced competition in the global payments industry and demand for better pricing arrangements 
our revenue growth was moderated by a million  or  and a million  or  increase in rebates and incentives to our customers and merchants in and  respectively 
a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers 
in  the net revenues from these customers were approximately billion  or  of total net revenue 
the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenues and net income 
see risk factors business risks consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may result in lower prices and or more favorable terms for our customers  which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in item a of this report 
in addition  as part of our business strategy  mastercard  among other efforts  enters into business agreements with customers 
these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances 
see risk factors business risks we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers  which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in item a of this report

currency conversion and cross border revenues increased primarily due to increases in cross border volumes of and in and  respectively

prior period volume growth rates have been restated to be consistent with the revised methodology 
in addition to the increase in cross border volumes in and  price increases have contributed to our revenue growth 
price increases on acquiring cross border volumes implemented in january and october accounted for approximately percentage points of the percentage increase in also  a restructuring of our currency conversion pricing in accounted for approximately percentage points of the percentage increase in acceptance development fees increased in and primarily due to increased volumes and the introduction of a new fee in april the new fee accounted for approximately and percentage points of the percentage increases in and  respectively

the resulting tax benefit of the loss was offset by a tax charge for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of a change in the company s state effective tax rate 
as a result of the remeasurement  the company s deferred tax assets were reduced by million and an income tax expense was recorded for the same amount 
the change in the effective income tax rate in compared to primarily relates to a non deductible charitable contribution of shares of mastercard class a common stock to the foundation during mastercard recorded a significant expense equal to the value of the class a common stock we donated to the foundation 
under the terms of the contribution to the foundation  this donation is generally not deductible to mastercard for tax purposes 
the components impacting the effective income tax rates as compared to the us federal statutory tax rate of are as follows for the years ended december  dollar amount percent dollar amount percent dollar amount percent in millions  except percentages income loss before income tax expense benefit federal statutory tax state tax effect  net of federal benefit non deductible charitable stock contribution foreign tax effect  net of federal benefit non deductible expenses and other differences tax exempt income income tax expense benefit

the company s effective tax rate for was significantly affected by the million charitable contribution of mastercard class a common stock to the foundation 
due to the non recurring nature of these items  the company believes that the calculation of the effective tax rate  excluding the impacts of the discover settlement and american express settlement  and the effective tax rate  excluding the impact of the charitable stock contribution to the foundation  will be helpful in comparing effective tax rates for  and gaap effective tax rate calculation in millions  except percentages income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss effective tax rate non gaap effective tax rate calculation in millions  except percentages gaap income loss before income taxes litigation settlements stock donation to the mastercard foundation non gaap income before income taxes income tax expense benefit impact of litigation settlements on income tax expense benefit non gaap income tax expense non gaap net income non gaap effective tax rate the stock contribution to the mastercard foundation was a permanently non deductible item and therefore has no impact on the calculation of non gaap income tax expense 
the litigation settlements will be deductible in future periods as payments are made and are therefore considered in the calculation of non gaap income tax expense

substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 

table of contents some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property

our debt obligations would change if one or more of our members failed and we borrowed under these credit facilities to settle on our members behalf or for other reasons 
seasonality our revenues are contingent upon the underlying metrics on which the revenues are calculated 
gross revenues in the fourth quarter of were negatively impacted by lower purchase volumes and transactions due to the economic crisis 
in response  mastercard accelerated its cost savings initiatives in the quarter  with particular focus on advertising  personnel and travel expenses 
historically  during the fourth quarter  our quarterly gross revenues have been positively impacted by increases in purchase volume related to the holiday shopping period  with offsetting increases resulting from higher rebates and incentives to our customers 
also  operating expenses have historically been higher in the fourth quarter due to additional advertising and promotions related to the holiday period and increases in personnel incentives for exceeding the company s objectives 
the economic environment in caused our operating results to diverge from these historical trends 

table of contents critical accounting estimates our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments 
financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions asset impairment analyses investments the company invests in certain short term and long term assets  including municipal bonds  bond funds and ars 
the company s investment strategy for these assets is to ensure capital preservation while capturing some interest return on the invested funds 
the company performs on going evaluations of its investments to assess potential impairment 
impairment of the company s investments in municipal bonds is assessed based on market prices of similar assets  as provided by custodians of such assets 
impairment of the company s short term bond funds is assessed based on quoted prices for these assets  as they are actively traded on a daily basis 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to additional impairment charges associated with our investments 
the fair value of our available for sale investment portfolio was million as of december   which included million of net unrealized losses 
the primary analysis tool used to assess impairment of the company s ars investments is a discounted cash flow model 
this model considers the original economic life of the asset  the relevant cash flows expected over the life of the asset  an appropriate discount rate and other factors that may be relevant 
the present value of the expected future cash flows is calculated and compared to the carrying value to determine if an impairment has occurred and  if so  what is the expected duration of the impairment 
prepaid customer and merchant incentives we prepay certain customer and merchant business incentives to incent usage and acceptance of our cards 
in the event of customer or merchant business failure  these incentives may not have future economic benefits for our business 
the evaluation of recoverability of prepaid customer and merchant incentives is done whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if events or changes in circumstances occur that we are not aware of  additional impairment charges related to our prepaid customer and merchant incentives may be incurred 
the carrying value of prepaid customer and merchant incentives was at december  
table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill and intangible assets excluding capitalized software we perform analyses of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist 
this evaluation utilizes a two step approach 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over fair value 
the test methods employed in performing the analyses involve assumptions concerning interest and discount rates  growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions 
the assumptions employed are based on management s judgment using internal and external data 
we utilize independent valuation experts  if needed 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge associated with goodwill and or intangible assets 
the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets  excluding capitalized software  was million  including million of unamortizable customer relationships  as of december  we determined that the majority of our customer relationships  which are intangible assets  have indefinite lives 
in addition to the impairment testing noted above  we assess the appropriateness of that indefinite life annually 
we completed our annual impairment testing for all goodwill and other intangibles using the methodology described herein  and no impairment charges were recorded for the year ended december  capitalized software our capitalized software  which includes internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use  is included in other intangible assets 
we are required to make judgments to determine if each project will satisfy its intended use 
in addition  we estimate the average internal costs incurred for payroll and payroll related expenses by department for the employees who directly devote time relating to the design  development and testing phases of the project 
if actual results are not consistent with our judgments  we may be exposed to an impairment charge 
the net carrying value of capitalized software as of december  was million 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate whether there are any events that indicate impairment of our various technologies 
during the year ended december   no significant impairment charges were recorded 
revenue recognition our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly gdv or gev are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers performance 
total net assessment revenues included an estimate as of the end of the period for  and of those net our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly gdv or gev are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers performance 
such estimates are subsequently validated against performance reported by our customers 
if our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance  revenues may be materially different than initially recorded 
historically  our estimates have differed from the actual 
table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions assessment revenues  representing  and of total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our revenue recognition policies are fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports 
customers performance is estimated by using historical performance  customer reported information  transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers 
performance by less than of the estimates on a quarterly basis 
rebates and incentives are estimated 
rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra revenue based on our estimate of each customer s performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements 
if our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance  contra revenues may be materially different than initially recorded 
legal and regulatory matters legal proceedings we are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters 
except as described in notes obligations under litigation settlements and legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  mastercard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects 
we evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings  the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes 
discount rates for litigation settlements we have discounted two litigation settlements over their respective payment terms 
the us merchant lawsuit settlement was discounted at over the ten year payment term 
we estimated the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligations under litigation settlements 
the discount rate is a matter of management judgment at the time of each settlement  which considers our expected post settlement credit rating and rates for sources of credit that could be used to finance the payment of such obligations with similar terms 
for the us merchant lawsuit settlement  a one percent increase in the discount rate would have increased annual interest expense in by approximately million  and declining amounts thereafter 
the reverse impact would be experienced for a one percent decrease in such discount rate 

table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions the american express settlement was discounted at over the three year payment term 
for the american express settlement  a one percent increase in the discount rate would have decreased the litigation settlement expense for by approximately million 
a one percent decrease in the discount rate would produce the opposite impact 
for the american express settlement  a one percent increase in the discount rate would have increased interest expense for by approximately million 
a one percent decrease in the discount rate would produce the opposite impact 
income taxes in calculating our effective tax rate  we need to make decisions regarding certain tax positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we have various tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions  establishment of reserves for credits and audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results may differ by a material amount 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we realize a deferred tax asset subject to a valuation allowance in excess of the deferred tax asset net of that valuation allowance or if we were unable to realize such a net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase or decrease earnings  respectively  in the period 
we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns that may not be sustained or would only partially be sustained  upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
we considered all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether an uncertain tax position was more likely than not to be sustained 
if upon examination  we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained this would decrease or increase earnings  in the period 
in certain situations  the company will have offsetting tax deductions or tax credits 
we do not record us income tax expense for foreign earnings which we plan to reinvest to expand our international operations 
we considered business plans  planning opportunities  and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations 
if our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations  additional us income tax expense would have to be recorded which would increase our effective tax rate in that period 

table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions pensions and postretirement benefit plans the company maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan with a cash balance feature covering substantially all of its us employees hired before july  this pension plan credits participants annually with an amount equal to a fixed percentage of eligible pay based on age and service  as well as providing earnings credits based on each participant s account balance 
additionally  the company has an unfunded nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan that provides certain key employees with supplemental retirement benefits in excess of limits imposed on qualified plans by us tax laws 
the company also maintains a postretirement plan providing health coverage and life insurance benefits for most of its us employees and retirees 
company management representing the functional areas of compensation  benefits  treasury and finance review and approve on an annual basis assumptions used in the determination of the annual costs for our pension and postretirement plans and the disclosure of the funded position of our plans 
key assumptions include the discount rate used to measure each of the plans projected benefit obligations for pension and postretirement  the expected rate of return on pension plan assets and the health care cost trend rate for our postretirement plan 
the discount rates for the company s pension and postretirement plans are subject to change each year  consistent with changes in high quality  long term corporate bond markets 
to select a discount rate for each plan  we performed an analysis which matched the plans expected cash flows determined on pbo basis with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of high grade non callable corporate bonds and arithmetically rounded this result 
for the pension plan  our discount rate of as of december  is equal to the rate used in calculating the projected benefit obligation for for the postretirement plan  our discount rate of as of december  is basis points less than the rate used in calculating the projected benefit obligation for net actuarial gains and or losses in our benefit plans are amortized on straight line basis over the expected average remaining service of active participants expected to benefit under the plans 
we determine the expected return on plan assets primarily based on long term historical returns in equity and fixed income markets 
the expected rate of return on our pension plan assets is for the year ended december  and for the years ended december  and the company reviews external data and its own historical trends to determine the health care trend rates for postretirement medical costs 
a quarter of a percentage point decrease in our discount rate would increase our pension projected benefit obligation by million  and increase our postretirement projected benefit obligation by million 
these decreases would have a negligible effect on our annual pension and postretirement expense 
an approximately equal  but opposite effect would be experienced for a quarter of a percentage point increase in the discount rate 
a quarter of a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase the annual pension costs by million 

table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions postemployment benefit plan we have a formal severance plan which sets forth the guidelines with respect to severance payments to salaried employees whose normal assignment is within the united states 
approximately  of our employees are covered by the plan 
severance benefits are determined primarily by years of service and career level in accordance with either a standard or enhanced payment schedule  which is determined by the cause of the severance action 
the company has a severance plan committee with members from different functional responsibilities  including human resources  legal and finance  that review and approve assumptions used in the determination of the liability for expected future severance obligations 
key assumptions include the number of severed participants  number of severed individuals by career level  benefit package and discount rate 
the assumption for the number of severed participants used in the calculation was  and for  and  respectively 
the career levels for these individuals was estimated using historical experience as a base  adjusted for a number of strategic and human resource initiatives implemented during these years and current employment levels 
we review historical trends and future expectations when determining the assumptions 
the discount rate for our postemployment plan is subject to change each year  consistent with changes in high quality  long term corporate bond markets 
to select a discount rate  we performed an analysis which matched the plans expected cash flows with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of high grade non callable corporate bonds and arithmetically rounded this result 
our discount rate of as of december  is basis points higher than the rate used in calculating the severance obligations for  which was 
a increase in the number of severed participants would increase our severance obligations by million 
an equal but opposite effect would be experienced for a decrease in the number of participants 
a quarter of a percentage point decrease or increase in our discount rate would have an impact of approximately million on our severance obligations
