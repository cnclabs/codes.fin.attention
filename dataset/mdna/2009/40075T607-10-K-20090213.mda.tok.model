item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through traditional deposits  brokered deposits  borrowings  the sale of securities or loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or the terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets 
we rely on commercial and retail deposits  brokered deposits  advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb of topeka and other borrowings to fund our operations 
although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary  we might not be able to 
table of contents replace such funds in the future if  among other things  our results of operations or financial condition or the results of operations or financial condition of the fhlb of topeka or market conditions were to change 
in addition  if we fall below the fdic s thresholds to be considered well capitalized  we will be unable to continue with uninterrupted access to the brokered funds markets 
although we consider these sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs  there can be no assurance in this regard and we may be compelled to seek additional sources of financing in the future 
likewise  we may seek additional debt in the future to achieve our business objectives  in connection with future acquisitions or for other reasons 
there can be no assurance additional borrowings  if sought  would be available to us or  if available  would be on favorable terms 
bank and holding company stock prices have been negatively affected by the recent adverse economic trend  as has the ability of banks and holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years 
if additional financing sources are unavailable or not available on reasonable terms  our financial condition  results of operations and future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
we actively monitor the depository institutions that hold our federal funds sold and due from banks cash balances 
we are currently not able to provide assurances that access to our cash equivalents and federal funds sold will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and we diversify our due from banks and federal funds sold among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 
the financials of the counterparties are routinely reviewed as part of our asset liability management process 
balances in our accounts with financial institutions in the us may exceed the fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor and adjust the balances in our accounts as appropriate  these balances could be impacted if the financial institutions fail and could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
concern of customers over deposit insurance may cause a decrease in deposits with recent increased concerns about bank failures  customers increasingly are concerned about the extent to which their deposits are insured by the fdic 
customers may withdraw deposits in an effort to ensure that the amount they have on deposit with their bank is fully insured 
decreases in deposits may adversely affect our funding costs and net income 
our deposit insurance premium could be substantially higher in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured financial institutions  including the bank 
the fdic charges the insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund at a certain level 
current economic conditions have increased bank failures and expectations for further failures  in which case the fdic ensures payments of deposits up to insured limits from the deposit insurance fund 
on october   the fdic published a restoration plan designed to replenish the deposit insurance fund over a period of five years and to increase the deposit insurance reserve ratio  which decreased to of insured deposits on june   to the statutory minimum of of insured deposits by december  in order to implement the restoration plan  the fdic proposes to change both its risk based assessment system and its base assessment rates 
for the first quarter of only  the fdic increased all fdic deposit assessment rates by basis points 
these new rates range from basis points for risk category i institutions to basis points for risk category iv institutions 
under the fdic s restoration plan  the fdic proposes to establish new initial base assessment rates that will be subject to adjustment as described below 
beginning april   the base assessment rates would range from basis points for risk category i institutions to basis points for risk category iv institutions 
changes to the risk based assessment system would include increasing premiums for institutions that rely on excessive amounts of brokered deposits  including 
table of contents cdars  increasing premiums for excessive use of secured liabilities  including federal home loan bank advances  lowering premiums for smaller institutions with very high capital levels  and adding financial ratios and debt issuer ratings to the premium calculations for banks with over billion in assets  while providing a reduction for their unsecured debt 
either an increase in the risk category of the bank or adjustments to the base assessment rates could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
we may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future  but capital may not be available when it is needed we are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
in addition  we may elect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions  if any  or we may otherwise elect to raise additional capital 
in that regard  a number of financial institutions have recently raised considerable amounts of capital as a result of deterioration in their results of operations and financial condition arising from the turmoil in the mortgage loan market  deteriorating economic conditions  declines in real estate values and other factors  which may diminish our ability to raise additional capital 
on october   congress approved the billion emergency economic stabilization act of eesa 
the first phase of implementation of eesa included a billion treasury capital purchase program 
the company applied for up to three percent of its total risk weighted assets in capital  which would be in the form of non cumulative perpetual preferred stock of the institution with a dividend rate of until the fifth anniversary of the investment  and thereafter 
if the company s application is approved and the investment is completed  treasury will also receive warrants for common stock of the company equal to of the capital invested 
there is no guarantee that the treasury will select the company to participate in its capital purchase program 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets  economic conditions and a number of other factors  many of which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot be assured of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
the value of securities in our investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by continued disruptions in securities markets the market for some of the investment securities held in our portfolio has become extremely volatile over the past twelve months 
volatile market conditions may detrimentally affect the value of these securities  such as through reduced valuations due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks 
there can be no assurance that the declines in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in other than temporary impairments of these assets  which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us since mid  the financial services industry as a whole  as well as the securities markets generally  have been materially and adversely affected by very significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a very serious lack of liquidity 
financial institutions in particular have been subject to increased volatility and an overall loss in investor confidence 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial 
table of contents services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other institutional clients 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services companies  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination 
any change in the laws or regulations applicable to us  or in banking regulators supervisory policies or examination procedures  whether by the colorado division of banking  the fdic  the federal reserve board  other state or federal regulators  the us congress or the colorado legislature could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the bank is subject to regulations promulgated by the colorado division of banking  as its chartering authority  and by the fdic as the insurer of its deposits up to certain limits 
the bank also belongs to the federal home loan bank system and  as a member  it is subject to certain limited regulations promulgated by the federal home loan bank of topeka 
in addition  the federal reserve board regulates and oversees guaranty bancorp as a bank holding company  and the bank  as a member of the federal reserve system 
this regulation and supervision limits the activities in which we may engage 
the purpose of regulation and supervision is primarily to protect the fdic s insurance fund and our depositors and borrowers  rather than our stockholders 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in the exercise of their supervisory and enforcement powers 
they may  among other things  impose restrictions on the operation of a banking institution  the classification of assets by such institution and such institution s allowance for loan losses 
regulatory and law enforcement authorities also have wide discretion and extensive enforcement powers under various consumer protection and civil rights laws  including the truth in lending act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the red flag identity theft rules under the fair and accurate credit transactions act and colorado s deceptive acts and practices law 
these laws also permit private individual and class action lawsuits and provide for the recovery of attorneys fees in certain instances 
given the current disruption in the financial markets and regulatory initiatives that are likely to be proposed by the new administration and congress  new regulations and laws that may affect us are increasingly likely 
compliance with such regulations and laws may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
also  participation in specific government stabilization programs may subject us to additional restrictions 
no assurance can be given that the foregoing regulations and supervision will not change so as to affect us adversely 
there can be no assurance that the recently enacted emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa and other recently enacted government programs will help stabilize the us financial system on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was enacted 
the us treasury and banking regulators are implementing a number of programs under this legislation and otherwise to address capital and liquidity issues in the banking system  including the tarp capital purchase program 
in addition  other regulators have taken steps to attempt to stabilize and add liquidity to the financial markets  such as the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program tlg program  which we did not opt out of 
however  there can be no assurance that we will 
table of contents issue any guaranteed debt under the tlg program  or that we will participate in any other stabilization programs in the future 
there can also be no assurance as to the actual impact that the eesa and other programs will have on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced 
the failure of the eesa and other programs to stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the trading price of our common stock 
the eesa is relatively new legislation and  as such  is subject to change and evolving interpretation 
this is particularly true given the change in administration that occurred on january  there can be no assurances as to the effects that such changes will have on the effectiveness of the eesa or on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the colorado front range our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the counties in which we conduct business 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the colorado front range  which includes the denver metropolitan area 
the local economic conditions in our market area have a significant impact on our loans  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation  natural disasters  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond our control would affect these local economic conditions and could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
further deterioration in economic conditions  in particular within our primary market areas  could result in the following consequences  among others  any of which could hurt our business materially loan delinquencies on real estate  commercial and consumer loans may increase  problem assets and foreclosures may increase  demand for our products and services may decline  and collateral for loans made by us  especially real estate  may decline in value  in turn reducing a customer s borrowing power and reducing the value of assets and collateral securing our loans 
in view of the concentration of our operations and the collateral securing our loan portfolio in colorado s front range  we may be particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of any of these consequences  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the various markets we serve 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
additionally  we expect competition to intensify among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic funds transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a 
table of contents result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets 
the ability to expand our market position 
the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands 
the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors 
customer satisfaction with our level of service 
industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we rely on dividends from our subsidiary for most of our revenue because we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the bank  we currently depend upon dividends from the bank for a substantial portion of our revenues 
our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders will therefore continue to depend in large part upon our receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from the bank 
our ability to pay dividends is subject to the restrictions of the delaware general corporation law 
the ability of the bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions to the holding company is also subject to the regulatory authority of the federal reserve board and the colorado division of banking cdb 
because of the accumulated deficit resulting from goodwill impairment charges in and  the bank will be required to obtain permission from the federal reserve board and the cdb prior to making any dividend to the holding company  as further described in the supervision and regulation section of item of this report 
during  the bank requested and received permission to pay million in dividends from the bank to the holding company 
from time to time  we may become a party to financing agreements or other contractual arrangements that have the effect of limiting or prohibiting us or our bank subsidiary from declaring or paying dividends 
our holding company expenses and interest obligations on our trust preferred securities and corresponding subordinated debt securities issued by us may limit or impair our ability to declare or pay dividends 
the holding company currently has approximately million in cash on hand  which based on current projections  is sufficient to meet our short term cash needs 
if we are unable to obtain permission to pay dividends from the bank to the holding company  or are unable to raise additional capital  it could cause us to elect to defer interest payments on the trust preferred securities and corresponding subordinated debt securities for up to quarters 
see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities dividends for more information on these restrictions 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could harm our business competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in the colorado community banking industry 
the process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and 
table of contents attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy 
our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  loan origination  administrative  marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of our management and personnel 
in particular  our success is highly dependent upon the abilities of our senior executive management 
we believe this management team  comprised of individuals who have worked in the banking industry for many years  is integral to implementing our business plan 
the loss of the services of one or more of them could harm our business 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we are subject to security and operational risks relating to our use of technology that could damage our reputation and our business 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
additionally  we outsource our data processing to a third party 
if our third party provider encounters difficulties or if we have difficulty in communicating with such third party  it will significantly affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions  which would significantly affect our business operations 
furthermore  breaches of such third party s technology may also cause reimbursable loss to our consumer and business customers  through no fault of our own 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of information systems used to process customer transactions could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we continually encounter technological change the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility from time to time  customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities 
whether customer claims and legal action related to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded  if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us  they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for our products and services 
any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
concentrated ownership of our common stock creates a risk of sudden changes in our share price as of february   executive officers  directors and stockholders of more than of our common stock owned or controlled approximately of our common stock 
investors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock 
the sale by any of our large stockholders of a significant portion of that stockholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we face risks associated with acquisitions or mergers we may pursue acquisition or merger opportunities in the future 
risks commonly encountered in merger and acquisitions include  among other things the difficulty of integrating the operations  systems and personnel of acquired companies and branches 
the potential disruption of our ongoing business 
the potential diversion of our management s time and attention 
the inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position by the successful implementation of uniform product offerings and the incorporation of uniform technology into our product offerings and control systems 
the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management 
the potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired or merged company 
exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired or merged company 
the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired or merged company 
difficulty in estimating the value of the acquired or merged company 
potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the acquired or merged company 
environmental liability with acquired loans  and their collateral  or with any real estate 
we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with mergers or acquisitions 
our integration of operations of banks or branches that we acquire may not be successfully accomplished and may take a significant amount of time 
our inability to improve the operating performance of acquired banks and branches or to integrate successfully or in a timely manner their operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we expect to hire additional employees and retain 
table of contents consultants to assist with integrating our operations  and we cannot assure you that those individuals or firms will perform as expected or be successful in addressing these issues 
we are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title in the course of our business  we may own or foreclose and take title to real estate  and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site  we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities  our business  financial condition  cash flows  liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause us to incur additional expenses 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

item legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business  we are party to various legal actions  which we believe are incidental to the operation of our business 
although the ultimate outcome and amount of liability  if any  with respect to these legal actions to which we are currently a party cannot presently be ascertained with certainty  in the opinion of management  based upon information currently available to us  any resulting liability is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

our board of directors will take into account such matters as general business conditions  our financial results  capital requirements  contractual  legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our bank subsidiary to the holding company  and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant 
our ability to pay dividends is subject to the restrictions of the delaware general corporation law 
because we are a holding company with no significant assets other than our bank subsidiary  we currently depend upon dividends from our bank subsidiary for a substantial portion of our revenues 
our ability to pay dividends will therefore continue to depend in large part upon our receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from our bank subsidiary 
see supervision and regulation in item of this report for a discussion of potential regulatory limitations on the holding company s receipt of funds from its bank subsidiary 
the ability of our bank subsidiary to pay dividends or make other capital distributions to us is also subject to the regulatory authority of the federal reserve board and the colorado division of banking  or the cdb 
it is possible  depending upon the financial condition of the bank  and other factors  that the federal reserve board and or the cdb could assert that payment of dividends or other payments is an unsafe or unsound practice

overview we are a bank holding company providing banking and other financial services throughout our targeted colorado markets to consumers and to small and medium sized businesses  including the owners and employees of those businesses 
we offer an array of banking products and services to the communities we serve  including accepting time and demand deposits and originating commercial loans including energy loans  real estate loans  small business administration guaranteed loans and consumer loans 
we derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related loans  commercial loans and leases and consumer loans and  to a lesser extent  interest on investment securities  fees received in connection with servicing loan and deposit accounts and fees from trust services 
our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses 
we rely primarily on locally generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans 
we are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results  like those of other financial institutions operating exclusively or primarily in colorado  are significantly influenced by economic conditions in colorado  including the strength of the real estate market 
in addition  both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and consistently applied from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies that we believe are critical or involve significant management judgment 
allowance for loan losses the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet 
we determine probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio and establish an allowance for those losses by considering factors including historical loss rates  expected cash flows and estimated collateral values 
in assessing these factors  we use organizational history and experience with credit decisions and related outcomes 
the allowance for loan losses represents our best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
we evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly 
if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate based on subsequent loss evaluations  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted 
we estimate the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses by separately evaluating impaired and nonimpaired loans 
a specific allowance is assigned to an impaired loan when expected cash flows or collateral do not justify the carrying amount of the loan 
the methodology used to assign an allowance to a nonimpaired loan is more subjective 
generally  the allowance assigned to nonimpaired loans is determined by applying historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics  adjusted for qualitative factors including the volume and severity of identified classified loans  changes in economic conditions  changes in credit policies or underwriting standards  and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets 
because the economic and business climate in any given industry or market  and its impact on any given borrower  can change rapidly  the risk profile of the loan portfolio is continually assessed and adjusted when appropriate 
notwithstanding these procedures  there still exists the possibility that our assessment could prove to be significantly incorrect and that an immediate adjustment to the allowance for loan losses would be required 
we estimate the appropriate level of loan loss allowance by conducting a detailed review of a number of smaller portfolio segments that comprise our loan portfolios 
we segment the loan portfolio 
table of contents into as many components as practical 
each component would normally have similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving  while the risk profile of others may be deteriorating 
as a result  changes in the appropriate level of the allowance for different segments may offset one another 
adjustments to the allowance represent the aggregate impact from the analysis of all loan segments 
other real estate owned and foreclosed assets other real estate owned or other foreclosed assets acquired through loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired  establishing a new cost basis 
the adjustment at the time of foreclosure is recorded through the allowance for loan losses 
due to the subjective nature of establishing the fair value when the asset is acquired  the actual fair value of the other real estate owned or foreclosed asset could differ from the original estimate 
if it is determined that fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure  a valuation allowance is recorded through noninterest expense 
operating costs associated with the assets after acquisition are also recorded as noninterest expense 
gains and losses on the disposition of other real estate owned and foreclosed assets are netted and posted to other noninterest income 
investment in debt and equity securities we classify our investments in debt and equity securities as either held to maturity or available for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
securities classified as held to maturity are recorded at cost or amortized cost 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value 
fair value calculations are based on quoted market prices when such prices are available 
if quoted market prices are not available  estimates of fair value are computed using a variety of techniques  including extrapolation from the quoted prices of similar instruments or recent trades for thinly traded securities  fundamental analysis  or through obtaining purchase quotes 
due to the subjective nature of the valuation process  it is possible that the actual fair values of these investments could differ from the estimated amounts  thereby affecting our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if the estimated value of investments is less than the cost or amortized cost  we evaluate whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
if such an event or change has occurred and we determine that the impairment is other than temporary  we expense the impairment of the investment in the period in which the event or change occurred 
deferred income tax assets liabilities our net deferred income tax asset arises from differences in the dates that items of income and expense enter into our reported income and taxable income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for these items as they arise 
from an accounting standpoint  deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they are realizable based on the historical level of our taxable income  estimates of our future taxable income and the reversals of deferred tax liabilities 
in most cases  the realization of the deferred tax asset is based on our future profitability 
if we were to experience net operating losses for tax purposes in a future period  the realization of our deferred tax assets would be evaluated for a potential valuation reserve 
although we had a loss for financial reporting purposes in and  for income tax purposes the company reported taxable income and paid federal and state income tax 
additionally  the company reviews its uncertain tax positions annually under fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
an uncertain tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination  with a tax examination being presumed to occur 
the amount actually recognized is the largest amount of tax 
table of contents benefit that is greater than likely to be recognized on examination 
for tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test  no tax benefit is recorded 
a significant amount of judgment is applied to determine both whether the tax position meets the more likely than not test as well as to determine the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely to be recognized 
differences between the position taken by management and that of taxing authorities could result in a reduction of a tax benefit or increase to tax liability  which could adversely affect future income tax expense 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets core deposit and customer relationships  which are intangible assets with a finite life  are recorded on our balance sheets 
these intangible assets were capitalized as a result of past acquisitions and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to years 
core deposit intangible assets  with finite lives will be tested for impairment when changes in events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
core deposits were tested for impairment during and  as part of the goodwill impairment test and no impairment was deemed necessary 
as a result of our acquisition activity  goodwill  an intangible asset with an indefinite life  was reflected on our balance sheet in prior periods 
goodwill was evaluated for impairment annually  unless there were factors present that indicated a potential impairment  in which case  the goodwill impairment test was performed more frequently than annually 
this discussion has highlighted those accounting policies that we consider to be critical to our financial reporting process 
however  all the accounting policies are important  and therefore you are encouraged to review each of the policies included in note to notes to consolidated financial statements in
