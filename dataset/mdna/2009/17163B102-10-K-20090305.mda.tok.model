item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this section also contains forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the section of this report titled disclosure regarding forward looking statements 
business and industry overview ciber provides it system integration consulting and other it services primarily to governmental agencies and fortune and middle market companies across most major industries 
from offices located throughout the united states and europe  as well as eastern asia  australia and new zealand  we provide our clients with a broad range of it services  including custom and package software development  maintenance  implementation and integration 
to a lesser extent  we also resell certain it hardware and software products 
our reportable segments are our five primary operating divisions  which are organized internally primarily by the nature of their services  client base and geography 
they consist of our europe division  which includes eastern asia  australia and new zealand  and our four domestic divisions  which consist of commercial  state local government  federal government and enterprise solutions formerly us erp package solutions 
our europe division provides a broad range of it consulting services  including package software implementation  application development  systems integration and support services  with sap related solutions and services accounting for to of europe s total revenue in our commercial  state local government and federal government divisions comprise our us geographically based operations that provide it services and products in custom developed software environments 
these offices report to a division based on their primary client focus category commercial  state local government or federal government  however  they may have clients that fall into another category 
for example  a commercial office may also provide services to a government client 
our india based operations are considered part of our commercial segment 

table of contents our enterprise solutions division primarily provides enterprise software implementation services  including erp and supply chain management software from software vendors such as oracle  sap and lawson for us customers 
we recognize the majority of our services revenue under time and material contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
under fixed price contracts  which currently make up approximately of our services revenue  our revenue is fixed under the contract  while our costs to complete our obligations under the contract are variable 
as a result  our profitability on fixed price contracts can vary significantly and occasionally can even be a loss 
changes in our services revenue is primarily a function of hours worked on revenue generating activities and  to a lesser extent  changes in our average rate per hour and changes in contract mix 
hours worked on revenue producing activities vary with the number of consultants employed and their utilization level 
utilization represents the percentage of time worked on revenue producing engagements divided by the standard hours available ie  hours per week 
our average utilization rates are higher in our commercial  state local government and federal government divisions typically around to as compared to our europe and enterprise solutions divisions typically around to 
with time and materials contracts  higher consultant utilization results in increased revenue  however  with fixed price contracts  it results in higher costs and lower gross profit margins because our revenue is fixed 
we actively manage both our number of consultants and our overall utilization levels 
if we determine we have excess available resources that we cannot place on billable assignments in the near future  we consider reducing those resources 
as a result  during the last three years  most of our consultant turnover has been from involuntary termination of employment 
the hourly rate we charge for our services varies based on the level of the consultant involved  the particular expertise of the consultant and the geographic area 
our typical time and materials hourly rates range from to per hour and  on average  are generally highest in our enterprise solutions division and lowest in our federal government division 
we also have fixed priced projects  as well as engagements whose pricing is based on cost plus or level of efforts 
for such projects  where our revenue is not directly based on hours incurred  our realized rate per hour will vary significantly depending on success or overages on such projects 
in addition  our foreign revenue and costs of revenue  as reported in us dollars  are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs as a percentage of revenue vary by business segment 
close to of our overall sg a expenses are typically for personnel costs for our branch office personnel  which includes our branch management  consulting staff management  sales and recruiting personnel and administrative staff  as well as our corporate office support staff and management personnel 
although these costs are not immediately affected by changes in revenue  there is often a relatively short term correlation between these sg a salary expenses and revenue 
additionally  as we bid on larger and longer projects  the sales cycle and related sales costs have been increasing 
finally  our european sg a costs  like their revenues  are also subject to changes in currency exchange rates 
as a result of the above  we analyze changes in our sg a expenses in terms of the relationship between these costs and revenue expressed as a percentage of revenue rather than total dollars or percentage change in the total dollars 
other revenue includes resale of third party it hardware and software products  sales of proprietary software and commissions on sales of it products 
our sales of it hardware and software generally involve it network infrastructure 
the gross profit margin on consolidated other revenues is typically in the range of to 
this is a blend of low margin hardware sales typically a to gross margin  mid margin software sales typically a to gross margin and higher margin product commissions and proprietary software sales 
depending on the mix of these business activities  gross profit margin on other revenue will fluctuate 
the market demand for ciber s services is heavily dependent on it spending by major corporations  organizations and government entities in the markets and regions that we serve 
the pace of technology change and changes in business requirements and practices of our clients all have a significant impact on the demand for the services that we provide 
impacts of share based compensation share based compensation cost is included as part of our corporate expenses and is recognized in either cost of consulting services or in sg a expenses  as appropriate 
the table below summarizes the amounts recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for share based compensation year ended december  in thousands cost of consulting services selling  general and administrative expense total share based compensation cost before taxes income tax benefit related to share based compensation total share based compensation included in net income 
table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and consolidated our europe division comprised of our total revenues in as compared to in our europe division operates primarily in western europe but also has offices in china  russia  australia and new zealand 
as such these operations transact business in local currencies of the countries in with they operate 
in  approximately of our europe division s revenue is denominated in euro s  approximately is denominated in great britain pounds gbp and the balance comes from a number of other currencies 
changes in the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
for financial reporting purposes  the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates at period end and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period 
in us dollar terms  currency rates were favorable for ciber during the first quarters of during the fourth quarter of  we saw significant declines in foreign exchange rates as compared to the us dollar 
the balance sheet rates at december   declined by for the euro and for the gbp as compared to last year 
this had a significant impact on our reported balance sheet year over year 
despite the significant decline in exchange rates vs 
the us dollar in the fourth quarter  our weighted average exchange rates for the year increased by approximately over  resulting in approximately million of additional revenues in in january and february  our major foreign currency rates continued to be negative in terms of the us dollar showing a weighted average decline of from our average rates in assuming that these foreign currency rates remain at this level throughout  we estimate this would negatively impact our total revenue by approximately million and would also reduce our earnings per share by approximately per quarter in the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data in dollars and expressed as a percentage of revenue year ended december  dollars in thousands  except billing rate consulting services other revenue total revenue gross profit consulting services gross profit other revenue gross profit total sg a expenses operating income net income average hourly billing rate consultant utilization average billable headcount revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december   increased compared to total revenue for the year ended december  we are a global company  therefore  our revenue is denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the us dollar weakened in the first half of and strengthened during the last half of against many currencies  however  overall the us dollar was weaker against many currencies during as compared to  resulting in favorable currency translation and greater reported us dollar revenues in the current year 
foreign currency rate changes resulted in approximately million  or almost  of additional reported revenue in over additionally  small acquisitions completed in both our enterprise solutions and europe divisions contributed incremental revenue of approximately million to the current year results 
excluding the favorable currency translation effects and the incremental revenue from acquisitions  our total revenue for the year ended december   increased from total revenue reported for the year ended december   primarily due to increased sap software related services in europe  as well as increased consulting services revenue in our commercial division 
our results  most notably in the fourth quarter  were adversely affected by the worsening global economic conditions 
during the fourth quarter of  we began to experience client reductions in the use of our services  as well as clients delaying starts on new projects and seeking price reductions 
additionally  billable headcount was down to approximately  at 
table of contents december   as compared to our average billable headcount of  for the fiscal year and compared to  as of december  revenue by segment division was as follows year ended december  change in thousands commercial europe state local government federal government enterprise solutions inter segment n m total revenue n m not meaningful commercial revenue increased in the current year mainly due to several sizable contract wins  additional work on other existing contracts and improved productivity 
unfortunately  we have seen some of this work subsequently cancelled due to the current economic environment  thus  we do not anticipate this level of revenue growth for in the commercial division 
the performance of our europe division during represented its best revenue results to date 
in the current year  europe represented approximately of our consolidated revenue  up from of consolidated revenue in these results were in part due to approximately million related to favorable foreign currency fluctuations  as well as approximately million of incremental revenue from several small acquisitions in late and the first half of excluding these items  our europe division grew approximately resulting from continued strong sales of sap implementation services in almost all of our major operating territories  as well as many of our smaller territories 
despite the strong revenue growth of  the europe division slowed in the fourth quarter of due to the deteriorating economic environment  including two client bankruptcies in late and strength in the us dollar against a number of currencies 
although we presently expect revenue to be flat in this division in as compared to on a local currency basis  assuming foreign currency rates remain at current levels  we estimate a decline in revenue in this division upon translation into us dollars 
state local government revenue growth was driven primarily by increased volumes at one of our largest clients  as well as increased revenue from a few new projects and additional work on existing contracts  most of which was offset by lower revenues following the successful completion of the pennsylvania turnpike commission project 
federal government revenue declined mainly due to the expiration of one of our larger  long term contracts that was subsequently awarded to a qualified small business 
ciber has similarly lost several contracts in recent years because we do not qualify as a small business  therefore  we have been precluded from bidding on the renewal business 
we initially obtained these contracts through acquisitions of qualified small businesses that were originally awarded these contracts 
we submitted proposals on a number of projects in the current year where we would serve as either the prime contractor or a subcontractor  but initially the presidential election and more recently  the current economic environment  have delayed decisions to award and start projects funded by the federal government  thus  we have been unsuccessful in replacing our expired contracts 
the federal government division did have a high number of contract renewals during the current year  of which a sizable majority was won 
for  this division is focused on business development and building backlog for future years 
included in the enterprise solutions division revenue for the current year is approximately million of incremental revenue associated with an acquisition completed in september excluding that acquisition  our enterprise solutions division revenue shrunk over in  compared to our us sap practice had a particularly challenging year as their revenue decreased by million  or  compared to this decrease was partially offset by revenue growth in our oracle higher education and lawson practices 
in  we expect this division to maintain revenues consistent with gross profit 
in total  our gross profit margin improved basis points to for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in gross profit margin on consulting services revenue  which grew by basis points  accounted for 
table of contents the increase 
strong consulting services margin improvements in our commercial  state local government and federal government divisions were responsible 
an increased focus on the pursuit of higher margin business  project pricing and delivery improvement has helped to achieve these results 
europe experienced a basis point decrease in its services gross profit margin in the current year due to a shift in the mix of its service offerings toward longer  fixed term contracts that are more secure yet earn lower gross margins 
the enterprise solutions division had a substantial decrease in its services gross margin for the year ended december   related to several large completed projects that have not yet been successfully replaced  resulting in poor consultant utilization during the year 
in addition  the margins in the enterprise solutions division were hurt by several lower margin fixed price projects 
current year margins on other revenue have declined to from for related to profit margins being squeezed by hardware and software manufacturers 
our commercial and europe divisions are our largest segments  therefore  changes in their margins tend to greatly dictate our consolidated results 
for the year ended december   margin gains in our commercial division were mostly offset by europe s gross margin decreases  resulting in a slight improvement in gross margin over the prior year 
selling  general and administrative 
as a percentage of revenue  sg a expenses increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  over basis points of the increase can be attributed to a million increase in our provision for doubtful receivables between and the remaining basis points related to increased costs in the enterprise solutions  state local government and federal government divisions 
the enterprise solutions division s sg a costs increased due to infrastructure and sales related costs from a mid acquisition 
the state local government and federal government divisions sg a costs increased due to infrastructure investments made to establish a new practice in an existing office and costs incurred to further our ability to bid on large projects as a prime contractor  respectively 
all of the above were partially offset by europe s continuing efforts to drive down their relative sg a spending  despite increased bad debt costs during the current year 
operating income 
as a result of the increased sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue  our operating income decreased basis points to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  operating income by segment division was as follows year ended december  of of change revenue revenue in thousands commercial europe state local government federal government enterprise solutions corporate expenses total amortization of intangibles operating income divisions calculated as a of division revenue  all other calculated as a of total revenue the commercial division s operating income percentage increased basis points due to the division making a strong improvement in gross profit margin on services revenue  some of which was offset by increased sg a costs as a percentage of revenue 
the gross profit margin improvement was due to better pricing on newer engagements  as well as efficient staff utilization 
europe operating income improved basis points  primarily due to a reduction in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue that was attained from operating leverage achieved on higher revenue volumes and reduced overhead personnel costs as a percentage of sales  which were partially offset by higher bad debt expenses 
the improvement in sg a as a percentage of revenue was partially offset by decreased gross profit margins due to a shift in product mix 
europe had fewer high margin software sales in  as well as increased revenues from lower margin  long term outsourcing contracts and increased costs to build additional outsourcing infrastructure 
state local government operating income decreased due to increased sg a costs related to salaries for delivery infrastructure enhancements and increased recruiting costs  which were partially offset by improved margins resulting from pursuing higher margin business 

table of contents the federal government division s operating income was down because increased sg a expenses for operations infrastructure enhancements related to obtaining certifications for prime contractor bidding status more than offset the improvement in this division s consulting services margin 
the enterprise solutions division had an operating loss in the current year compared to a operating income percentage in  primarily due to several large sap projects coming to completion that have not yet been replaced  resulting in lower revenue and lower consultant utilization  as well as lower or negative margins on a couple of fixed price sap projects 
additionally  the division incurred increased sg a costs  some of which are due to increased infrastructure costs from a acquisition  increased sap sales costs on reduced levels of revenue and a bad debt expense resulting from client bankruptcy 
as indicated above  our enterprise solutions division was negatively impacted by losses in our domestic sap practice in as a result  during the second half of  we made a number of significant changes to our domestic sap practice including  restructured leadership  refocused marketing and delivery efforts  as well as implementation of a number of cost reduction measures 
we expect these changes will help improve this division s financial performance in corporate expenses increased by million  primarily as a result of increased share based compensation costs  lower k forfeitures and increased operational support costs 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily resulting from higher cost borrowings under our revolving credit facility that have been utilized to fund repurchases of our lower cost  fixed rate convertible senior subordinated debentures debentures 
our weighted average interest rate under our revolving credit facility was on december   which at present  is only slightly higher than the fixed rate we paid on the retired debentures 
for  interest costs under our revolving credit facility will be variable based on changes in the market rates 
other expense  net 
other expense  net was million in  compared to million in foreign exchange losses were million higher in than in  however  the increased losses were more than offset by a million increase in our net gain on the retirement of our debentures in  as well as a million reduction in minority interest expenses in the current year 
income taxes 
our effective tax rates decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   primarily due to a higher proportion of income being generated in lower tax jurisdictions 
our europe division tends to have a lower effective tax rate than our domestic operations 
in addition  in europe benefitted from lower statutory rates in several countries  as well as having profitable operations in all territories 
europe contributed of our total income before taxes for the year ended december   as compared to during the same period of the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  the us federal research and experimentation tax credit was extended to thus  we recorded the estimated full year benefit of the r e credit during the fourth quarter of comparison of the years ended december  and consolidated the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data in dollars and expressed as a percentage of revenue year ended december  dollars in thousands  except billing rate consulting services other revenue total revenue gross profit consulting services gross profit other revenue gross profit total sg a expenses operating income net income average hourly billing rate consultant utilization average billable headcount revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december   increased compared to total revenue for the year ended december  we are a global company  therefore  our revenue is denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly 
table of contents affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
throughout  the us dollar weakened against many currencies  resulting in favorable currency translation and greater reported us dollar revenues 
for the year ended december   the weak us dollar resulted in an additional million of reported revenue over the year ended december  additionally  a fourth quarter acquisition completed in europe and the domestic sap acquisition completed in september  plus two second quarter european acquisitions contributed incremental revenue of approximately million to the current year results 
excluding the favorable currency translation effects and the incremental revenue from acquisitions  our total revenue for the year ended december   increased from total revenue reported for the year ended december   primarily due to increased sap software related services in europe 
revenue by segment division was as follows year ended december  change in thousands commercial europe state local government federal government enterprise solutions inter segment n m total revenue n m not meaningful commercial division revenue increased during the comparable years due to a couple of new  large clients and engagement wins led by growth in our boston  washington dc and seattle offices 
this division can be characterized in as providing stable contributions  but lacking significant growth 
moving ahead  we are working to position this division to be more successful in gaining market share 
million of the million increase in our europe division revenue was due to favorable foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally  europe had another million of incremental revenue from small acquisitions 
excluding these items  our europe division grew resulting from strong sales of sap implementation services in all of our major operating territories  and extending to australia and new zealand 
in the current year  europe represents approximately of our consolidated revenue  compared to of consolidated revenue in for the first time in our history  during the last quarter of  europe was our largest division for that period 
state local government division revenue growth for was driven by incremental revenue from the pennsylvania turnpike commission project that began in mid however  these gains were more than tempered by a decreasing level of services provided to the city of new orleans during  which resulted in current year revenues that were almost half of revenues earned from the city of new orleans 
for  we have realigned this division on a regional basis and plan to emphasize repeatable solutions to stimulate additional growth opportunities 
the continued revenue decrease in our federal government division is due to a very difficult governmental spending environment  illustrated by funding delays for information technology initiatives 
over the past two years  we have had a couple of our larger  long term federal contracts expire that we have not been able to replace with similar duration contracts 
in  this division focused on qualifying for prime contractor bidding status 
when achieved  prime contractor bidding status will increase our growth opportunities 
over half of the growth in total revenue in our enterprise solutions division  or million during the year ended december   was related to an acquisition completed in september excluding that acquisition  our enterprise solutions division grew over in  compared to software related services  primarily for sap products  are up approximately this year  however  this was partially offset by reduced product commission revenue 
our sales of ibm products have slowed as customers have delayed their orders for some ibm product lines that are in the process of turning over 
we expect our product commission revenues to improve once the new products are released 
gross profit 
in total  our gross profit margin improved basis points to for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in gross profit margin on consulting services revenue  which grew by basis points  accounted for the increase 
the increase in gross profit margin reflects a strong consulting services margin improvement in our enterprise 
table of contents solutions  europe and commercial divisions  which increased by basis points  basis points and basis points  respectively 
additionally  europe s consulting services projects typically have higher gross profit margins compared to similar domestic projects 
with europe delivering a higher percentage of our consolidated revenues  our gross profit margins increase more than if the same revenue was generated domestically 
offsetting the above consulting services margin increases were decreases in consulting services margins of basis points and basis points in our state local government and federal government divisions  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit margin on other revenue to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   was due to reduced margins on software sales primarily in our europe division  as well as a decrease in high margin product commission revenue in our enterprise solutions division 
selling  general and administrative 
as a percentage of revenue  sg a expenses improved slightly to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  our europe and state local government divisions led the improvement for the current year with basis point and basis point improvements  respectively  and was aided by more modest decreases in the enterprise solutions and commercial divisions 
operating income 
as a result of the improved total gross profit margin and the slightly reduced sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue  our operating income improved basis points to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  operating income by segment division was as follows year ended december  of of change revenue revenue in thousands commercial europe state local government federal government enterprise solutions corporate expenses total amortization of intangibles operating income divisions calculated as a of division revenue  all other calculated as a of total revenue commercial division operating income percentage for the current year increased as a large  low margin fixed priced project ended in late and our newer engagements have been yielding slightly better margins 
european division operating income improved primarily due to a reduction in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue that was attained from operating leverage achieved on higher revenue volumes 
the improvement in sg a as a percentage of revenue was partially offset by a basis point decrease in gross margin in although consulting services margins improved by basis points in as europe continued to shift toward more higher margin services  this was more than offset by decreased margins on other revenue 
margins decreased on other revenue due to lower sales of proprietary software products  as well as pricing pressures on our resale of third party software products 
state local government operating income improved in compared to primarily related to million in reduced sg a expenses  which more than offset the decrease in gross profit margin on consulting services in this division 
federal government division operating income for was hurt by lower utilization and some low margin fixed price projects  as well as increased sg a expenses for sales and operations infrastructure enhancements 
enterprise solutions operating income improved considerably given the completion of several low gross profit projects earlier in the current year  as well as improved project delivery 
our improvement in consulting services margins was partially offset by decreased contributions from product commissions in additionally  their reduction in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue also contributed to the improved operating income margin 
other income expense  net 
other expense  net was million in  compared to other income  net of million in minority interest expense increased million in as compared to and foreign currency transaction activity was a net loss 
table of contents of million for the year ended december   compared to a net gain of million for the prior year 
these increased expenses were partially offset by a gain on the retirement of our debentures of million 
income taxes 
our effective tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the tax rate was favorably impacted by recording a multi year benefit from amending certain prior years tax returns because of additional allowable deductions identified  as well as a us federal research and experimentation tax credit 
our effective tax rate in reflected an increase in our us federal research and experimentation tax credit 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of working capital and a current ratio of  compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  historically  we have used our operating cash flow and borrowings  as well as periodic sales of our common stock to finance ongoing operations and business combinations 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  our operating cash flow  proceeds from the sale of our common stock  and our available revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance our working capital needs through at least the next year 
year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign exchange rates on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents our balance of cash and cash equivalents was million at december   compared to a balance of million at december  typically  most of our cash balance is maintained by our european subsidiaries and our domestic cash balances are used daily to reduce our outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility 
from time to time  as permitted under tax regulations  we may engage in short term loans between our us parent company and our foreign subsidiaries 
operating activities 
total accounts receivable decreased to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to improved collection efforts in the current year end  as evidenced by our total accounts receivable day s sales outstanding dso of days at december   compared to days at december  changes in accounts receivable have a significant impact on our cash flow 
items that can affect our accounts receivable dso include contractual payment terms  client payment patterns including approval or processing delays and cash management  client mix public vs 
private  fluctuations in the level of it product sales and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
many of the individual reasons are outside of our control  and  as a result  it is normal for our dso to fluctuate from period to period  affecting our liquidity 
our outstanding accounts receivable balance from the city of new orleans the city was approximately million at december   down from million at december  of our outstanding receivable balance from the city at december   a substantial amount related to work performed following the hurricane disaster 
the city continues to experience administrative complications and fema reimbursement delays  which have delayed payment for our services 
we continue to work with the city and fema on the remaining balance 
in addition  we continue to provide a variety of services to the city and based on our communications with the city  we believe we will be able to collect the balance in full 
accrued compensation and related liabilities increased to million at december   from million at december   due to increased payroll levels in europe 
additionally  these balances are subject to the effects from the timing of our normal bi weekly us payroll cycle 
at december   there were days of unpaid wages  compared to days of unpaid wages at december  in addition  annual bonuses are typically accrued throughout the year and paid in the first quarter of the following year  causing some fluctuation from quarter to quarter 
accounts payable and other accrued liabilities typically fluctuate based on when we receive actual vendor invoices and when they are paid 
the largest of such items typically relates to vendor payments for it hardware and software products that we resell and payments to services related contractors 
other accrued expenses and liabilities decreased to million at december   from million at december   partially due to the settlement of our cross currency interest rate swaps during the current year  which had an unrealized loss of million on our balance sheet at december  additionally  other accrued payables  such as subcontractor expenses were down between the comparable periods

in january  we used million to acquire iteamic pvt 
ltd  a bangalore  india based it services company providing integrated business and technology solutions to established and emerging companies in the united states  europe and asia 
financing activities 
typically  our most significant financing activities consist of the gross borrowings and repayments on our long term bank debt 
during the year ended december   we had net borrowings of million  compared to net borrowings of million for the year ended december   and net repayments of million for the year ended december  the net borrowings in have primarily been used to retire all of our debentures

we may continue to use cash to repurchase our common stock subject to limitations under our revolving credit facility discussed below 
convertible senior subordinated debentures 
in a private placement on december   we issued million of debentures due to mature in december under the debentures  holders had the ability to require us to repurchase their debentures on december    and  or at any time prior to their maturity in the case of certain events  at a repurchase price of of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
due to our stock price and market interest rates over the past months  we began to repurchase the debentures in late in anticipation that we would be required to repurchase any remaining debentures on december  during  we repurchased and retired million of our debentures  leaving million outstanding at december  we paid million to repurchase debentures in resulting in a gain of million 
during  we repurchased the remaining million  with the final repurchase occurring on december   upon the election of the holders

beginning on march   and continuing through december   the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility will be reduced by million each quarter end 
the revolving credit facility matures on february   at which time the remaining maximum credit available will terminate and all outstanding balances must be repaid in full 
additionally  the revolving credit facility is subject to mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions in amounts equal to the net cash proceeds resulting from specified events such as asset dispositions  event of loss  issuance or incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of equity  subject in each case to specified thresholds and other exceptions 
on february   we completed an offering for the sale of  shares of ciber  inc common stock at per share 
net proceeds from the sale totaled approximately million after commissions and expenses and were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as required 
the net proceeds from the sale also reduced the amount available to us under the revolving credit facility to approximately million 
additionally  the underwriters have a day option to purchase up to an additional  shares from us at the public offering price of per share less the underwriting discount 
any future net proceeds that we receive from the underwriters option would also go to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and would further reduce the amount available under the revolving credit facility 
at our choice  our borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at rates calculated in reference to either the wells fargo prime lending rate prime plus a margin that ranges from to  or a london interbank offered rate libor for one to six month maturities  plus a margin that ranges from to

we are required to be in compliance with the financial covenants at the end of each calendar quarter  and we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of december   however  given the current volatile economic conditions  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance at future quarter ends 
based on management s current estimates  we do not currently believe a covenant violation to be probable of occurring through at least december  at december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under the revolving credit facility without violating the financial covenants 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any reportable off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions  changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the following table is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total thereafter in thousands principal payments on long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total on february   we completed an offering for the sale of  shares of ciber  inc common stock at per share 
net proceeds from the sale totaled approximately million after commissions and expenses and were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility as required 
the net proceeds from the sale also reduced the amount available to us under the revolving credit facility to approximately million 
additionally  the underwriters have a day option to purchase up to an additional  shares from us at the public offering price of per share less the underwriting discount 
any future net proceeds that we receive from the underwriters option would also go to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and would further reduce the amount available under the revolving credit facility 
interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related agreements and effective interest rates as of december   for our fixed and variable rate borrowings 
includes operating leases for all office locations  automobiles and office equipment

the fsp requires that the proceeds from the issuance of certain convertible debt instruments be allocated between a liability component issued at a discount and the embedded conversion option ie  the equity component in a manner that reflects the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
the difference between the principal amount of the debt and the amount of the proceeds allocated to the liability component will be reported as a debt discount and subsequently amortized to earnings as additional non cash interest expense over the convertible debt s expected life using the effective interest method

we continually evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience 
we believe that our estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable based on information available to us at the time they are made 
to the extent there are differences between our estimates  judgments and assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
such differences may be material to our financial statements 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are described below 
revenue recognition ciber earns revenue primarily from providing it services to its clients  and to a much lesser extent  from the sale and resale of it hardware and software products 
ciber s consulting services revenue comes from three primary sources  technology integration services where we design  build and implement new or enhanced system applications and related processes  general it consulting services  such as system selection or assessment  feasibility studies  training and staffing and managed it services in which we manage  staff  maintain  host or otherwise run solutions and or systems provided to our customers 
contracts for these services have different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement  which require management to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenue 
fees for these contracts may be in the form of time and materials  cost plus or fixed price 
the majority of our consulting services revenue is recognized under time and materials contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
consulting services revenue also includes project related reimbursable expenses separately billed to clients 
revenue for technology integration consulting services where we design redesign  build and implement new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for our clients is generally recognized based on the percentage of completion method in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
under the percentage of completion method  management estimates the percentage of completion based upon the contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract costs 
if the total cost estimate exceeds revenue  we accrue for the estimated loss immediately 
the use of the percentage of completion method requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenue and costs  including assumptions as to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in estimated costs 
estimates of 
table of contents total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 
revenue for general it consulting services is recognized as work is performed and amounts are earned in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for contracts with fees based on time and materials or cost plus  we recognize revenue over the period of performance 
for fixed price contracts  depending on the specific contractual provisions and nature of the deliverables  revenue may be recognized on a proportional performance model based on level of effort  as milestones are achieved or when final deliverables have been provided 
managed it services arrangements typically span several years 
revenue from managed services time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from unit priced contracts is recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized on a straight line basis  unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs related to delivering managed services are expensed as incurred  with the exception of labor and other direct costs related to the set up of processes  personnel and systems  which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period services are provided 
amounts billable to the client for transition or set up activities are also deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period that the managed services are provided 
revenue for contracts with multiple elements is accounted for pursuant to emerging issues task force issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables or sop  software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on arrangements with multiple deliverables as separate units of accounting only if certain criteria are met 
if such criteria are not met  then combined accounting is applied to all deliverables and all revenue is recognized based on the accounting applicable to the last element to be delivered 
other revenue includes resale of third party it hardware and software products  sales of proprietary software and commissions on sales of it products 
some software sales arrangements also include implementation services and or post contract customer support 
in such multi element arrangements  if the criteria are met  revenue is recognized based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each element 
software support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement 
revenue related to the sale of it products is generally recognized when the products are shipped or if applicable  when delivered and installed in accordance with the terms of the sale 
where we are the re marketer of certain it products  commission revenue is recognized when the products are drop shipped from the vendor to the customer 
our commission revenue represents the sales price to the customer less the cost paid to the vendor 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue based on services performed in advance of billings in accordance with contract terms 
under our typical time and materials billing arrangement  we bill our customers on a regularly scheduled basis  such as biweekly or monthly 
at the end of each accounting period  we accrue revenue for services performed since the last billing cycle 
these unbilled amounts are generally billed the following month 
unbilled accounts receivable also arise when percentage of completion accounting is used and costs plus estimated contract earnings exceed billings 
such amounts are billed at specific milestone dates or at contract completion 
management expects all unbilled accounts receivable to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date 
billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue and are primarily comprised of deferred software support revenue 
goodwill at december   we had million of goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is subject to impairment testing 
we review goodwill for impairment annually at june  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in december  we performed an interim test for goodwill impairment 
we considered the significant decline in our stock price  causing our market capitalization to fall significantly below our book value  as well as our competitors stock prices and market and economic conditions generally  to be indicative of a triggering event for the impairment test 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is considered not to be impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

table of contents determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
our most recent interim goodwill impairment analysis  which was performed during december  did not result in an impairment charge 
the forecasts utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis as part of our december interim impairment test assumes future growth in each of our reporting units during the next five years and beyond 
our federal and enterprise solutions business units had decreases in their operating income or losses during we expect this trend to change in future periods based on developments in these businesses in recent periods 
if these business units can t obtain  or are not expected to obtain the projected levels of profitability  future impairment tests may result in an impairment charge 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
as a global company  we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction  as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed 
we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense 
in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect our overall effective tax rate 
we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities  and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes plus interest and possible penalties 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law  we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of a tax benefit will not be realized as the result of an audit 
we evaluate these reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the estimates of tax benefits to be realized  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable 
however  final determinations of prior year tax liabilities  either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations  could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions 
the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision  net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any known tax contingencies 
no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements  necessitate that these earnings be distributed  an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply  which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
at december   we had gross accounts receivable of million and our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific identification of probable losses 
we review our accounts receivable and reassess our estimates of collectability each month 
historically  our bad debt expense has been a very small percentage of our total revenue  as most of our revenues are from large  credit worthy fortune companies and governments 
during  as global economic conditions worsened  we experienced an unusually high number of client bankruptcies and financial difficulties 
our bad debt expense increased to million in as compared to million in if our clients financial condition or liquidity were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if customers were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
at december   our outstanding accounts receivable balance from the city of new orleans the city was approximately million  down from million at december  the city continues to experience administrative complications and fema reimbursement delays  which have delayed payment for our services 
we continue to work with the city and fema on the remaining balance 
in addition  we continue to provide a variety of services to the city and based on our communications with the city  we believe we will be able to collect the balance in full 
therefore  we have not provided for any reserves related to this balance at december  we cannot be assured that we will be successful in our collection efforts 
should the city s financial condition deteriorate or should other information arise in the future to indicate that we may not be paid in full  we would have to provide for an appropriate reserve at such time 

table of contents accrued compensation and certain other accrued liabilities employee compensation costs are our largest expense category 
we have several different variable compensation programs  which are highly dependent on estimates and judgments  particularly at interim reporting dates 
some programs are discretionary  while others have quantifiable performance metrics 
certain programs are annual  while others are quarterly or monthly 
often actual compensation amounts cannot be determined until after our results are reported 
we believe we make reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
we also estimate the amounts required for incurred but not reported health claims under our self insured employee benefit programs 
our accrual for health costs is based on historical experience and actual amounts may vary 
in the ordinary course of business  we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
we periodically review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
we use significant judgment in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information at that time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we expense legal fees as incurred 
other intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions  we are required to recognize other intangible assets separate and apart from goodwill  if such assets arise from contractual or other legal rights or if such assets are separable from the acquired business 
other intangible assets primarily include  among other things  customer related assets such as order backlog  customer contracts and customer relationships 
determining a fair value for such items requires a high degree of judgment  assumptions and estimates 
we often use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
in addition  these intangible assets are amortized over our best estimate of their useful life 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to market risks is immaterial 
during   or million of our total revenue was attributable to our foreign operations 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would change total revenue by  or million 
a portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
additionally  we have exposure to changes in foreign currency rates related to short term inter company transactions with our foreign subsidiaries and from client receivables in different currencies 
foreign sales are mostly made by our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in their local currency as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
periodically  we enter into cross currency swap arrangements with a financial institution to partially hedge the net assets of certain foreign operations net investment hedges and offset the foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our investments in these foreign operations 
increases and decreases in the net investment in our subsidiaries due to foreign exchange volatility will be partially offset by foreign exchange losses and gains from the net investment hedge  both of which are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   we had no outstanding net investment hedges 
we manage credit risk related to our net investment hedges through careful selection of the financial institution utilized as the counterparty 
our exposure to changes in interest rates arises primarily because our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility has a variable interest rate 
at december   our outstanding borrowings under revolving credit facility were million and our weighted average interest rate was 
assuming million of outstanding debt  a increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional interest expense
